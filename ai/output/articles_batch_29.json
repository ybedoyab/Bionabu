Keywords: diabetes type 1, beta cell replacement therapy, islet, scalability, stem cell derived beta cells At the 48th Annual Conference ISPAD, held on 13–16 October 2022, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, I was invited to deliver a lecture titled The Last Mile for Type 1 Diabetes cure [1]. The intention behind this title was to highlight the ambivalence of the concept: while many interpreted it optimistically as signaling the imminent arrival of a definitive cure, the phrase also carries a cautionary meaning. In many fields, the “last mile” is often the most complex and challenging stage of development, requiring careful navigation to ensure successful implementation [2]. History teaches us that assuming victory just before the finish line is a surefire way to trip over our own shoelaces. The field of beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is currently undergoing a remarkable transformation [3]. Over the past two decades, the well-established islet transplantation paradigm has provided compelling proof-of-concept evidence that restoring endogenous insulin production can lead to long-term glycemic control, protection from severe hypoglycemia, and improved quality of life [4–11]. However, the approach remains fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of organ donors, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, and the challenges associated with islet engraftment and survival [11–13]. In other words, we have a therapy that works beautifully—just for not enough people to make a real difference. Recent breakthroughs in stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and gene editing are now reshaping the landscape, with the potential to overcome these intrinsic limitations [14–17]. The successful differentiation of stem cell-derived beta-like cells—whether from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—into insulin-producing cells suitable for transplantation represents a paradigm shift [18–23]. Initial clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, with promising preliminary data showing functional insulin secretion in vivo [24–30]. The possibility of encapsulating or genetically engineering these cells to evade immune rejection could eventually obviate the need for chronic immunosuppression, further expanding the therapeutic potential [3, 4]. This progress is the culmination of decades of interdisciplinary research, bringing us to an exciting and optimistic phase in the field. But before we start popping champagne, let’s remember that many promising scientific advances have met their demise at the hands of real-world implementation challenges. As we celebrate these successes, it’s important to recognize the complexity of what lies ahead. While the idea of the “last mile” in beta-cell replacement may suggest we are nearing a definitive solution, history shows that the final phase often brings its most rewarding challenges, offering opportunities for further breakthroughs and innovation. To illustrate this, we can draw an analogy to space exploration. Sending the first humans to the moon was one of the most significant technological feats in modern history, showcasing the scientific ingenuity of our species. Can we say that humanity has mastered lunar travel? Certainly. Have we transitioned from exploration to colonization? Not even close. The Apollo program, which successfully landed twelve men on the moon over 12 years, cost an estimated $288 billion in today’s currency and required the effort of 400,000 people. Was it worth it? Undoubtedly. The benefits of space exploration extended far beyond the moon landings themselves, driving innovations in computing, materials science, and medicine. But if our goal had been to establish a thriving lunar metropolis, we would have been woefully unprepared. The engineering required to sustain a permanent presence on the moon is vastly different from what was needed for brief exploration missions. Similarly, while we have demonstrated that stem cell-derived beta cells can function in human recipients, scaling this intervention to treat millions of individuals with T1D presents a new set of challenges [31–34]. We’ve planted the flag, but we’re nowhere near ready to move in. For now, we must acknowledge that only a select few will have access to this groundbreaking therapy in its early stages. Let’s be realistic: sending twelve men to the moon was a tremendous achievement, but building the infrastructure to support thousands is an entirely different level of challenge—and a much greater one when scaling up to millions. If we continue to approach beta cell replacement with an “Apollo mission” mindset, we risk creating a therapy that could be limited in accessibility. This would necessitate either stringent stratification based on risk-benefit analysis or, in a more troubling scenario, allocation based on financial capacity [35, 36]. It’s important to note that the biomedical field, while it shares some characteristics with space exploration in terms of complexity, is inherently different. The decentralized, iterative nature of biomedical research allows for faster and more varied innovation, often driven by global collaboration, and offers a more dynamic landscape than the singular focus of space exploration. In this regard, the biomedical field has some distinct advantages, such as flexibility and the potential for rapid progress due to the contributions of many smaller, specialized teams rather than relying on a monolithic, top-down approach. But there are also disadvantages to this fragmented approach. Without a central focus, there is a risk of research becoming too diffuse, lacking the critical mass of knowledge and resources needed to make real breakthroughs in a timely manner. The dispersed nature of the research may lead to silos of knowledge, and sometimes, these separate efforts can lack the cohesion necessary to propel the field forward efficiently. In the case of beta-cell replacement therapy, for instance, without a unified, coordinated strategy, progress may be delayed, and key challenges, such as creating scalable and affordable solutions, could remain unresolved. Perhaps we do not fully consider the complexities of the “last mile” in scientific progress, where the challenges of scaling and ensuring widespread accessibility can be more intricate and demanding than the initial breakthroughs themselves. A recent reflection on human genome editing serves as a case in point [37]. It has been suggested that polygenic genome editing could become feasible within the next three decades, with theoretical models indicating that it could significantly reduce susceptibility to diseases such as coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s, depression, diabetes, and schizophrenia. This is an intriguing prospect with profound ethical implications, but one thing is already clear and underestimated: this approach is unlikely to be applied to a significant portion of the population within any realistic timeframe. Why? Because it would require in vitro fertilization for every individual undergoing genome editing [38]. Once again, we have explored the possibility, but we have not “colonized” it. For a more immediate comparison to beta cell therapy, let’s assume for a moment that, starting today, we could transplant pancreatic islets without requiring immunosuppression. Would that mean we have reached the last mile in curing type 1 diabetes? Not at all. The number of donors would remain severely limited, and the procedure, still highly dependent on skilled operators, could not be automated or broadly implemented. Therefore, only a small group would have access, and this does not even take into account the cost factor. Indeed, when considering the “last mile” in cell-based therapies, one of the major challenges is the cost, which may prevent the therapy from being automated or widely implemented. The case of gene and cell therapies for rare diseases serves as a cautionary tale [39]. Several promising therapies have been approved but later withdrawn from the market due to unsustainable pricing models and difficulties in reimbursement [40, 41]. Notable examples include Glybera, the first gene therapy approved in Europe, which was withdrawn in 2017, after being deemed commercially unviable, and Strimvelis, a gene therapy for ADA-SCID, which faced similar market challenges. News has recently emerged about the suspension of the development and commercialization of the hemophilia B gene therapy fidanacogene elaparvovec (marketed as Beqvez in the United States and Durveqtix in Europe) by Pfizer [42]. Fidanacogene elaparvovec marks the ninth advanced therapy to be withdrawn from the European market since 2015, a significant figure considering that only 27 such therapies have reached commercialization in total [43]. Notably, no patients appear to have received the therapy after its approval in the United States. Its price tag—$3.5 million per patient—certainly does not lend itself to widespread adoption. Another shake-up in the sector came with the recent developments surrounding bluebird bio, Inc. Founded with the mission of developing gene therapies for rare diseases, the company had already sparked debate over the sustainability of advanced therapies back in 2021, following the simultaneous withdrawal of two gene therapies from the European market—one for beta-thalassemia and the other for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (the latter of which remained available for only 3 months). Once valued at $11 billion in 2018, bluebird bio faced mounting financial difficulties due to high development costs and limited market access. Recently, the company was acquired by U.S. funds for a mere $30 million—a staggering devaluation that underscores the economic challenges plaguing biotech firms specializing in advanced therapies. 1 The model used for rare disease therapies may not be directly applicable to widespread conditions like T1D, especially when scaling therapies like beta-cell replacement. In rare diseases, high per-patient costs are manageable, but for large populations, cost-reduction strategies are essential. A key approach is leveraging economies of scale, particularly in allogeneic therapies, where a single batch can treat multiple patients, spreading fixed costs and reducing per-patient expenses. However, autologous therapies face limitations in this regard due to the need for individualized production, which results in higher costs. Advancements in automation and bioprocessing technologies could reduce costs for both autologous and allogeneic therapies, but there are risks. Despite technological innovations, therapies may remain financially unfeasible for large populations due to high raw material costs, specialized facilities, and regulatory hurdles. Additionally, cost-reduction efforts must not compromise the therapy’s quality or efficacy, as this could undermine its long-term success. So, the real question is: how we can successfully and safely navigate the “last mile”? One option is to place unwavering faith in scientific progress, if what seems impossible today will inevitably become reality. After all, history is filled with once-fantastical ideas that have materialized into everyday technology. In Star Trek (1964), the crew communicated using sleek, flip-open devices—perfect for intergalactic adventures. Three decades later, Motorola’s StarTAC brought that vision to life. Waiting, as Samuel Beckett illustrated in Waiting for Godot, carries profound human dignity. But waiting can also turn into a tragicomedy if it assumes that progress has no intrinsic limits—that it is merely a matter of time. A second option is to take a different approach, drawing inspiration from the Quality by Design (QbD) framework [44–46]. For those unfamiliar with it, QbD is, above all, a philosophy that shifts the focus from quality control to quality by intentional design. It emphasizes that quality should not be tested into a product but rather built into it from the very beginning. At the core of QbD is the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), which defines the desired characteristics of a product, guiding its entire development. Fundamentally, the QbD approach marks a shift from a reactive, retrospective evaluation to a proactive, predictive model. Traditional quality control methods often rely on detecting and correcting issues after production. In contrast, QbD anticipates critical points and constraints during the design phase, allowing for a better understanding of the boundaries within which the process must operate. This shift from “test-and-fix” to “design-and-predict” enables more robust, efficient, and scalable therapeutic solutions, particularly in emerging fields like cell therapy. This concept is particularly crucial in the field of cell therapy, where the QTPP is not just about the intrinsic properties of the cellular product itself. Unlike conventional pharmaceuticals, cell therapies are living drugs, meaning their effectiveness and behavior depend on the dynamic interaction with the patient receiving the treatment. This reciprocal relationship between the therapy and the individual means that the QTPP must account for factors such as patient-specific responses, variability in the cellular product, and the evolving nature of the treatment within the body. It is not my intention here to delve into the numerous complex aspects associated with the QbD approach in the field of beta-cell transplantation, aspects that are far from irrelevant. For example, defining Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) for stem cell-derived beta cells (such as insulin secretion kinetics and purity) requires standardized assays, which remain underdeveloped. Even the discussion regarding the quality and potency of human pancreatic islets remains extensive [47]. To provide a sense of this complexity, in the recent FDA discussions concerning the approval of the Biologics License Application for pancreatic islets, 2 potency criteria were suggested based on parameters such as ≥70% viable islets, counting based on DTZ staining and microscopic evaluation, as well as the ratio of insulin secretion under high glucose stimulation to low glucose stimulation (≥1). Ironically, some probiotic strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, could potentially exhibit similar metrics under certain conditions [48], highlighting the complexity and challenges in defining appropriate potency criteria for beta cel replacement. Moreover, regulatory alignment with agencies like the FDA/EMA is also understated and warrants more attention. Regulatory agencies play a critical role in the successful development, approval, and commercialization of novel therapies. However, in the case of beta-cell replacement therapies, particularly those derived from stem cells, there is a need for more comprehensive alignment with regulatory standards and guidelines. Instead, in this context, I propose the broader adoption of the QTPP concept. Rather than focusing solely on traditional product quality parameters, QTPP advocates for a more comprehensive, patient-centered approach—an approach especially vital in the realm of stem cell-based therapies like beta-cell transplantation. The challenge goes beyond simply creating a functional cellular product; it is also about ensuring its scalability, as a transformative therapy that remains accessible to only a few is little more than an academic achievement. Therefore, rather than concentrating exclusively on the intrinsic qualities of the cellular product, a key step should be the definition of the QTPP—not only in terms of what the therapy is, but also how it will be administered, how it will interact with the patient, and the broader context in which it will be applied (Figure 1). If this is the lens through which we view the problem, then as a physician-scientist, I must wonder: what kind of product would I actually want to use? Ideally, it would be cryopreserved and easily thawed at the bedside with warm water, compatible with a standard syringe, and administered much like a simple intramuscular injection—no operating room, no GMP facility for post-thaw reconstitution, no angiographic suite for infusion, etc… A final product of just a few milliliters, nothing more. From this endpoint, we must work backward, establishing constraints from the outset. The goal is not to design a product that functions beautifully under ideal conditions but one that remains viable when deployed at scale. The constraints should not reflect what is manageable for an expert in a specialized lab or clinic but what is operationally feasible for millions of patients worldwide. Returning to the Apollo 13 analogy, the lesson lies in NASA’s approach to solving the air filter crisis [49]. They could have designed the ideal filtration system from scratch—but instead, they worked within the limits of what was already onboard, using available materials to construct a viable solution. In today’s terms, this was an exercise in design thinking, and it is precisely the mindset we need before moving forward. Recognizing this early is critical. It informs the definition of QTPPs and CQAs, which, in turn, shape every aspect of development—including procedural simplicity, implant size, and invasiveness. Consider this: if we could eliminate the need for an angiographic suite, a surgical team, or anything beyond local anesthesia, would not that already be a breakthrough? Similarly, as a healthcare provider, I must consider: how much can I afford to spend on beta-cell therapy for an individual with T1D? Defining this is essential, as sustainability is a key element of scalability, and in my view, it should be incorporated into the QTPP definition. In this regard, there should be a stronger focus on academic research into the economics of Beta-Cell Replacement Therapy. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the economic sustainability of therapies is not only about cost-effectiveness but also about broader financial considerations. This was demonstrated in the past with hepatitis C treatments in countries with advanced public welfare systems [50]. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Two beautifully designed wine glasses that perfectly match the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for a wine glass, yet fail in real-world usability due to a lack of consideration for the interaction with the drinker during the design and prediction phase. Both glasses exhibit ideal material quality, clarity, durability, and aesthetic appeal, fulfilling all standard QTPP criteria. They are made of high-quality, lead-free crystal, ensuring clarity and safety. Their shape and design feature an optimized bowl size and rim thickness to enhance aroma. The capacity and volume allow for proper aeration and optimal serving. They are scratch- and shatter-resistant, suitable for repeated use. Their weight and balance make them comfortable to hold, while their design ensures stability. They are easy to clean, dishwasher-safe, and resistant to stains and odors. Finally, they are scalable for mass production while maintaining quality. However, despite excelling in these technical attributes, the glasses overlook a crucial factor: the interaction between the glass and the drinker: they have an extravagant yet impractical design, making it impossible to drink from without spilling. This serves as a metaphor for the importance of a holistic approach in Quality by Design (QbD): a product must not only meet its defined quality criteria but also be practical, user-friendly, and functional in real-world applications—a principle that applies equally to wine glasses and therapeutic innovations. The represent glasees are part of “The Uncomfortable,” a collection of everyday objects that have been intentionally redesigned to be impractical by Athens-based architect Katerina Kamprani.This phase should begin as soon as possible. Who should take responsibility for it? Undoubtedly, highly specialized academic centers with the necessary multidisciplinary expertise should lead the initial phase, overseeing both the design thinking process and, subsequently, the early-stage clinical trials to optimize the best conditions for implementation. These centers should work in close collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry, respecting each other’s areas of expertise and competencies. Following this initial development, a “hub-and-spoke” model should be adopted to enable broader dissemination. From these central expertise hubs, the process can gradually expand, ensuring that the therapy becomes accessible on a larger scale while maintaining the necessary standards of quality and feasibility. Supporting initiatives in this direction is essential, and projects like ACT (Accelerate Cell Therapies; 3 ) by Breakthrough T1D serve as a prime example. ACT aims to significantly accelerate the availability of cell therapy products by uniting efforts in research, development, regulation, and clinical access. A core aspect of this initiative is the establishment of Clinical Centers of Reference for Cell Therapy—expert, multidisciplinary facilities that will play a key role in the fast-tracked adoption of “off-the-shelf” cell therapies. These centers will not only provide advanced treatments but also function as training hubs, helping other centers develop the expertise needed to deliver cutting-edge therapies. By prioritizing collaboration, training, and standardization of care, ACT and similar effort has the potential to ensure that life-changing therapies are accessible to millions of T1D patients worldwide. A historical precedent for this approach can be found in bone marrow transplantation, which remains the only true cell therapy widely adopted on a global scale [51]. The foundations of this therapy were laid in the mid-20th century, with pioneering work by E. Donnall Thomas and George Mathé, who demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow could be used to reconstitute the blood and immune system in patients with leukemia and other blood disorders. Their work led to the first successful human transplants in the 1960s. Initially, bone marrow transplants were highly experimental and confined to specialized centers. Over time, through continuous optimization of conditioning regimens, donor matching (HLA typing), and graft-versus-host disease management, the procedure became more standardized and scalable. Today, it is an established treatment for thousands of patients worldwide, facilitated by international donor registries and improved cryopreservation techniques that allow for broader accessibility. This evolution underscores the importance of starting with a highly controlled, expert-driven development phase, followed by a strategic expansion model to make cell therapies practical and available on a large scale. Ultimately, if we are serious about completing the “last mile” in beta cell replacement, we must acknowledge that it is not a simple continuation of our current trajectory. It demands a fundamental shift in strategy—one that prioritizes not just scientific and technical innovation but also scalability, accessibility, and economic feasibility. Only by adopting this perspective can we transform beta cell replacement from experimental success into a truly viable treatment for millions of people with T1D. How long do we need to wait for having an exogenous insulin-free world? In all honesty, we do not know, but I am sure that the generation of individual with type 1 diabetes who will be definitively cured by beta cel replacement is already born. In the meantime, maintaining the parallel with the moon mission, we must push forward with unwavering commitment, as President John F. Kennedy said: “…We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too (Rice Stadium on September 12, 1962)” This same spirit should guide our efforts in making beta-cell replacement a reality for those who need it most.

    "abstract": "Abstract The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD (phyD) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Gravity plays a key role in plant growth [1]. Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a flowering plant that has been chosen by biologists as a model plant organism to study the effects of gravity and other environmental stressors, since it has a short life cycle and because of the existence of a multitude of mutants and transgenic plants. The current visibility of Arabidopsis research reflects the growing realization among biologists that this simple angiosperm can serve as a convenient model not only for plant biology but also for addressing fundamental questions of biological structure and function common to all Eukaryotes [2]. To achieve the goal of providing long term life support for deep space missions a fundamental knowledge on plant growth in spaceflight has to be gained. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently equipped with all capabilities to collect data needed to address fundamental questions of plant physiology and development in spaceflight microgravity [3]. In this article, we are interested in identifying the genes that show transcriptional abundance under the influence of spaceflight microgravity, and the genes primarily influencing root growth and cell wall biosynthesis in spaceflight. The transcriptomic profile of Arabidopsis has been studied in simulated microgravity [4]. The effect of gravity and mechanical stimulation on the growth of the root apex of Arabidopsis has resulted in transient changes in gene expressions [5]. The effect of spaceflight microgravity on Arabidopsis root growth is presented in [6]. Cell wall modeling in the roots, shoots, and hypocotyls of plants is an important metabolic adaptation brought about by genes and proteins. Metabolic phenotyping of Arabidopsis has been carried out on the ground [7]. Metabolic fingerprinting is important for improving the quality of crops grown in spaceflight. Several of the cell wall proteome changes have been corroborated with transcriptomic changes in spaceflight [8]. As plants are important for the bioregenerative life support in spaceflight, the cell wall perturbations may affect the yield of crops grown in the altered spaceflight environment [9]. Of the 33 XTH Arabidopsis root growth genes, XTH17 to XTH20 are the main contributors [10]. Nucleotide sugar interconversions in plants are discussed in [11,12]. From terrestrial studies, nucleotide-diphsopho-(NPD) sugar interconversion enzymes (NSE) of the small dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily are given in [13]. Plant Cell Wall (PCW) genes were identified using gene co-expression analysis in [14], and it was shown how these genes are transcriptionally co-regulated [15]. These sugars require subtle quantitative control during plant root growth and development. Hence, it is important to identify the genes that encode these enzymes involved in regulating growth of adventitious roots, and their waving and skewing in spaceflight microgravity. Researchers have used various ecotypes and mutants of Arabidopsis to isolate genes with transcriptional variation in spaceflight environment compared to on the ground. Since we are not doing the experiment and performing the data collection, we rely on datasets available from GeneLab for plants grown in spaceflight microgravity. GeneLab provides transcriptomic datasets for various ecotypes of Arabidopsis from spaceflight. The Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0 showed differential gene expression due to oxidative stress in spaceflight [16]. Differential gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis exposed over six days to blue light at different levels of gravity in comparison to unit gravity control has been presented in [17], and it was found that blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce stress due to lower levels of gravity in spaceflight. It was found that plants in spaceflight microgravity grow slower than plants in unit gravity on the ground. Two ecotypes of Arabidopsis (WS and Col-0) were grown in spaceflight under directional light, and it was found that skewing and waving of roots were independent of gravity, the roots were negatively phototropic, and both ecotypes skewed differently in the presence of light, due to a lack of gravity [18]. Major organ-specific and cellular remodeling of Arabidopsis has been identified from its growth in ISS and physiological adaptation to spaceflight [3,19]. Previous literature, cited above, characterized unique transcriptions in WS, Col-0, and PhyD mutant of Arabidopsis using heat maps and fold change analysis methods. For all the genome analysis done, no phenotypic measurements have been presented or discussed. However, the gradient-light experiments conducted in the ISS resulted in the plant root growth in a skewing pattern. These were dramatic observations of phenotype changes concerning root growth and cell wall response in microgravity. Hence, we have chosen the GLDS-7 [3] and GLDS-120 [20] datasets collected under different lighting settings for applying our network analysis methods. The biochemical interactions within a cell of a biological system are formulated as gene regulatory networks for modeling biological processes. GRNs are used to represent regulatory and transcriptional functions that underlie cellular, molecular, and biological phenomena. GRNs have become an indispensable tool that facilitates interpretation of biological processes, molecular functions, protein interactions, genome to phenome analysis, cellular differentiation, identification of genes as biomarkers, and the response of an organism to external stimuli. A Bayesian network generation method for GRN constructed for Arabidopsis has been presented [21]. Several machine learning algorithms have been implemented for the generation of these networks [22]. In [23], several statistical and machine learning methods have been reviewed for the prediction of GRNs from transcriptome datasets. In [24], many algorithms for GRN inferencing from single-cell transcriptomic data are benchmarked using simulated data. Several GRNs have been generated to study root development in Arabidopsis [25]. Vascular root development has been represented using GRNs in [26]. Furthermore, Arabidopsis secondary cell wall synthesis has been studied using a protein-DNA regulatory network and genes involved in secondary cell wall modeling, which form the cell shape and the bulk of the plant biomass [27]. Other GRNs for Arabidopsis growth and development are presented in [28]. Gene Ontology is the process of classifying an annotated gene to a particular function. Gene set enrichment analysis is used to determine changes of expression in groups of a priori defined gene sets. Additional web-tools and databases are available for Arabidopsis gene expression analysis [29]. These GRN studies do not identify hub genes and the target (authority) genes they regulate in spaceflight microgravity compared to on the ground for important biological processes that are affected in spaceflight, nor perform rigorous graph theoretic network analysis and derive biological interpretations. We have used three basic graph-based network approaches in this paper (1) the LASSO, (2) Pearson correlation, and (3) HITS methods. LASSO and Pearson correlation methods are applied to construct GRNs of transcriptional regulations in spaceflight microgravity as well as ground control. Section 2 presents the materials and methods used for GRN inferencing and analysis. In Section 3, we present the results of the GRN analysis of the significant hub genes (identified from Pearson and HITS method) with the highest transcriptional abundance in spaceflight microgravity. Results from network analysis of the Arabidopsis ecotypes and genotype are discussed in this section. The root growth and cell wall genes affected in spaceflight microgravity are isolated and their molecular functions are discussed. Section 4 presents the conclusions.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. GeneLab Arabidopsis Datasets We have mined GeneLab GLDS-7 and GLDS -120 datasets for identifying hub genes that are affected by spaceflight. The GLDS-7 dataset contains microarray gene expression data for the Arabidopsis WS and Col-0 ecotypes for different tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) for the plants grown in ground control and spaceflight in white light. GLDS-120 contains the transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) ecotypes, and the gene Phytochrome D (phyD) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are 4–6 umoles m-2 s-1 of total light and dark in spaceflight and on the ground. The design of the experiment was to investigate the effect of light on Arabidopsis root growth when the gravity stimuli were nullified. The phyD mutant was used, since it is a known light-related mutant in Col-0 background. RNAseq is used for transcription profiling. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes. 2.2. Graph-Based GRN Inferencing We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G = (V, E) where V is the vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and E is an ordered pair of vertices (u, v) that are called the edges (arcs), respectively [30]. One important advantage of the representation of networks by graphs is that they have an intuitive graphical representation. In a directed graph G = (V, E, o, t), e = (u, v) are the edges, the origin of e is denoted by o(e), and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a positive real-valued weight w(e). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is applied to de-correlate the gene expression values. PCA is done to reduce the dimensions to three main components corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix computed from the graph representation of the gene expression data. PCA projects the data on to an orthogonal space, such that the variance of the projected data is maximized. This space is lower in dimension with minimum projection cost. PCA is applied to the gene expression datasets before performing both LASSO regression and Pearson correlation GRN construction. 2.2.1. LASSO Regression Lasso is a linear regression algorithm that shrinks the data towards a central point. Lasso regression mostly leads to sparse models. Lasso uses the l1 regularization, which means it adds a penalty that is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients. Lasso regression is computationally feasible and can fit any kind of statistical data [31]. l1 regularization is applied to eliminate the relationship between the genes with the least importance. The Lasso regression is constructed according to the description in [31]. We have used the SILGGM package in R for the Lasso Regression [32]. In this algorithm, every gene present in the data is considered as a transcription factor, as well as a target gene, and the correlation between each gene with the other is calculated using the scaled Lasso algorithm. The results from the regression are used to construct GRNs in Cytoscape for the sub-modules of the genes of Arabidopsis spaceflight and ground datasets. The method has been applied to the GeneLab GLDS-120 dataset.2.2.2. Pearson Correlation Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two genes (variables, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations: ρX,Y=cov(X,Y)σXσY (1) Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two random variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not specifically identified. In this study, we use the Pearson correlation to construct the co-expressed gene network to identify genes with correlated expression patterns. This method is based on an adjusted threshold p-value to accommodate multiple hypotheses; the correlation between expression patterns is calculated for every pair of genes. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered to be co-expressed if their p-value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold p-value. The t-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and hence, that there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the nodes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intra-module (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks. Figure 1 shows the steps involved in generating the GRN from the microarray gene expression dataset using this method. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Flow chart of the procedure for gene regulatory network inferencing using the graph-based Pearson correlation method.2.2.3. Sparse Networks and the Weighted HITS Algorithm We show that the GRN generated for the GeneLab Arabidopsis datasets are sparse networks or graphs. We define sparsity precisely so that we utilize quantitatively time and speedups in HITS and other algorithms. Briefly, we recall the following definitions obtained from [30] and [33]. Directed graph: The graph (V, E, o, t) is said to be directed if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph, G = (V, E, o, t), the edges e = (u, v), the origin of e is denoted by o, and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). Bipartite graph: The graph is called bipartite if V=V1⊎ V2 such that edges connect node V1 to V2. The expanding constant or isoperimetric constant (or Cheeger constant) of X is defined as: hX= min∅≠F⊂V∂FminF, V\\F (2) where F⊂V and the boundary ∂F is the set of edges connecting F to V∖F. The isoperimetric constant is difficult to compute, but we can bound its value using the spectral gap. The Spectral Gap is defined as the difference between the two highest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph. Sparse graphs: We say that a graph (or the corresponding network) is sparse if hX is large. One of the major results of Cheeger for Riemannian manifolds and its equivalent for graphs is that a large spectral gap implies large hX. Computing hX is an NP-Complete problem, while the computing spectral gap is at most cubic and many times linear; we work with the spectral gap here. Spectral gap: For a graph X, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as |λ1| ≥ |λ2| ≥ · · · ≥ |λn| (X may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The spectral gap is defined as: δλ = |λ1| − |λ2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of X, the eigenvalues are 1 = λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Lapacian spectral gap will be: δλ =1 − |λ2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ2 is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, λ2 = 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or Γ is bipartite), and a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence; the larger the spectral gap (the smaller |λ2|), the better the network flow (large hX, diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network X). Girth: The girth of X is the smallest positive integer r such that TraceAr>0. Let d=dX be the smallest integer (if it exists), so that for every pair of vertices u,v, there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then, dX is called the diameter or maximum eccentricity of the graph X. Clustering coefficient: The clustering coefficient models the degree of clustering of a subset of nodes. A node is selected, and we see how connected the node is with other nodes that are also connected to it. The clustering coefficient is defined by: Ci=LiKiKi−1/2 (3) where Li is the number of connections between Ki, which are the immediate neighbors of node i. The clustering coefficient is used to characterize network modularity, which is a strength of measure of a network division into modules or groups. Degree distribution: The degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of a node i is the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix: Ki=∑jaij (4) where the sum is over all the nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. For this case, the sum of the ith rows and ith columns of the adjacency matrix are: Kitotal=∑jaij+ ∑jaji (5) The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree kin and kout. Biomolecular networks such as GRNs follow preferential attachment models, which are scale-free with a degree distribution that follows an exponential law. Unlike the random graph model, these networks have nodes with large degrees, called hubs. Classically, with 0–1 (nonconnection-connection) networks, just the degree distribution is used in the identification of such hubs. A much more sophisticated algorithm is proposed by Kleinberg [34], called the HITS algorithm. Originally, it was meant for networks such as the Internet; however, now, it is used to study a variety of biomolecular networks, such as GRNs and Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks [35,36]. Most of these applications use PageRank to reveal localized information about the graph based on some form of external data. We apply this algorithm in our setting for the weighted and directed networks for the transcription factors-target gene networks and for co-expression networks. In the weighted GRN setting, the traditional simplistic method of detecting hub genes would not yield meaningful information. Our approach uses iteratively the weighted HITS algorithm in a novel way as follows. The weighted HITS algorithm computes the hub h→k (resp. authority a→k) nodes iteratively as: h→k= ψkϕk−1AATh→k−2 and a→k= ϕkψk−1ATAa→k−2. These iterations converge to the dominant eigenvector of the real symmetric matrices AAT (ATA). These give us asymptotically hub and authority weights. A version of this algorithm is implemented and applied to the networks in the software SAGE. Our algorithm gives weighted-hub genes and weighted-authority (target) genes. In complex networks, the HITS algorithm has very high complexity, and cannot be applied successfully. The spectral gap analysis shows that the graphs are sparse but highly connected, helping us carry out HITS with a high degree of iterations. The weighted HITS algorithm has yielded important information about biomolecular networks [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. For network topology, we refer to [46], and for the latest on the origin of biomolecular networks, topological, combinatorial, and spectral methods, we refer to [47].",

Two columns of 20,000 samples of gene expression values of Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col-0 root growth in spaceflight from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets are plotted in Figure 2 (A) and (B), respectively. X-axis is the first column of the gene expression values and y-axis is the second column of the gene expression values. The plot shows that the values are highly correlated. Hence, PCA is first applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data to three dimensions. The three PCA components are then used for computing Pearson correlation and generating the network, as explained in Section 2.2.2. All the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 spaceflight and ground data for Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth are used for generating the networks. In Table 1, sample correlation values between 13 genes, their t-statistics, and their p-values are given. Correlation values range from −1 to 1. P-values can also be used to construct GRNs by thresholding them between, for example, 0.01, and 0.0001, which will give the same network as a correlation threshold of 0.05. The threshold can be adjusted depending on the required level of complexity of the inferenced GRN. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show sub-graphs extracted from GLDS-7 root growth spaceflight and ground gene expression data, respectively, with a correlation threshold of 0.05. This threshold selects 11.3% of genes from the GLDS-7 dataset and 28.7% genes from the GLDS-120 dataset. These are weighted and directed sub-graphs extracted from the GLDS-7 spaceflight and ground GRNs, respectively. The weights are the correlation values (positive and negative) between the hub gene and the target gene, shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Negative interactions are important because they show an activation–inhibition two-way expression pattern. While positive correlations indicate shifting, scaling, or geometric pattern in gene expression data, negative correlations indicate opposite and complementary expression patterns, and self-negative regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Hence, we have extracted both maximal positive and negative correlations for constructing the GRNs. These gene interactions have not been validated by follow up experiments; however, they have been constructed from gene expression data obtained originally from experiments conducted in the ISS.

Figure 5A shows the number of shared genes for Arabidopsis WS and Col-0 ecotypes between GRNs for spaceflight and ground data for both light and dark environments, respectively. Figure 5B shows the number of shared genes for the Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD between GRNs for spaceflight and ground data for both light and dark environments, respectively. This helps us to make a secondary comparison between Col-0 ecotype with its mutant phyD and shows which hub genes are significantly represented in either case. Among the Arabidopsis ecotypes grown in spaceflight light environments, the GRN of Col-0 mutant phyD has 20 hub genes that are not shared with GRN of Col-0 ecotype grown in the same environment. The hub genes of Col-0 mutant phyD GRN overlap lesser with those of Col-0 than the overlap of the hub genes between WS and Col-0 GRNs in the light environment. The GRN of Col-0 mutant phyD in spaceflight light environment has the lowest number of shared hub genes. The phyD gene has a role in Red/Far-Red Light Sensing [48]. From our network analysis, we see that manipulation of a gene in an Arabidopsis ecotype can result in significantly different transcriptomic response that makes the biological organism to better adapt to the spaceflight environment [20]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams showing the number of shared hub genes from the gene regulatory networks for Arabidopsis thaliana. (A) Between the WS and Col-0 ecotypes in spaceflight and ground control for both total light and dark environments.

Figure 6 shows the Pearson correlation gene regulatory sub-graphs extracted from GRNs of the GLDS-120 dataset for the catabolic process for the Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth in spaceflight light environment. The number of hub genes in the GRN representation can be controlled by suitably adjusting the threshold value. The lower the threshold, larger number of hub genes can be detected and vice versa. In all our networks, we have used a nominal correlation threshold value of 0.05. The original networks have more than 600 genes involved in regulatory pathways. The GSEA of these hub genes present in spaceflight microgravity and ground control GRNs for WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD ecotypes grown in different light environments are presented below. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Gene regulatory sub-graph for the catabolic process in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 mutant phyD in spaceflight total light environment. The hub genes are the red circles representing the strong interactions with differentially expressed genes. The target (authority) genes are white circles. 3.1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) The hub genes, shared genes for spaceflight and ground environments, and their gene ontology from the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth datasets are given in Table 2. The ShinyGO tool (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/, accessed on 5 February 2021) is used to perform GSEA of the hub genes for the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth GRN. The hub genes for spaceflight microgravity and ground overlap considerably and are involved in molecular functions, biological processes, and oxidation-reduction process. They enable NADH dehydrogenase activity, and are involved in NAD and quinone binding. Contrary to GLDS-7 GRN functions, the GRNs constructed for the Arabidopsis WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD show significantly different regulations in spaceflight in total light. These GRNs do share genes with ground control GRNs, but have other genes that show significant transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity, and these genes are not shared by the ground GRNs. Hence, these genes can be considered to be affected by spaceflight microgravity alone. These genes are related to biological processes such as DNA integration, the RNA-dependent DNA biosynthetic process, and the DNA metabolic process. We performed a GSEA analysis comparing hub genes for the WS wild ecotype and Col-0 ecotype. The hub genes for the WS ecotype are associated with biological processes such as the catabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, localization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The hub genes for the Col-0 ecotype perform similar functions to WS ecotype such as the catabolic process, regulation of metabolic process, positive regulation of biological process, cellular response to stimulus, signaling, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The shared hub genes between the Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD perform functions such as regulation of metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, positive regulation of biological process, anatomical structure development, and catabolic process. The non-shared hub genes of phyD in spaceflight microgravity perform significant functions such as the cellular component organization of biogenesis, response to abiotic stress, and response to external stimulus.

GSEA for Common Hub Genes Eight common hub genes between the spaceflight and ground environments have been identified, as shown in Table 2. Using g:Profiler, we found that these genes, including the gene ATMG00600 (ORF 106C), are uncharacterized mitochondrial protein and their function is DNA integration. AT1G04080 is a shared gene between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes, which encodes a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factor involved in alternative splicing. AT1G02930 and AT1G04980 are the shared genes between the Col-0 and Col-0 mutant phyD, which are involved in the defense response to bacterium, glutathione metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, response to oxidative stress, water deprivation, heat, response to unfolded protein, and ubiquitin pathway. The Pearson and LASSO methods have led to the identification of signature sub-networks that show the interaction across several important metabolic and signaling processes, and Transcription Factors (TFs) for Arabidopsis growth in spaceflight microgravity. Both methods were able to identify the transcription factors AT1G06040, AT1G01720, and AT1G04850. AT1G06040 encodes salt tolerance protein and AT1G01720 is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and has a DNA binding TF activity. The TF AT1G04850 is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA)/TS-N domain-containing protein, and its function is zinc ion binding. From the GRNs, we can identify genes with the maximum degree (hub genes) that regulate a larger number of authority (target) genes. 3.1.2. Gene Ontology of Transcription Factors (Genes) in Spaceflight Thirty-eight hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight have been identified from the total light environment gene expression datasets of GLDS-120. Their ATG number, gene name, and gene ontology are presented in Supplementary Table S1. These are hub genes, as their transcriptional responses are abundant only in spaceflight microgravity network and are not found to be hub genes in the corresponding terrestrial GRNs. Hence, these genes are functioning only in spaceflight microgravity conditions. From their ontology, it is evident that they are responsible for important functions necessary for the plant’s growth in an altered environmental setup compared to the terrestrial environment. The plant can sense the changes in abiotic stressors such as gravity, oxygen, and radiation and can step up transcriptional regulation to adapt to the new environment successfully. The transcription functions of these genes are chiefly cell wall biosynthesis, protein transport, stress responses, catabolic processes, auxin, and protein regulation. It is also significant that these genes were identifiable only from the GLDS-120 dataset, which had a different lighting environment in spaceflight. Through novel graph theoretic methods applied to GRNs of Arabidopsis, we can explain phenomenological traits that have been observed in spaceflight vis-à-vis on the ground. 3.2. Topological and Spectral Analyses of Gene Regulatory Networks Topological and algebraic analyses of the GRNs are given in Table 3. The WS ecotype in total light spaceflight environment has the largest spectral gap, which indicates that this network has the highest performance with stable synchronization, rapid convergence, mixing, expansion, and diffusion [47]. Random walks propagate more easily in networks with a large spectral gap. The large spectral gap has also made several algorithms we use tractable for such massively large GRN and indicates that in technical terms, these GRNs are highly sparse. This corroborates with results from other studies that have shown that the WS genotype increases the transcriptional cost of spaceflight adaptation [20]. The diameter of this network is 6, indicating that it has longer gene signaling pathways, and the hub genes of this network regulate about 1000 target genes. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes in the ground light environment show topological similarities with the same shortest path length, and the two networks show regulation of about 45 target genes. Table 3.

Rather than just the degree distribution, hubs and authority nodes are computed iteratively with newer algorithms considering weights using its implementation in the software SAGEMATH. Improved algorithms exist, e.g., [35], and some of Kleinberg’s works. 3.3. Arabidopsis Root Growth and Cell Wall Biosynthesis in Spaceflight Microgravity Out of the 33 root-growth related genes of Arabidopsis, we have identified five significant hub genes listed in Table 4 to have higher regulations in spaceflight. Figure 7 shows the subgraph that is extracted from the original Pearson correlation GRN by thresholding the genes with higher correlation values and involved in the cell wall biosynthesis metabolic process that relates the co-expression of these genes in spaceflight microgravity for the Arabidopsis Col mutant phyD ecotype. These five hub genes have higher regulations only in the spaceflight subgraph for the cell wall response process and not in the ground subgraph. These genes are over-represented in the spaceflight responsive transcriptome because they regulate plant growth in spaceflight microgravity and enable adaptation of the plant to the altered environment. Similarly, comparing the GRNs generated by the LASSO method for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight and ground environments, the hub genes that are involved only in spaceflight for cell wall biosynthesis have been identified and listed in Supplementary Table S2. Figure 8 shows the subgraph for the cell wall biosynthesis process for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight microgravity, which is also extracted similarly by thresholding the correlation values. These genes encode NSEs and have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight, as they were not found to be hubs in the GRNs for the terrestrial datasets. These enzymes catalyze a series of biochemical reactions and are involved in building cell wall polysaccharides. The origin and divergence of these enzymes is not known, and it is interesting to note that they are significantly transcribed indicative of higher sugar diversity in spaceflight microgravity. The higher regulations of these genes may be the reason for the phenotypic skewing or waving effect found in the roots, as well as other parts of the plant in spaceflight. The differential transcriptions of NSEs indicate that they regulate developmental, metabolic, and stress-related responses in the spaceflight microgravity environment. Table 4.

Two columns of 20,000 samples of gene expression values of Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col-0 root growth in spaceflight from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets are plotted in Figure 2 (A) and (B), respectively. X-axis is the first column of the gene expression values and y-axis is the second column of the gene expression values. The plot shows that the values are highly correlated. Hence, PCA is first applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data to three dimensions. The three PCA components are then used for computing Pearson correlation and generating the network, as explained in Section 2.2.2. All the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 spaceflight and ground data for Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth are used for generating the networks. In Table 1, sample correlation values between 13 genes, their t-statistics, and their p-values are given. Correlation values range from −1 to 1. P-values can also be used to construct GRNs by thresholding them between, for example, 0.01, and 0.0001, which will give the same network as a correlation threshold of 0.05. The threshold can be adjusted depending on the required level of complexity of the inferenced GRN. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show sub-graphs extracted from GLDS-7 root growth spaceflight and ground gene expression data, respectively, with a correlation threshold of 0.05. This threshold selects 11.3% of genes from the GLDS-7 dataset and 28.7% genes from the GLDS-120 dataset. These are weighted and directed sub-graphs extracted from the GLDS-7 spaceflight and ground GRNs, respectively. The weights are the correlation values (positive and negative) between the hub gene and the target gene, shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Negative interactions are important because they show an activation–inhibition two-way expression pattern. While positive correlations indicate shifting, scaling, or geometric pattern in gene expression data, negative correlations indicate opposite and complementary expression patterns, and self-negative regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Hence, we have extracted both maximal positive and negative correlations for constructing the GRNs. These gene interactions have not been validated by follow up experiments; however, they have been constructed from gene expression data obtained originally from experiments conducted in the ISS.

The number of hub genes in the GRN representation can be controlled by suitably adjusting the threshold value. The lower the threshold, larger number of hub genes can be detected and vice versa. In all our networks, we have used a nominal correlation threshold value of 0.05. The original networks have more than 600 genes involved in regulatory pathways. The GSEA of these hub genes present in spaceflight microgravity and ground control GRNs for WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD ecotypes grown in different light environments are presented below.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) The hub genes, shared genes for spaceflight and ground environments, and their gene ontology from the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth datasets are given in Table 2. The ShinyGO tool (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/, accessed on 5 February 2021) is used to perform GSEA of the hub genes for the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth GRN. The hub genes for spaceflight microgravity and ground overlap considerably and are involved in molecular functions, biological processes, and oxidation-reduction process. They enable NADH dehydrogenase activity, and are involved in NAD and quinone binding. Contrary to GLDS-7 GRN functions, the GRNs constructed for the Arabidopsis WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD show significantly different regulations in spaceflight in total light. These GRNs do share genes with ground control GRNs, but have other genes that show significant transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity, and these genes are not shared by the ground GRNs. Hence, these genes can be considered to be affected by spaceflight microgravity alone. These genes are related to biological processes such as DNA integration, the RNA-dependent DNA biosynthetic process, and the DNA metabolic process. We performed a GSEA analysis comparing hub genes for the WS wild ecotype and Col-0 ecotype. The hub genes for the WS ecotype are associated with biological processes such as the catabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, localization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The hub genes for the Col-0 ecotype perform similar functions to WS ecotype such as the catabolic process, regulation of metabolic process, positive regulation of biological process, cellular response to stimulus, signaling, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The shared hub genes between the Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD perform functions such as regulation of metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, positive regulation of biological process, anatomical structure development, and catabolic process. The non-shared hub genes of phyD in spaceflight microgravity perform significant functions such as the cellular component organization of biogenesis, response to abiotic stress, and response to external stimulus.

GSEA for Common Hub Genes Eight common hub genes between the spaceflight and ground environments have been identified, as shown in Table 2. Using g:Profiler, we found that these genes, including the gene ATMG00600 (ORF 106C), are uncharacterized mitochondrial protein and their function is DNA integration. AT1G04080 is a shared gene between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes, which encodes a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factor involved in alternative splicing. AT1G02930 and AT1G04980 are the shared genes between the Col-0 and Col-0 mutant phyD, which are involved in the defense response to bacterium, glutathione metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, response to oxidative stress, water deprivation, heat, response to unfolded protein, and ubiquitin pathway. The Pearson and LASSO methods have led to the identification of signature sub-networks that show the interaction across several important metabolic and signaling processes, and Transcription Factors (TFs) for Arabidopsis growth in spaceflight microgravity. Both methods were able to identify the transcription factors AT1G06040, AT1G01720, and AT1G04850. AT1G06040 encodes salt tolerance protein and AT1G01720 is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and has a DNA binding TF activity. The TF AT1G04850 is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA)/TS-N domain-containing protein, and its function is zinc ion binding. From the GRNs, we can identify genes with the maximum degree (hub genes) that regulate a larger number of authority (target) genes. 3.1.2. Gene Ontology of Transcription Factors (Genes) in Spaceflight Thirty-eight hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight have been identified from the total light environment gene expression datasets of GLDS-120. Their ATG number, gene name, and gene ontology are presented in Supplementary Table S1. These are hub genes, as their transcriptional responses are abundant only in spaceflight microgravity network and are not found to be hub genes in the corresponding terrestrial GRNs. Hence, these genes are functioning only in spaceflight microgravity conditions. From their ontology, it is evident that they are responsible for important functions necessary for the plant’s growth in an altered environmental setup compared to the terrestrial environment. The plant can sense the changes in abiotic stressors such as gravity, oxygen, and radiation and can step up transcriptional regulation to adapt to the new environment successfully. The transcription functions of these genes are chiefly cell wall biosynthesis, protein transport, stress responses, catabolic processes, auxin, and protein regulation. It is also significant that these genes were identifiable only from the GLDS-120 dataset, which had a different lighting environment in spaceflight. Through novel graph theoretic methods applied to GRNs of Arabidopsis, we can explain phenomenological traits that have been observed in spaceflight vis-à-vis on the ground. 3.2. Topological and Spectral Analyses of Gene Regulatory Networks Topological and algebraic analyses of the GRNs are given in Table 3. The WS ecotype in total light spaceflight environment has the largest spectral gap, which indicates that this network has the highest performance with stable synchronization, rapid convergence, mixing, expansion, and diffusion [47]. Random walks propagate more easily in networks with a large spectral gap. The large spectral gap has also made several algorithms we use tractable for such massively large GRN and indicates that in technical terms, these GRNs are highly sparse. This corroborates with results from other studies that have shown that the WS genotype increases the transcriptional cost of spaceflight adaptation [20]. The diameter of this network is 6, indicating that it has longer gene signaling pathways, and the hub genes of this network regulate about 1000 target genes. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes in the ground light environment show topological similarities with the same shortest path length, and the two networks show regulation of about 45 target genes. Table 3.

Rather than just the degree distribution, hubs and authority nodes are computed iteratively with newer algorithms considering weights using its implementation in the software SAGEMATH. Improved algorithms exist, e.g., [35], and some of Kleinberg’s works. 3.3. Arabidopsis Root Growth and Cell Wall Biosynthesis in Spaceflight Microgravity Out of the 33 root-growth related genes of Arabidopsis, we have identified five significant hub genes listed in Table 4 to have higher regulations in spaceflight. Figure 7 shows the subgraph that is extracted from the original Pearson correlation GRN by thresholding the genes with higher correlation values and involved in the cell wall biosynthesis metabolic process that relates the co-expression of these genes in spaceflight microgravity for the Arabidopsis Col mutant phyD ecotype. These five hub genes have higher regulations only in the spaceflight subgraph for the cell wall response process and not in the ground subgraph. These genes are over-represented in the spaceflight responsive transcriptome because they regulate plant growth in spaceflight microgravity and enable adaptation of the plant to the altered environment. Similarly, comparing the GRNs generated by the LASSO method for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight and ground environments, the hub genes that are involved only in spaceflight for cell wall biosynthesis have been identified and listed in Supplementary Table S2. Figure 8 shows the subgraph for the cell wall biosynthesis process for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight microgravity, which is also extracted similarly by thresholding the correlation values. These genes encode NSEs and have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight, as they were not found to be hubs in the GRNs for the terrestrial datasets. These enzymes catalyze a series of biochemical reactions and are involved in building cell wall polysaccharides. The origin and divergence of these enzymes is not known, and it is interesting to note that they are significantly transcribed indicative of higher sugar diversity in spaceflight microgravity. The higher regulations of these genes may be the reason for the phenotypic skewing or waving effect found in the roots, as well as other parts of the plant in spaceflight. The differential transcriptions of NSEs indicate that they regulate developmental, metabolic, and stress-related responses in the spaceflight microgravity environment. Table 4.

    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions Graph-based network analysis methods and results have been presented for transcriptomic regulatory GeneLab Arabidopsis datasets. Previous studies were at the transcriptomic level. In this article, we have built gene regulatory networks for different ecotypes (via Pearson Correlation and LASSO methods), carried out both topological and algebraic network studies (the novel HITS algorithm for weighted and directed graphs to identify hubs and authority nodes), computed the spectral gap for the whole GRN, leading us to potential conclusions about phenomena such as diffusion and expansion of the GRN, and studied global and local topological parameters, such as clustering, average path length, eccentricity, and degree distribution. Therefore, our research is more complementary to prior studies and is more rigorous. Our novel graph-theoretic approach isolated hub genes regulated significantly different in spaceflight microgravity from terrestrial gene expressions. The GRN for the WS ecotype in spaceflight has the highest spectral gap, indicating that it has the highest transcriptional cost in spaceflight. GRN analysis showed that there are 38 genes with higher transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in vital molecular and biological functions for the survival and growth of the plant in spaceflight. While previous research has identified altered spaceflight transcriptions for cell wall remodeling, we have identified hub genes with higher transcriptional activity and that are involved in the cell wall response process only in spaceflight GRN; these hub genes are essentially metabolic phenotypes. The network analysis has detected xyloglucan endo-trans glycosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) that are cell wall modifying enzymes mediating vital elongation growth of Arabidopsis in spaceflight. The XTHs act on the cell wall, making it more extensible, resulting in cellular expansion and the skewing phenomenon of the roots in spaceflight microgravity. Through advanced network analysis, we can shorten the gap between genotype to phenotype analysis by identifying primary metabolites or metabolic phenotypes involved in the growth of plants in spaceflight for bioregenerative life support. In the absence of mass spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging methods in the ISS, and lack of plant physiological measurements, genome to phenome network analysis offers an alternative for identifying primary metabolic phenotypes. The spaceflight response of these metabolites can be further correlated with phenotypic data extracted from images and metabolomics datasets acquired from experiments conducted in the ISS or from similar experiments on the ground. Phenotypic data will enable novel trait correlations employing genome to phenome network analysis.",

Copyright notice ID: 7996555 PMID: 33668919 Abstract The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD (phyD) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis. Keywords: gene expression, graphs, network analysis, root growth, cell wall biosynthesis, spaceflight microgravity, Arabidopsis thaliana1. Introduction Gravity plays a key role in plant growth [1]. Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a flowering plant that has been chosen by biologists as a model plant organism to study the effects of gravity and other environmental stressors, since it has a short life cycle and because of the existence of a multitude of mutants and transgenic plants. The current visibility of Arabidopsis research reflects the growing realization among biologists that this simple angiosperm can serve as a convenient model not only for plant biology but also for addressing fundamental questions of biological structure and function common to all Eukaryotes [2]. To achieve the goal of providing long term life support for deep space missions a fundamental knowledge on plant growth in spaceflight has to be gained. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently equipped with all capabilities to collect data needed to address fundamental questions of plant physiology and development in spaceflight microgravity [3]. In this article, we are interested in identifying the genes that show transcriptional abundance under the influence of spaceflight microgravity, and the genes primarily influencing root growth and cell wall biosynthesis in spaceflight. The transcriptomic profile of Arabidopsis has been studied in simulated microgravity [4]. The effect of gravity and mechanical stimulation on the growth of the root apex of Arabidopsis has resulted in transient changes in gene expressions [5]. The effect of spaceflight microgravity on Arabidopsis root growth is presented in [6]. Cell wall modeling in the roots, shoots, and hypocotyls of plants is an important metabolic adaptation brought about by genes and proteins. Metabolic phenotyping of Arabidopsis has been carried out on the ground [7]. Metabolic fingerprinting is important for improving the quality of crops grown in spaceflight. Several of the cell wall proteome changes have been corroborated with transcriptomic changes in spaceflight [8]. As plants are important for the bioregenerative life support in spaceflight, the cell wall perturbations may affect the yield of crops grown in the altered spaceflight environment [9]. Of the 33 XTH Arabidopsis root growth genes, XTH17 to XTH20 are the main contributors [10]. Nucleotide sugar interconversions in plants are discussed in [11,12]. From terrestrial studies, nucleotide-diphsopho-(NPD) sugar interconversion enzymes (NSE) of the small dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily are given in [13]. Plant Cell Wall (PCW) genes were identified using gene co-expression analysis in [14], and it was shown how these genes are transcriptionally co-regulated [15]. These sugars require subtle quantitative control during plant root growth and development. Hence, it is important to identify the genes that encode these enzymes involved in regulating growth of adventitious roots, and their waving and skewing in spaceflight microgravity. Researchers have used various ecotypes and mutants of Arabidopsis to isolate genes with transcriptional variation in spaceflight environment compared to on the ground. Since we are not doing the experiment and performing the data collection, we rely on datasets available from GeneLab for plants grown in spaceflight microgravity. GeneLab provides transcriptomic datasets for various ecotypes of Arabidopsis from spaceflight. The Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0 showed differential gene expression due to oxidative stress in spaceflight [16]. Differential gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis exposed over six days to blue light at different levels of gravity in comparison to unit gravity control has been presented in [17], and it was found that blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce stress due to lower levels of gravity in spaceflight. It was found that plants in spaceflight microgravity grow slower than plants in unit gravity on the ground. Two ecotypes of Arabidopsis (WS and Col-0) were grown in spaceflight under directional light, and it was found that skewing and waving of roots were independent of gravity, the roots were negatively phototropic, and both ecotypes skewed differently in the presence of light, due to a lack of gravity [18]. Major organ-specific and cellular remodeling of Arabidopsis has been identified from its growth in ISS and physiological adaptation to spaceflight [3,19]. Previous literature, cited above, characterized unique transcriptions in WS, Col-0, and PhyD mutant of Arabidopsis using heat maps and fold change analysis methods. For all the genome analysis done, no phenotypic measurements have been presented or discussed. However, the gradient-light experiments conducted in the ISS resulted in the plant root growth in a skewing pattern. These were dramatic observations of phenotype changes concerning root growth and cell wall response in microgravity. Hence, we have chosen the GLDS-7 [3] and GLDS-120 [20] datasets collected under different lighting settings for applying our network analysis methods. The biochemical interactions within a cell of a biological system are formulated as gene regulatory networks for modeling biological processes. GRNs are used to represent regulatory and transcriptional functions that underlie cellular, molecular, and biological phenomena. GRNs have become an indispensable tool that facilitates interpretation of biological processes, molecular functions, protein interactions, genome to phenome analysis, cellular differentiation, identification of genes as biomarkers, and the response of an organism to external stimuli. A Bayesian network generation method for GRN constructed for Arabidopsis has been presented [21]. Several machine learning algorithms have been implemented for the generation of these networks [22]. In [23], several statistical and machine learning methods have been reviewed for the prediction of GRNs from transcriptome datasets. In [24], many algorithms for GRN inferencing from single-cell transcriptomic data are benchmarked using simulated data. Several GRNs have been generated to study root development in Arabidopsis [25]. Vascular root development has been represented using GRNs in [26]. Furthermore, Arabidopsis secondary cell wall synthesis has been studied using a protein-DNA regulatory network and genes involved in secondary cell wall modeling, which form the cell shape and the bulk of the plant biomass [27]. Other GRNs for Arabidopsis growth and development are presented in [28]. Gene Ontology is the process of classifying an annotated gene to a particular function. Gene set enrichment analysis is used to determine changes of expression in groups of a priori defined gene sets. Additional web-tools and databases are available for Arabidopsis gene expression analysis [29]. These GRN studies do not identify hub genes and the target (authority) genes they regulate in spaceflight microgravity compared to on the ground for important biological processes that are affected in spaceflight, nor perform rigorous graph theoretic network analysis and derive biological interpretations. We have used three basic graph-based network approaches in this paper (1) the LASSO, (2) Pearson correlation, and (3) HITS methods. LASSO and Pearson correlation methods are applied to construct GRNs of transcriptional regulations in spaceflight microgravity as well as ground control. Section 2 presents the materials and methods used for GRN inferencing and analysis. In Section 3, we present the results of the GRN analysis of the significant hub genes (identified from Pearson and HITS method) with the highest transcriptional abundance in spaceflight microgravity. Results from network analysis of the Arabidopsis ecotypes and genotype are discussed in this section. The root growth and cell wall genes affected in spaceflight microgravity are isolated and their molecular functions are discussed. Section 4 presents the conclusions.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. GeneLab Arabidopsis Datasets We have mined GeneLab GLDS-7 and GLDS -120 datasets for identifying hub genes that are affected by spaceflight. The GLDS-7 dataset contains microarray gene expression data for the Arabidopsis WS and Col-0 ecotypes for different tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) for the plants grown in ground control and spaceflight in white light. GLDS-120 contains the transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) ecotypes, and the gene Phytochrome D (phyD) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are 4–6 umoles m-2 s-1 of total light and dark in spaceflight and on the ground. The design of the experiment was to investigate the effect of light on Arabidopsis root growth when the gravity stimuli were nullified. The phyD mutant was used, since it is a known light-related mutant in Col-0 background. RNAseq is used for transcription profiling. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes. 2.2. Graph-Based GRN Inferencing We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G = (V, E) where V is the vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and E is an ordered pair of vertices (u, v) that are called the edges (arcs), respectively [30]. One important advantage of the representation of networks by graphs is that they have an intuitive graphical representation. In a directed graph G = (V, E, o, t), e = (u, v) are the edges, the origin of e is denoted by o(e), and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a positive real-valued weight w(e). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is applied to de-correlate the gene expression values. PCA is done to reduce the dimensions to three main components corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix computed from the graph representation of the gene expression data. PCA projects the data on to an orthogonal space, such that the variance of the projected data is maximized. This space is lower in dimension with minimum projection cost. PCA is applied to the gene expression datasets before performing both LASSO regression and Pearson correlation GRN construction. 2.2.1. LASSO Regression Lasso is a linear regression algorithm that shrinks the data towards a central point. Lasso regression mostly leads to sparse models. Lasso uses the l1 regularization, which means it adds a penalty that is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients. Lasso regression is computationally feasible and can fit any kind of statistical data [31]. l1 regularization is applied to eliminate the relationship between the genes with the least importance. The Lasso regression is constructed according to the description in [31]. We have used the SILGGM package in R for the Lasso Regression [32]. In this algorithm, every gene present in the data is considered as a transcription factor, as well as a target gene, and the correlation between each gene with the other is calculated using the scaled Lasso algorithm. The results from the regression are used to construct GRNs in Cytoscape for the sub-modules of the genes of Arabidopsis spaceflight and ground datasets. The method has been applied to the GeneLab GLDS-120 dataset.2.2.2. Pearson Correlation Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two genes (variables, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations: ρX,Y=cov(X,Y)σXσY (1) Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two random variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not specifically identified. In this study, we use the Pearson correlation to construct the co-expressed gene network to identify genes with correlated expression patterns. This method is based on an adjusted threshold p-value to accommodate multiple hypotheses; the correlation between expression patterns is calculated for every pair of genes. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered to be co-expressed if their p-value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold p-value. The t-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and hence, that there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the nodes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intra-module (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks. Figure 1 shows the steps involved in generating the GRN from the microarray gene expression dataset using this method. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Flow chart of the procedure for gene regulatory network inferencing using the graph-based Pearson correlation method.2.2.3. Sparse Networks and the Weighted HITS Algorithm We show that the GRN generated for the GeneLab Arabidopsis datasets are sparse networks or graphs. We define sparsity precisely so that we utilize quantitatively time and speedups in HITS and other algorithms. Briefly, we recall the following definitions obtained from [30] and [33]. Directed graph: The graph (V, E, o, t) is said to be directed if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph, G = (V, E, o, t), the edges e = (u, v), the origin of e is denoted by o, and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). Bipartite graph: The graph is called bipartite if V=V1⊎ V2 such that edges connect node V1 to V2. The expanding constant or isoperimetric constant (or Cheeger constant) of X is defined as: hX= min∅≠F⊂V∂FminF, V\\F (2) where F⊂V and the boundary ∂F is the set of edges connecting F to V∖F. The isoperimetric constant is difficult to compute, but we can bound its value using the spectral gap. The Spectral Gap is defined as the difference between the two highest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph. Sparse graphs: We say that a graph (or the corresponding network) is sparse if hX is large. One of the major results of Cheeger for Riemannian manifolds and its equivalent for graphs is that a large spectral gap implies large hX. Computing hX is an NP-Complete problem, while the computing spectral gap is at most cubic and many times linear; we work with the spectral gap here. Spectral gap: For a graph X, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as |λ1| ≥ |λ2| ≥ · · · ≥ |λn| (X may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The spectral gap is defined as: δλ = |λ1| − |λ2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of X, the eigenvalues are 1 = λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Lapacian spectral gap will be: δλ =1 − |λ2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ2 is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, λ2 = 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or Γ is bipartite), and a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence; the larger the spectral gap (the smaller |λ2|), the better the network flow (large hX, diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network X). Girth: The girth of X is the smallest positive integer r such that TraceAr>0. Let d=dX be the smallest integer (if it exists), so that for every pair of vertices u,v, there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then, dX is called the diameter or maximum eccentricity of the graph X. Clustering coefficient: The clustering coefficient models the degree of clustering of a subset of nodes. A node is selected, and we see how connected the node is with other nodes that are also connected to it. The clustering coefficient is defined by: Ci=LiKiKi−1/2 (3) where Li is the number of connections between Ki, which are the immediate neighbors of node i. The clustering coefficient is used to characterize network modularity, which is a strength of measure of a network division into modules or groups. Degree distribution: The degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of a node i is the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix: Ki=∑jaij (4) where the sum is over all the nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. For this case, the sum of the ith rows and ith columns of the adjacency matrix are: Kitotal=∑jaij+ ∑jaji (5) The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree kin and kout. Biomolecular networks such as GRNs follow preferential attachment models, which are scale-free with a degree distribution that follows an exponential law. Unlike the random graph model, these networks have nodes with large degrees, called hubs. Classically, with 0–1 (nonconnection-connection) networks, just the degree distribution is used in the identification of such hubs. A much more sophisticated algorithm is proposed by Kleinberg [34], called the HITS algorithm. Originally, it was meant for networks such as the Internet; however, now, it is used to study a variety of biomolecular networks, such as GRNs and Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks [35,36]. Most of these applications use PageRank to reveal localized information about the graph based on some form of external data. We apply this algorithm in our setting for the weighted and directed networks for the transcription factors-target gene networks and for co-expression networks. In the weighted GRN setting, the traditional simplistic method of detecting hub genes would not yield meaningful information. Our approach uses iteratively the weighted HITS algorithm in a novel way as follows. The weighted HITS algorithm computes the hub h→k (resp. authority a→k) nodes iteratively as: h→k= ψkϕk−1AATh→k−2 and a→k= ϕkψk−1ATAa→k−2. These iterations converge to the dominant eigenvector of the real symmetric matrices AAT (ATA). These give us asymptotically hub and authority weights. A version of this algorithm is implemented and applied to the networks in the software SAGE. Our algorithm gives weighted-hub genes and weighted-authority (target) genes. In complex networks, the HITS algorithm has very high complexity, and cannot be applied successfully. The spectral gap analysis shows that the graphs are sparse but highly connected, helping us carry out HITS with a high degree of iterations. The weighted HITS algorithm has yielded important information about biomolecular networks [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. For network topology, we refer to [46], and for the latest on the origin of biomolecular networks, topological, combinatorial, and spectral methods, we refer to [47]. 3. Results and Discussion The Pearson correlation method is used to generate weighted directed graphs. Two columns of 20,000 samples of gene expression values of Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col-0 root growth in spaceflight from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets are plotted in Figure 2 (A) and (B), respectively. X-axis is the first column of the gene expression values and y-axis is the second column of the gene expression values. The plot shows that the values are highly correlated. Hence, PCA is first applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data to three dimensions. The three PCA components are then used for computing Pearson correlation and generating the network, as explained in Section 2.2.2. All the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 spaceflight and ground data for Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth are used for generating the networks. In Table 1, sample correlation values between 13 genes, their t-statistics, and their p-values are given. Correlation values range from −1 to 1. P-values can also be used to construct GRNs by thresholding them between, for example, 0.01, and 0.0001, which will give the same network as a correlation threshold of 0.05. The threshold can be adjusted depending on the required level of complexity of the inferenced GRN. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show sub-graphs extracted from GLDS-7 root growth spaceflight and ground gene expression data, respectively, with a correlation threshold of 0.05. This threshold selects 11.3% of genes from the GLDS-7 dataset and 28.7% genes from the GLDS-120 dataset. These are weighted and directed sub-graphs extracted from the GLDS-7 spaceflight and ground GRNs, respectively. The weights are the correlation values (positive and negative) between the hub gene and the target gene, shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Negative interactions are important because they show an activation–inhibition two-way expression pattern. While positive correlations indicate shifting, scaling, or geometric pattern in gene expression data, negative correlations indicate opposite and complementary expression patterns, and self-negative regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Hence, we have extracted both maximal positive and negative correlations for constructing the GRNs. These gene interactions have not been validated by follow up experiments; however, they have been constructed from gene expression data obtained originally from experiments conducted in the ISS.

Figure 5B shows the number of shared genes for the Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD between GRNs for spaceflight and ground data for both light and dark environments, respectively. This helps us to make a secondary comparison between Col-0 ecotype with its mutant phyD and shows which hub genes are significantly represented in either case. Among the Arabidopsis ecotypes grown in spaceflight light environments, the GRN of Col-0 mutant phyD has 20 hub genes that are not shared with GRN of Col-0 ecotype grown in the same environment. The hub genes of Col-0 mutant phyD GRN overlap lesser with those of Col-0 than the overlap of the hub genes between WS and Col-0 GRNs in the light environment. The GRN of Col-0 mutant phyD in spaceflight light environment has the lowest number of shared hub genes. The phyD gene has a role in Red/Far-Red Light Sensing [48]. From our network analysis, we see that manipulation of a gene in an Arabidopsis ecotype can result in significantly different transcriptomic response that makes the biological organism to better adapt to the spaceflight environment [20]. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams showing the number of shared hub genes from the gene regulatory networks for Arabidopsis thaliana. (A) Between the WS and Col-0 ecotypes in spaceflight and ground control for both total light and dark environments. (B) Between Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD in spaceflight and ground control for both total light and dark environments.Figure 6 shows the Pearson correlation gene regulatory sub-graphs extracted from GRNs of the GLDS-120 dataset for the catabolic process for the Arabidopsis WS ecotype root growth in spaceflight light environment. The number of hub genes in the GRN representation can be controlled by suitably adjusting the threshold value. The lower the threshold, larger number of hub genes can be detected and vice versa. In all our networks, we have used a nominal correlation threshold value of 0.05. The original networks have more than 600 genes involved in regulatory pathways. The GSEA of these hub genes present in spaceflight microgravity and ground control GRNs for WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD ecotypes grown in different light environments are presented below. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Gene regulatory sub-graph for the catabolic process in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 mutant phyD in spaceflight total light environment. The hub genes are the red circles representing the strong interactions with differentially expressed genes. The target (authority) genes are white circles.3.1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) The hub genes, shared genes for spaceflight and ground environments, and their gene ontology from the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth datasets are given in Table 2. The ShinyGO tool (http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/, accessed on 5 February 2021) is used to perform GSEA of the hub genes for the GeneLab GLDS-7 root growth GRN. The hub genes for spaceflight microgravity and ground overlap considerably and are involved in molecular functions, biological processes, and oxidation-reduction process. They enable NADH dehydrogenase activity, and are involved in NAD and quinone binding. Contrary to GLDS-7 GRN functions, the GRNs constructed for the Arabidopsis WS, Col-0, and Col mutant phyD show significantly different regulations in spaceflight in total light. These GRNs do share genes with ground control GRNs, but have other genes that show significant transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity, and these genes are not shared by the ground GRNs. Hence, these genes can be considered to be affected by spaceflight microgravity alone. These genes are related to biological processes such as DNA integration, the RNA-dependent DNA biosynthetic process, and the DNA metabolic process. We performed a GSEA analysis comparing hub genes for the WS wild ecotype and Col-0 ecotype. The hub genes for the WS ecotype are associated with biological processes such as the catabolic process, response to abiotic stimulus, localization, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The hub genes for the Col-0 ecotype perform similar functions to WS ecotype such as the catabolic process, regulation of metabolic process, positive regulation of biological process, cellular response to stimulus, signaling, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, and anatomical structure development. The shared hub genes between the Col-0 ecotype and Col-0 mutant phyD perform functions such as regulation of metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, developmental process, positive regulation of biological process, anatomical structure development, and catabolic process. The non-shared hub genes of phyD in spaceflight microgravity perform significant functions such as the cellular component organization of biogenesis, response to abiotic stress, and response to external stimulus.

GSEA for Common Hub Genes Eight common hub genes between the spaceflight and ground environments have been identified, as shown in Table 2. Using g:Profiler, we found that these genes, including the gene ATMG00600 (ORF 106C), are uncharacterized mitochondrial protein and their function is DNA integration. AT1G04080 is a shared gene between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes, which encodes a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) factor involved in alternative splicing. AT1G02930 and AT1G04980 are the shared genes between the Col-0 and Col-0 mutant phyD, which are involved in the defense response to bacterium, glutathione metabolic process, response to cadmium ion, response to oxidative stress, water deprivation, heat, response to unfolded protein, and ubiquitin pathway. The Pearson and LASSO methods have led to the identification of signature sub-networks that show the interaction across several important metabolic and signaling processes, and Transcription Factors (TFs) for Arabidopsis growth in spaceflight microgravity. Both methods were able to identify the transcription factors AT1G06040, AT1G01720, and AT1G04850. AT1G06040 encodes salt tolerance protein and AT1G01720 is involved in the cellular response to hypoxia and has a DNA binding TF activity. The TF AT1G04850 is a ubiquitin-associated (UBA)/TS-N domain-containing protein, and its function is zinc ion binding. From the GRNs, we can identify genes with the maximum degree (hub genes) that regulate a larger number of authority (target) genes. 3.1.2. Gene Ontology of Transcription Factors (Genes) in Spaceflight Thirty-eight hub genes with transcriptional abundance in spaceflight have been identified from the total light environment gene expression datasets of GLDS-120. Their ATG number, gene name, and gene ontology are presented in Supplementary Table S1. These are hub genes, as their transcriptional responses are abundant only in spaceflight microgravity network and are not found to be hub genes in the corresponding terrestrial GRNs. Hence, these genes are functioning only in spaceflight microgravity conditions. From their ontology, it is evident that they are responsible for important functions necessary for the plant’s growth in an altered environmental setup compared to the terrestrial environment. The plant can sense the changes in abiotic stressors such as gravity, oxygen, and radiation and can step up transcriptional regulation to adapt to the new environment successfully. The transcription functions of these genes are chiefly cell wall biosynthesis, protein transport, stress responses, catabolic processes, auxin, and protein regulation. It is also significant that these genes were identifiable only from the GLDS-120 dataset, which had a different lighting environment in spaceflight. Through novel graph theoretic methods applied to GRNs of Arabidopsis, we can explain phenomenological traits that have been observed in spaceflight vis-à-vis on the ground. 3.2. Topological and Spectral Analyses of Gene Regulatory Networks Topological and algebraic analyses of the GRNs are given in Table 3. The WS ecotype in total light spaceflight environment has the largest spectral gap, which indicates that this network has the highest performance with stable synchronization, rapid convergence, mixing, expansion, and diffusion [47]. Random walks propagate more easily in networks with a large spectral gap. The large spectral gap has also made several algorithms we use tractable for such massively large GRN and indicates that in technical terms, these GRNs are highly sparse. This corroborates with results from other studies that have shown that the WS genotype increases the transcriptional cost of spaceflight adaptation [20]. The diameter of this network is 6, indicating that it has longer gene signaling pathways, and the hub genes of this network regulate about 1000 target genes. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes in the ground light environment show topological similarities with the same shortest path length, and the two networks show regulation of about 45 target genes. Table 3.

Rather than just the degree distribution, hubs and authority nodes are computed iteratively with newer algorithms considering weights using its implementation in the software SAGEMATH. Improved algorithms exist, e.g., [35], and some of Kleinberg’s works.3.3. Arabidopsis Root Growth and Cell Wall Biosynthesis in Spaceflight Microgravity Out of the 33 root-growth related genes of Arabidopsis, we have identified five significant hub genes listed in Table 4 to have higher regulations in spaceflight. Figure 7 shows the subgraph that is extracted from the original Pearson correlation GRN by thresholding the genes with higher correlation values and involved in the cell wall biosynthesis metabolic process that relates the co-expression of these genes in spaceflight microgravity for the Arabidopsis Col mutant phyD ecotype. These five hub genes have higher regulations only in the spaceflight subgraph for the cell wall response process and not in the ground subgraph. These genes are over-represented in the spaceflight responsive transcriptome because they regulate plant growth in spaceflight microgravity and enable adaptation of the plant to the altered environment. Similarly, comparing the GRNs generated by the LASSO method for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight and ground environments, the hub genes that are involved only in spaceflight for cell wall biosynthesis have been identified and listed in Supplementary Table S2. Figure 8 shows the subgraph for the cell wall biosynthesis process for Arabidopsis WS ecotype in spaceflight microgravity, which is also extracted similarly by thresholding the correlation values. These genes encode NSEs and have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight, as they were not found to be hubs in the GRNs for the terrestrial datasets. These enzymes catalyze a series of biochemical reactions and are involved in building cell wall polysaccharides. The origin and divergence of these enzymes is not known, and it is interesting to note that they are significantly transcribed indicative of higher sugar diversity in spaceflight microgravity. The higher regulations of these genes may be the reason for the phenotypic skewing or waving effect found in the roots, as well as other parts of the plant in spaceflight. The differential transcriptions of NSEs indicate that they regulate developmental, metabolic, and stress-related responses in the spaceflight microgravity environment. Table 4.

Conclusions Graph-based network analysis methods and results have been presented for transcriptomic regulatory GeneLab Arabidopsis datasets. Previous studies were at the transcriptomic level. In this article, we have built gene regulatory networks for different ecotypes (via Pearson Correlation and LASSO methods), carried out both topological and algebraic network studies (the novel HITS algorithm for weighted and directed graphs to identify hubs and authority nodes), computed the spectral gap for the whole GRN, leading us to potential conclusions about phenomena such as diffusion and expansion of the GRN, and studied global and local topological parameters, such as clustering, average path length, eccentricity, and degree distribution. Therefore, our research is more complementary to prior studies and is more rigorous. Our novel graph-theoretic approach isolated hub genes regulated significantly different in spaceflight microgravity from terrestrial gene expressions. The GRN for the WS ecotype in spaceflight has the highest spectral gap, indicating that it has the highest transcriptional cost in spaceflight. GRN analysis showed that there are 38 genes with higher transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in vital molecular and biological functions for the survival and growth of the plant in spaceflight. While previous research has identified altered spaceflight transcriptions for cell wall remodeling, we have identified hub genes with higher transcriptional activity and that are involved in the cell wall response process only in spaceflight GRN; these hub genes are essentially metabolic phenotypes. The network analysis has detected xyloglucan endo-trans glycosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) that are cell wall modifying enzymes mediating vital elongation growth of Arabidopsis in spaceflight. The XTHs act on the cell wall, making it more extensible, resulting in cellular expansion and the skewing phenomenon of the roots in spaceflight microgravity. Through advanced network analysis, we can shorten the gap between genotype to phenotype analysis by identifying primary metabolites or metabolic phenotypes involved in the growth of plants in spaceflight for bioregenerative life support. In the absence of mass spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging methods in the ISS, and lack of plant physiological measurements, genome to phenome network analysis offers an alternative for identifying primary metabolic phenotypes. The spaceflight response of these metabolites can be further correlated with phenotypic data extracted from images and metabolomics datasets acquired from experiments conducted in the ISS or from similar experiments on the ground. Phenotypic data will enable novel trait correlations employing genome to phenome network analysis.Acknowledgments The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant 80NSSC19M0167.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment. Keywords: ionizing radiation, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis, Pearson correlation, non-radiation-induced genes, Markov blanket, causal relation, logistic regression, Jaccard similarity index, flavonoids and carotenoids",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Space is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of Arabidopsis [7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR in Arabidopsis has shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination [8]. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) are Arabidopsis homologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes [9]. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis due to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in [10]. Two mutants of Arabidopsis defective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation [11]. The effect of acute radiation on Arabidopsis growth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in [12]. Apart from DDR, plants adopt pigment biosynthesis processes to protect them against Ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These pigments are flavonoids, betalains, and carotenoids. Flavonoids provide a range of color from pale-yellow to blue and belong to the class of phenylpropanoids [13]. Carotenoids contain up to 15 conjugated double bonds [14]. It has been shown that light induces expression of carotenoid genes during leaf, flower development, and fruit ripening in Arabidopsis [15]. Carotenoids protect the plant against excessive light and add color to the flowers, fruits, and seeds [16]. 163 ATR/ATM genes in Arabidopsis have been shown experimentally as responding to ionizing radiation in [11]. We call these ATR/ATM genes radiation-induced genes and other downstream genes of stress signaling non-radiation-induced genes [17]. There is no putative radiation subnetwork analysis for detecting radiation and non-radiation induced genes that are involved in biological processes related to radiation response in the plant. In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation on Arabidopsis found in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR on Arabidopsis: gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR [18]. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds. In this paper, we investigate CBP regulation in the spaceflight environment, as well. As modules are more informative for the regulatory mechanism of a biological process [19], we perform module-based analysis and have identified radiation and non-radiation induced gene/protein interactions in DNA repair processes, as well as flavonoids and carotenoids that respond to light environment in spaceflight. We call these modules subnetworks. The hypothesis of this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods Datasets from the GeneLab repository [20] are mined for studying the effects of low radiation doses in low Earth orbit, and very high doses of high LET and gamma photos found beyond Earth’s atmosphere on Arabidopsis. All the omics datasets in GeneLab are preprocessed and normalized before being published. The radiation metadata for GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 are given in Supplementary Table S1. 2.1. GeneLab Datasets GLDS-7: the dataset contains microarray gene expression data from the tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) of the plant Arabidopsis Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) ecotypes grown in spaceflight and ground control [21]. Ground control experiments were conducted using identical ABRS hardware and an environmental chamber programmed to International Space Station (ISS) environmental conditions. The data contains 20,000 genes with five expression values per component. GLDS-120 dataset contains the transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis WS and Col-0 ecotypes, and the gene Phytochrome D (phyD) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are light and dark in spaceflight, and light and dark on the ground. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes [22,23]. The GLDS-7 and GLS-120 datasets were collected under a low dose of radiation, with an average absorbance of 1.25 milliGray (mGY) and an average absorbance of 1.655 mGY for low-LET (SAA), and an average cumulative absorbed dose of 1.86 mGY. GLDS-37 dataset contains the transcriptomic data of four different ecotypes of Arabidopsis in spaceflight microgravity and on the ground: Col-0, LER-2, WS-2, and Cvi-0. The seeds of the mentioned ecotypes are germinated in orbit and grown for eight days [24]. Ground control data is collected under the same environmental stressors. RNAseq is performed to analyze the transcriptomic changes of the ecotypes. GLDS-38 dataset contains proteomics and transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seeds were flown in the International Space Station (ISS) and allowed to germinate and grow for three days in microgravity [25]. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60 mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs, and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). The GLDS 37 dataset was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 1.06 mGY. The GLDS-38 data was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 0.38 mGY. The above four datasets correspond to radiation exposure in low Earth orbit spaceflights. GLDS-46 dataset was collected under HZE (1 Giga electron Volt (GeV) Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and photons (γR) which have low rates of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) on Arabidopsis seedlings. Both types of radiation showed DSB damage response. This dataset was collected under a very high dose of 100 Gy at a dose rate of 1.8 Gy/min. A 100 Gy radiation dose in Arabidopsis would generate the same number of DSBs as a 4Gy dose in humans. We are interested in this dataset because of foreseen long-term manned missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field to the moon and Mars [18]. 2.2. Gene Regulatory Network Inferencing Using Pearson Correlation We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G:= (V,E) where |V| is the set of vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and |E| is the set of edges, which is an ordered pair of V. The graph (V, E, o, t) is called directed, if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph G = (V,E,o,t), the edges e = (u,v), the origin of e is denoted by o and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two variables (genes, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables (x and y) divided by the product of their standard deviations. Gene expression values ranging from three to eight for each gene are used to compute Pearson correlation. The expression values are linearly related, hence Pearson correlation is used [26]. We have applied Pearson correlation network analysis to identify key gene players for cell wall biosynthesis, and root growth in Arabidopsis in spaceflight using the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets [27]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered co-expressed if their p-value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold p-value. The t-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and, hence there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the genes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intramodule (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Vertices (u,v) are the edges (arcs), respectively [28]. A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a real-valued weight w. In our approach, the weights of the edges between two nodes (genes) are the correlation values. 2.3. Causal Relations Discovery Using Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) Method Causal relations are difficult to infer and require careful application of experimental interventions. However, causal relations can be discovered by statistical analysis of purely observational data, which is known as causal structure learning [29]. Using Markov properties, a gene is conditionally independent of all other genes except its parents, children, and children’s parent variables (genes). Causal relationships are useful for combining omics data with Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), for inferring relationships between genotype and phenotype [30]. The method used for causal relation inferencing here is the Markov Blankets (MB) method and Bayesian Network (BN) learning [31,32,33,34]. Joint conditional probabilities are represented by a graph in a Bayesian network, the nodes (genes) are connected by the Markov property which states that a node is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Applying the faithfulness condition, the IAMB of any node (gene) in a BN is the set of parents, children, and spouses (the other parents of their common children) of the gene [32]. We determine the direct causes of a gene’s upregulation, the effects on a gene or a protein due to the upregulation of the gene, as well as the upregulation of the causes of the activation of the gene. In our case, each gene is a variable with a series of expression values. The Markov blanket of a gene X is the smallest set MB(X) containing all genes carrying information about X that cannot be obtained from any other gene. The MB(X) of a node (gene) X includes its parents, children, and spouses which are the strongly relevant genes to gene X; that is, of genes that support and are associated with the target gene (X). Association measures and conditional independent tests are applied to identify the strongly relevant genes [35,36]. Hence, MB(T) is a causal structure learning algorithm useful for the discovery of regulatory interactions among genes from gene expression data. 2.4. Computation of Network Measures The network measures include spectral gap, girth or diameter, density, connected components, and Jaccard similarity [28,37,38]. These are used to compare the subnetworks for each of the processes. Spectral gap: For a graph G, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as 1 = |λ1| ≥ |λ2|≥ · · · ≥|λn| (G may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The Spectral gap is defined as: δλ = |λ1| − |λ2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of G, the eigenvalues are λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Laplacian spectral gap will be: δλ = 1 − |λ2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ2 is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, which means λ2 = 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or if Γ is bipartite), this means a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence, the larger the spectral gap (the smaller|λ2|), the better the network flow (large h(G), diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network G). Girth of a graph is the smallest positive integer r such that Trace(Ar) > 0. Let d = d(G) be the smallest integer (if it exists) so that for every pair of vertices (u,v) there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then d(G) is called the diameter or maximum eccentricity of the graph G. Density of a graph is the ratio between the number of edges and the number of possible edges. Density is a measure of the compactness of a module (subnetwork) and measures the connectivity strength of pairs of genes in the module [19]. Connected component in a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the super graph. Jaccard similarity index is used to quantify the neighborhood similarity between two vertices (genes), it is also called topological similarity [39]. The Jaccard index calculates the proportion of v-type genes between two u-type genes, relative to the total number of v-type genes connected to either u-type genes [40]. An index of 1 indicates the exact similarity between u and v, while 0 indicates no similarity between the two sets. The above measures are computed for the subnetworks. If the Jaccard similarity is 0.5, it indicates that half of the genes in one subnetwork are also found in the other subnetwork. Furthermore, hub genes of subnetworks are compared using the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measures. Degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of node i is the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix, with the sum over all nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree kin and kout. In this case, the degree distribution is computed for the hub genes in the four low radiation dose subnetworks. Subgraph Centrality of a node is a weighted sum of closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at a node. Centrality measures are used widely in biological networks to infer protein-protein interactions and identify essential proteins [41,42,43]. 2.5. Logistic Regression-Based Gene Ranking Logistic regression, also called a logit model, is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there is any number of variables that determine an outcome. The goal of this method is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between a dichotomous characteristic of interest (dependent variable; response or outcome variable) and the explanatory variable. It is used to model the log-odds of a gene belonging to a specific category as a linear function of the statistical significance. Most likely enriched gene sets will be identified based on the p-value or based on the odds ratio if a ranking independent of category size is desired [44]. The logistic regression method is an extension of the χ2-test and has higher statistical power than other methods because the important values do not depend on a threshold. Figure 1 shows the steps involved in the extraction of radiation subnetworks. Pearson correlation and IAMB methods outlined in Section 2B and 2C are applied to the GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 expression values of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype in spaceflight to construct the GRNs. Weak correlations are eliminated by thresholding p-values which correspond to the largest t-test statistics in the Pearson correlation GRNs. GSEA is used to extract subnetworks of significant DDR processes with a majority of higher activations of radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. Radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub genes are identified in the subnetworks. In these subnetworks, genes that have strong correlations with radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes are detected. The genes significantly altered due to other spaceflight parameters that are not correlated with ATR/ATM genes are not detected. Network measurements listed in Section 2D are computed and used to analyze the subnetworks. Certain non-radiation-induced genes that interact with the radiation-induced hub genes are detected in the DDR processes subnetworks. The associated processes and molecular functions of the key non-radiation induced genes that interact with the ATR/ATM radiation-induced hub genes are identified. Flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis processes are identified from the Pearson GRNs and MB causal relational networks and their corresponding subnetworks are extracted. The carotenoid and flavonoid hub genes are detected in the subnetworks. The logistic regression method explained in Section 2E takes the network measurements for the radiation-induced hub genes in the subnetworks as input and ranks them from the most to the least significant.

    "results": "3. Results The gene expression values (three in GLDS-120, three in GLDS-38, five in GLDS -7, six in GLDS-37, and eight in GLDS-46) are used to construct Pearson correlation GRNs. The datasets are analyzed separately. Weak correlations with p-values greater than 0.0005 are removed. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [45] of the Pearson correlation GRNs for low radiation dose datasets reveals four main processes with higher activation of the ATR and ATM genes. They are cellular response to stimulus, cellular response to stress, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and DNA metabolic processes. The radiation protection pigment biosynthesis processes identified are the flavonoid biosynthesis process and carotene catabolic process. The subnetworks for these processes are extracted from the GRNs for each dataset. The hub genes are detected by thresholding the degree distribution of the subnetworks. A threshold between 5 and 34 for the degree distribution is used to select the hub genes for the Low Radiation Dose (LRD - LRD1 refers to GLDS-37, LRD2 refers to GLDS-38, LRD3 refers to GLDS-7 and LRD4 refers to GLDS-120) subnetworks. A threshold of 19 to 47 is used to select the hub genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks (HZE and γR radiation GLDS-46 dataset). The protein-protein interactions in the subnetworks are discussed below. The hub genes for each process are given by their Arabidopsis Gene Identifier and their gene names inside the parenthesis. The gene names are also listed in the Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. The gene ontologies of the ATG genes are obtained from [17,46]. 3.1. Cellular Response to Stimulus Cellular response to stimulus process is the mechanism by which a cell detects and responds to external or internal signaling stimuli causing the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, and gene expression [47]. Table 1 and Table 2 show the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measure for the hub genes in the subnetworks for the cellular response to stimulus process in Arabidopsis grown in low radiation dose datasets LRD1 and LRD2, and datasets LRD3 and LRD4, respectively. The higher centrality values in LRD4 subnetwork show the greater occurrence of the three genes AT3G27060 (TSO2), AT3G51920 (CML9), and AT1G70940 (PIN3) (Table 2) in the pathways of other genes and play an active role in the cellular response to stimulus process. A higher value of degree distribution for the hub-gene indicates that it is the most influential gene in the biological pathway. The low radiation dose subnetworks for LRD1 and LRD2 datasets have more hub genes for this process (Table 1). The genes AT3G13380 (BRL3), AT3G61630 (CRF6), and AT5G61600 (ERF104) have higher values than other hub genes in the low radiation dose subnetworks. They are brassinosteroid receptor proteins and ethylene-responsive transcription factors involved in protein and DNA-binding molecular functions. Table 1.

Cellular Response to DNA Damage Stimulus DNA damage due to environmental stress such as radiation or errors in metabolism causes the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, and gene expression. There are no common hub genes for this process in the LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks. However, the same gene AT3G27060 that responds to stress also shows higher activity in response to DNA damage stimuli in LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks. The network measures for this process are given in the second row in Table 4. 3.4. DNA Metabolic Process DNA metabolism includes both DNA synthesis and degradation reactions involved in DNA replication and repair [49]. Through this process, the cellular DNA levels are maintained. The LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks do not have any common hub genes for this process, but the AT3G27060 is involved in this process in the LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks. It also has high subgraph centrality values in both the cellular response to DNA damage and DNA metabolic processes (second and third rows of Table 4) showing that it is involved in several pathways for both the cellular response to DNA damage and DNA metabolic processes. Figure 2 shows the subnetwork for cellular response to stress process under low radiation dose (LRD3 dataset), and Figure 3 shows the subnetwork for the DNA metabolic process under low radiation dose (LRD4 dataset), respectively. The degree distribution and subgraph centrality have the highest values for the hub genes in the total light low radiation dose subnetwork from the LRD4 dataset as can be seen in Figure 3. All the genes except the hub genes (red circles) are non-radiation-induced in this subnetwork. These genes are involved in responses to osmotic and water stress, and response to cadmium ions, metal ions, inorganic substances, and water deprivation. Figure 2.

The hub genes AT3G27060 (TS02) and AT2G21790 (RNR1) are being activated by the genes at the non-arrow end of the edge. Both of these genes have a high in-degree distribution. 3.5. Flavonoid Biosynthesis and Carotenoid Catabolic Processes The subnetworks for flavonoid biosynthesis and carotenoid catabolic processes with higher activations of genes that encode and regulate flavonoids and carotenoids are extracted from GRNs of Arabidopsis grown in total light environment (LRD4) dataset. Figure 4A,B show the interaction profiles of these genes with green circles for flavonoid encoding genes, and yellow circles for carotenoid encoding genes, respectively. These pigments are involved in UV radiation protection. They have been reported to have higher regulations in several ground-based studies on UV response of Arabidopsis [50]. There are higher regulations of flavonoids and carotenoids, which also include negative regulations as indicated by the weights on the edges of Figure 4A,B. From the low radiation dose dataset LRD4, we also find causal relations of five flavonoid genes and nine carotenoid genes, as shown in Figure 4C. Figure 4.

Subnetwork Measurments for the Low, and Very High Radiation Dose DDR Processes We compare the subnetworks for low radiation doses using topological and algebraic network measures. Table 5 summarizes these measures. We constructed GRNs and applied GSEA to extract the subnetworks for DDR processes with a larger regulation of the ATR/ATM genes for the very high radiation dose of HZE and γR radiation dataset (GLDS-46). We analyzed the subnetwork measurements for this dataset to understand the effects of very high doses of radiation on plants grown for life support in long-term deep-space missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere to the Moon and Mars [18]. The two main processes identified from the GRNs of the very high radiation dose datasets are DNA metabolic process and nucleic acid response process. Figure 5 shows the subnetwork for the DNA metabolic process in Arabidopsis under a very high HZE radiation dose. Figure 6 shows the subnetwork for the nucleic acid response process under a very high γR radiation dose. The network measures for these two processes are summarized in Table 6. Table 5.

Hence, the spectral gap measures are much higher for these subnetworks ranging from 7.5153 to 12.2554 as seen in Table 6, whereas the spectral gaps for the low radiation dose subnetworks in Table 5 have lesser values ranging from 0.068 to 0.858. The larger the spectral gap (the smaller |λ2|), the higher the network flow with sparseness, expansion, diffusion, and random walk. Hence, these networks have a higher measure of random walks, implying that the nodes that lie closer to each other in the network perform similar functions [51]. This also indicates that the plant has higher transcriptional costs in adapting to the very high levels of radiation in the environment. The low radiation dose subnetworks (LRD3 and LRD4) have a large number of connected components ranging from 3 to 9, while the HZE and γR subnetworks have only one connected component. Also, the low radiation dose subnetworks have an average shortest path of 1.5 and a diameter of 1 or 2. The processes for the very high dose of HZE and γR radiation subnetworks have an average shortest path of 3.25 and a diameter between 2 and 5. Also, there are no non-radiation-induced genes identified in the very high radiation dose subnetworks. 3.7. Jaccard Similarity Between Subnetworks The Jaccard similarity indices in Table 7 show the neighborhood similarity of radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub-genes for the DDR processes influenced by very high doses of HZE and γR radiation. It also shows the similarity of the neighborhood for the hub gene in the two subnetworks for the low radiation dose DDR processes. The values closer to one indicate that the genes AT2G31320 (PARP1), AT4G21070 (BRCA1), and AT2G46610 (RS31A), and AT3G27060 (TSO2) have similar interactions in the subnetworks for the two processes. The closer the values are to zero, the genes have minimal interaction similarity in the neighborhood for the two processes. Table 7.

Logistic Regression Ranking of Hub Genes The subgraph centrality, closeness centrality, degree distribution, page rank, and eigenvalue centrality network measures are used by the logistic regression method to rank the top correlated genes from the Pearson GRNs. Apart from the hub genes for the subnetworks, the other top-ranked radiation-induced genes from the low radiation dose subnetworks are AT3G21280 (UBP7), AT1G07500 (SMR5), and AT5G66140 (PAD2). Logistic regression of the top correlated genes in the HZE and γR subnetworks resulted in all of the high ranked genes being radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. No non-radiation-induced genes are among the top 50 ranked genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks. 3.9. Causal Relational Network Analysis Figure 7 shows a part of the causal relational subnetwork for the LRD1 dataset. There are two key radiation-induced genes AT1G27940 (Q9C7F8) and AT3G60420 (Q9M217) related to eight non-radiation-induced genes. In a causal graph, for any node (gene) X, its parents and children are the immediate nodes (genes) that are strongly relevant in its activation [36]. The higher activation of a parent gene will lead to the activation of the child gene, as well. The activation of the parent gene is the cause, and the activation of the child gene is the effect. The MB(AT1G27940) has six children genes, and the MB(AT3G60420) has two parent genes, which indicates that this gene has a causal relationship with these two other genes. In addition, there are 82, 72, 69, and 69 one-to-one causal relations between radiation-induced genes and non-radiation genes in each of the LRD1, LRD2, LRD3, and LRD4 subnetworks, respectively. The parent gene carries information most relevant to the child gene, that cannot be obtained from another gene. The key radiation-induced genes for low radiation dose are shown in Figure 8 in red color. The MB(AT4G28950) has one child AT1G10800, MB(AT1G23000) has one parent AT5G40380, and MB(AT1G15580) has one child AT1G06360. The genes that are related to AT3G60420 are involved in plant growth and developmental processes. The genes AT1G10800, AT1G06350 (ADS4), and AT5G40380 (CRK42) (Figure 8) encode proteins and are involved in other biological processes such as ATP binding, protein phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and metabolic processes.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion 4.1. Computational Strategy Radiation data for GLDS studies in the ISS are provided in [52]. Previous studies of Arabidopsis in spaceflight missions have focused on non-radiation stress responses that are due to microgravity, although radiation is an important stressor in spaceflight [47]. The effect of ionizing radiation has been presented using traditional fold change analysis methods in [11,18]. The novelty of our approach is the performance of computational modular subnetwork analysis of biological processes involving a majority of radiation-induced genes. Our modular analysis approach provides a better insight into the complex gene interaction profiles between radiation-induced and non-radiation-induced genes in DDR processes. We have also determined gene associations using the Bayesian Markov blanket method which identifies key genes based on the relevance of gene associations. This method is attractive because of its ability to describe complex stochastic processes with noisy observations. We have used IAMB innovatively in identifying causal relations between ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes and non-radiation-induced genes. We have innovatively used the Jaccard similarity index to show the similarity of neighborhood interactions of ATR/ATM genes in the subnetworks for DDR processes. This index is not biased by low-level, noise-derived, variability in expression [53]. We have also shown how topological network measures of degree distribution are useful for the extraction of subnetwork modules from larger GRNs. The subnetworks sampled from the original GRNs also have a scale-free topology with a degree distribution that follows an exponential power law [54]. Centrality measures are useful for distinguishing protein complexes [55]. It has been shown that the subgraph centrality has better discriminatory power than other centrality measures such as Eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness centrality [56]. Subgraph centrality has been used here to distinguish the hub genes involved in the DDR processes. The network measures of diameter, connected components, and density have important biological implications as they can predict gene regulatory interaction landscape intrinsic to the organism [57]. The density is the lowest for the LRD2 dataset indicating the sparseness of the subnetworks [58]. The network measures for the subnetworks reveal quantitatively different emerging properties for Arabidopsis grown in different radiation dose environments. The number of connected components and diameter of the subnetworks for the DDR processes show large variability for low and very high radiation doses. The spectral gap has large values in the very high radiation dose subnetworks than in low radiation dose subnetworks indicating sparseness and high connectivity of the networks. Many biological systems are modular which results from the sparseness in the GRNs [59]. The novel algebraic analysis using spectral gap computations informs us about the diffusion, mixing, and expansion properties of important genes in different radiation dose environments. Through spectral analysis, we have shown that very high doses of radiation, results in large complex biomolecular networks with higher values of the spectral gap. Several machine learning methods such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, naïve Bayes classifier, stochastic gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have been applied to gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes [60]. The advantage of logistic regression is that it allows the evaluation of multiple explanatory variables. It is easy to implement, interpret, and train. It is better than linear regression which produces continuous output, while logistic regression produces discrete output. This method has ranked the ATR/ATM hub genes of low radiation dose subnetworks, and 50 ATR/ATM genes as the top gene players responding to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in spaceflight. 4.2. ATR/ATM Gene Interactions The ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes involved in DNA repair response in Arabidopsis are shown as hub-genes (red color) in the subnetwork modules in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6. We have identified other non-radiation-induced gene players from the DDR processes. These genes encode proteins that are involved in DNA repair as well as other responses to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and oxidative stress, osmotic stress, salt stress, light stress, cell growth, and metabolic processes. The pigment biosynthesis process subnetworks shown in Figure 4 (LRD4—GLDS 120 dataset) reveal significant genetic interactions with non-pigment genes, as well. This dataset was collected from Arabidopsis grown for 11 days in the ambient light of ISS [22]. None of the flavonoids and carotenoids show significant regulations in the other low radiation dose datasets, and very high doses of HZE and γR radiation datasets, and the reason for this could be the absence of light stimulation. In Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6 the AT2G30250 (WRKY) transcription factors and other Arabidopsis ATR and ATM orthologues identified as hub genes are activated by several downstream target genes of stress signaling. The role of the ATR and ATM as the initiators of comprehensive signal transductions in response to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation is probably achieved at the post-translational level [9,61]. Figure 4B represents the ABA biosynthetic activation as part of the stress responses which involves some of the carotenoid catabolic pathways. The HZE and γR radiation DDR responses of the plant exhibit complex subnetworks for the DNA metabolic and the nucleic acid processes in response to very high doses of radiation. The genes AT3G13380, AT5G61600, AT5G48720, and AT3G27060 in low radiation dose subnetworks play key roles in the regulation of plant biological processes enabling the plant to be repair proficient, thereby inhibiting any phenotypic changes during growth. The causal associations of key ATR/ATM genes with other genes show the most relevant genes important for the adaptation of the plant to different levels of radiation. The 18 genes AT3G13380, AT3G61630, AT5G61600, AT3G27060, AT3G51920, AT1G70940, AT5G48720, AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, AT3G21280, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, AT1G27940, AT3G60420, AT4G28950, AT1G23000, and AT1G15580 identified in this research are essential regulators of the processes in response to DNA damage. Table 8 summarizes the functions of the ATR/ATM genes which shows clearly that these genes are not only involved in DNA damage response but are also involved in other biological processes. Table 8.

Open in a new tabThe ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes respond to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in concert with non-radiation-induced genes that respond to other environmental stressors such as ROS, salt, light, heat, and water changes in spaceflight. The MB causal relational subnetworks show the ATR/ATM genes related with genes that regulate root development, and plant growth, indicating that increased radiation tolerance by genetic activations may have a side effect on the plant growth. This fact has to be considered while genetically engineering plants for DNA repair response which may have undesired side-effects such as reduced yield. Further experiments are necessary to study the effect of long-term exposure of plants to space radiation and the best mechanisms to overcome the harmful effects of radiation. The overexpression of several genes and their side effects may be averted by suitable enclosures that can shield the plant from spaceflight radiation.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions We have applied advanced network analysis and machine learning approaches to detect key genes involved in DDR and their links with genes involved in spaceflight stress responses in Arabidopsis. Our analysis shows that the DDR processes are intermixed with the regulation of critical functions necessary for the plant to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There is a significant difference in the regulation of these processes in a low radiation dose environment where ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes interact with many downstream genes, whereas in the very high HZE and γR radiation dose environment, the DDR processes are regulated chiefly by ATR/ATM genes.",

Copyright notice ID: 8234954 PMID: 34205326 Abstract Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment. Keywords: ionizing radiation, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis, Pearson correlation, non-radiation-induced genes, Markov blanket, causal relation, logistic regression, Jaccard similarity index, flavonoids and carotenoids1. Introduction Space is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of Arabidopsis [7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR in Arabidopsis has shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination [8]. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) are Arabidopsis homologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes [9]. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis due to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in [10]. Two mutants of Arabidopsis defective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation [11]. The effect of acute radiation on Arabidopsis growth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in [12]. Apart from DDR, plants adopt pigment biosynthesis processes to protect them against Ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These pigments are flavonoids, betalains, and carotenoids. Flavonoids provide a range of color from pale-yellow to blue and belong to the class of phenylpropanoids [13]. Carotenoids contain up to 15 conjugated double bonds [14]. It has been shown that light induces expression of carotenoid genes during leaf, flower development, and fruit ripening in Arabidopsis [15]. Carotenoids protect the plant against excessive light and add color to the flowers, fruits, and seeds [16]. 163 ATR/ATM genes in Arabidopsis have been shown experimentally as responding to ionizing radiation in [11]. We call these ATR/ATM genes radiation-induced genes and other downstream genes of stress signaling non-radiation-induced genes [17]. There is no putative radiation subnetwork analysis for detecting radiation and non-radiation induced genes that are involved in biological processes related to radiation response in the plant. In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation on Arabidopsis found in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR on Arabidopsis: gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR [18]. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds. In this paper, we investigate CBP regulation in the spaceflight environment, as well. As modules are more informative for the regulatory mechanism of a biological process [19], we perform module-based analysis and have identified radiation and non-radiation induced gene/protein interactions in DNA repair processes, as well as flavonoids and carotenoids that respond to light environment in spaceflight. We call these modules subnetworks. The hypothesis of this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes. 2. Materials and Methods Datasets from the GeneLab repository [20] are mined for studying the effects of low radiation doses in low Earth orbit, and very high doses of high LET and gamma photos found beyond Earth’s atmosphere on Arabidopsis. All the omics datasets in GeneLab are preprocessed and normalized before being published. The radiation metadata for GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 are given in Supplementary Table S1. 2.1. GeneLab Datasets GLDS-7: the dataset contains microarray gene expression data from the tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) of the plant Arabidopsis Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) ecotypes grown in spaceflight and ground control [21]. Ground control experiments were conducted using identical ABRS hardware and an environmental chamber programmed to International Space Station (ISS) environmental conditions. The data contains 20,000 genes with five expression values per component. GLDS-120 dataset contains the transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis WS and Col-0 ecotypes, and the gene Phytochrome D (phyD) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are light and dark in spaceflight, and light and dark on the ground. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes [22,23]. The GLDS-7 and GLS-120 datasets were collected under a low dose of radiation, with an average absorbance of 1.25 milliGray (mGY) and an average absorbance of 1.655 mGY for low-LET (SAA), and an average cumulative absorbed dose of 1.86 mGY. GLDS-37 dataset contains the transcriptomic data of four different ecotypes of Arabidopsis in spaceflight microgravity and on the ground: Col-0, LER-2, WS-2, and Cvi-0. The seeds of the mentioned ecotypes are germinated in orbit and grown for eight days [24]. Ground control data is collected under the same environmental stressors. RNAseq is performed to analyze the transcriptomic changes of the ecotypes. GLDS-38 dataset contains proteomics and transcriptomics data of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seeds were flown in the International Space Station (ISS) and allowed to germinate and grow for three days in microgravity [25]. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60 mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs, and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). The GLDS 37 dataset was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 1.06 mGY. The GLDS-38 data was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 0.38 mGY. The above four datasets correspond to radiation exposure in low Earth orbit spaceflights. GLDS-46 dataset was collected under HZE (1 Giga electron Volt (GeV) Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and photons (γR) which have low rates of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) on Arabidopsis seedlings. Both types of radiation showed DSB damage response. This dataset was collected under a very high dose of 100 Gy at a dose rate of 1.8 Gy/min. A 100 Gy radiation dose in Arabidopsis would generate the same number of DSBs as a 4Gy dose in humans. We are interested in this dataset because of foreseen long-term manned missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field to the moon and Mars [18]. 2.2. Gene Regulatory Network Inferencing Using Pearson Correlation We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G:= (V,E) where |V| is the set of vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and |E| is the set of edges, which is an ordered pair of V. The graph (V, E, o, t) is called directed, if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph G = (V,E,o,t), the edges e = (u,v), the origin of e is denoted by o and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two variables (genes, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables (x and y) divided by the product of their standard deviations. Gene expression values ranging from three to eight for each gene are used to compute Pearson correlation. The expression values are linearly related, hence Pearson correlation is used [26]. We have applied Pearson correlation network analysis to identify key gene players for cell wall biosynthesis, and root growth in Arabidopsis in spaceflight using the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets [27]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered co-expressed if their p-value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold p-value. The t-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and, hence there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the genes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intramodule (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Vertices (u,v) are the edges (arcs), respectively [28]. A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a real-valued weight w. In our approach, the weights of the edges between two nodes (genes) are the correlation values.2.3. Causal Relations Discovery Using Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) Method Causal relations are difficult to infer and require careful application of experimental interventions. However, causal relations can be discovered by statistical analysis of purely observational data, which is known as causal structure learning [29]. Using Markov properties, a gene is conditionally independent of all other genes except its parents, children, and children’s parent variables (genes). Causal relationships are useful for combining omics data with Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), for inferring relationships between genotype and phenotype [30]. The method used for causal relation inferencing here is the Markov Blankets (MB) method and Bayesian Network (BN) learning [31,32,33,34]. Joint conditional probabilities are represented by a graph in a Bayesian network, the nodes (genes) are connected by the Markov property which states that a node is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Applying the faithfulness condition, the IAMB of any node (gene) in a BN is the set of parents, children, and spouses (the other parents of their common children) of the gene [32]. We determine the direct causes of a gene’s upregulation, the effects on a gene or a protein due to the upregulation of the gene, as well as the upregulation of the causes of the activation of the gene. In our case, each gene is a variable with a series of expression values. The Markov blanket of a gene X is the smallest set MB(X) containing all genes carrying information about X that cannot be obtained from any other gene. The MB(X) of a node (gene) X includes its parents, children, and spouses which are the strongly relevant genes to gene X; that is, of genes that support and are associated with the target gene (X). Association measures and conditional independent tests are applied to identify the strongly relevant genes [35,36]. Hence, MB(T) is a causal structure learning algorithm useful for the discovery of regulatory interactions among genes from gene expression data.2.4. Computation of Network Measures The network measures include spectral gap, girth or diameter, density, connected components, and Jaccard similarity [28,37,38]. These are used to compare the subnetworks for each of the processes. Spectral gap: For a graph G, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as 1 = |λ1| ≥ |λ2|≥ · · · ≥|λn| (G may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The Spectral gap is defined as: δλ = |λ1| − |λ2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of G, the eigenvalues are λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Laplacian spectral gap will be: δλ = 1 − |λ2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ2 is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, which means λ2 = 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or if Γ is bipartite), this means a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence, the larger the spectral gap (the smaller|λ2|), the better the network flow (large h(G), diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network G). Girth of a graph is the smallest positive integer r such that Trace(Ar) > 0. Let d = d(G) be the smallest integer (if it exists) so that for every pair of vertices (u,v) there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then d(G) is called the diameter or maximum eccentricity of the graph G. Density of a graph is the ratio between the number of edges and the number of possible edges. Density is a measure of the compactness of a module (subnetwork) and measures the connectivity strength of pairs of genes in the module [19]. Connected component in a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the super graph. Jaccard similarity index is used to quantify the neighborhood similarity between two vertices (genes), it is also called topological similarity [39]. The Jaccard index calculates the proportion of v-type genes between two u-type genes, relative to the total number of v-type genes connected to either u-type genes [40]. An index of 1 indicates the exact similarity between u and v, while 0 indicates no similarity between the two sets. The above measures are computed for the subnetworks. If the Jaccard similarity is 0.5, it indicates that half of the genes in one subnetwork are also found in the other subnetwork. Furthermore, hub genes of subnetworks are compared using the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measures. Degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of node i is the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix, with the sum over all nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree kin and kout. In this case, the degree distribution is computed for the hub genes in the four low radiation dose subnetworks. Subgraph Centrality of a node is a weighted sum of closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at a node. Centrality measures are used widely in biological networks to infer protein-protein interactions and identify essential proteins [41,42,43].2.5. Logistic Regression-Based Gene Ranking Logistic regression, also called a logit model, is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there is any number of variables that determine an outcome. The goal of this method is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between a dichotomous characteristic of interest (dependent variable; response or outcome variable) and the explanatory variable. It is used to model the log-odds of a gene belonging to a specific category as a linear function of the statistical significance. Most likely enriched gene sets will be identified based on the p-value or based on the odds ratio if a ranking independent of category size is desired [44]. The logistic regression method is an extension of the χ2-test and has higher statistical power than other methods because the important values do not depend on a threshold. Figure 1 shows the steps involved in the extraction of radiation subnetworks. Pearson correlation and IAMB methods outlined in Section 2B and 2C are applied to the GLDS-7, 120, 37, 38, and 46 expression values of Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype in spaceflight to construct the GRNs. Weak correlations are eliminated by thresholding p-values which correspond to the largest t-test statistics in the Pearson correlation GRNs. GSEA is used to extract subnetworks of significant DDR processes with a majority of higher activations of radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. Radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub genes are identified in the subnetworks. In these subnetworks, genes that have strong correlations with radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes are detected. The genes significantly altered due to other spaceflight parameters that are not correlated with ATR/ATM genes are not detected. Network measurements listed in Section 2D are computed and used to analyze the subnetworks. Certain non-radiation-induced genes that interact with the radiation-induced hub genes are detected in the DDR processes subnetworks. The associated processes and molecular functions of the key non-radiation induced genes that interact with the ATR/ATM radiation-induced hub genes are identified. Flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis processes are identified from the Pearson GRNs and MB causal relational networks and their corresponding subnetworks are extracted. The carotenoid and flavonoid hub genes are detected in the subnetworks. The logistic regression method explained in Section 2E takes the network measurements for the radiation-induced hub genes in the subnetworks as input and ranks them from the most to the least significant. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Flow diagram showing the sequence of steps followed for extraction of radiation response subnetworks from the gene expression values in the GLDS datasets and network analysis.The Pearson correlation GRN construction is implemented in Python, and the causal relational analysis using the IAMB method is implemented in R. The computational algorithms for the network measures, and logistic regression ranking of hub genes are implemented in Python. The github link for the scripts is provided in the Supplementary Material.3. Results The gene expression values (three in GLDS-120, three in GLDS-38, five in GLDS -7, six in GLDS-37, and eight in GLDS-46) are used to construct Pearson correlation GRNs. The datasets are analyzed separately. Weak correlations with p-values greater than 0.0005 are removed. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [45] of the Pearson correlation GRNs for low radiation dose datasets reveals four main processes with higher activation of the ATR and ATM genes. They are cellular response to stimulus, cellular response to stress, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and DNA metabolic processes. The radiation protection pigment biosynthesis processes identified are the flavonoid biosynthesis process and carotene catabolic process. The subnetworks for these processes are extracted from the GRNs for each dataset. The hub genes are detected by thresholding the degree distribution of the subnetworks. A threshold between 5 and 34 for the degree distribution is used to select the hub genes for the Low Radiation Dose (LRD - LRD1 refers to GLDS-37, LRD2 refers to GLDS-38, LRD3 refers to GLDS-7 and LRD4 refers to GLDS-120) subnetworks. A threshold of 19 to 47 is used to select the hub genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks (HZE and γR radiation GLDS-46 dataset). The protein-protein interactions in the subnetworks are discussed below. The hub genes for each process are given by their Arabidopsis Gene Identifier and their gene names inside the parenthesis. The gene names are also listed in the Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. The gene ontologies of the ATG genes are obtained from [17,46]. 3.1. Cellular Response to Stimulus Cellular response to stimulus process is the mechanism by which a cell detects and responds to external or internal signaling stimuli causing the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, and gene expression [47]. Table 1 and Table 2 show the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measure for the hub genes in the subnetworks for the cellular response to stimulus process in Arabidopsis grown in low radiation dose datasets LRD1 and LRD2, and datasets LRD3 and LRD4, respectively. The higher centrality values in LRD4 subnetwork show the greater occurrence of the three genes AT3G27060 (TSO2), AT3G51920 (CML9), and AT1G70940 (PIN3) (Table 2) in the pathways of other genes and play an active role in the cellular response to stimulus process. A higher value of degree distribution for the hub-gene indicates that it is the most influential gene in the biological pathway. The low radiation dose subnetworks for LRD1 and LRD2 datasets have more hub genes for this process (Table 1). The genes AT3G13380 (BRL3), AT3G61630 (CRF6), and AT5G61600 (ERF104) have higher values than other hub genes in the low radiation dose subnetworks. They are brassinosteroid receptor proteins and ethylene-responsive transcription factors involved in protein and DNA-binding molecular functions. Table 1.

Cellular Response to Stress Environmental stressors such as extreme temperature, exposure to toxins, radiation, and mechanical damage result in molecular changes that cells undergo in response to these stressors [48]. Table 3 shows the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measure for the hub genes in the subnetworks for the cellular response to stress process for low radiation dose (datasets LRD1 and LRD2).

While there are four hub genes involved in cellular response to stress in the low radiation dose LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks, there is only one hub gene in the low radiation dose LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks (Table 4).

Cellular Response to DNA Damage Stimulus DNA damage due to environmental stress such as radiation or errors in metabolism causes the cell to change in state or activity in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, and gene expression. There are no common hub genes for this process in the LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks. However, the same gene AT3G27060 that responds to stress also shows higher activity in response to DNA damage stimuli in LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks. The network measures for this process are given in the second row in Table 4. 3.4. DNA Metabolic Process DNA metabolism includes both DNA synthesis and degradation reactions involved in DNA replication and repair [49]. Through this process, the cellular DNA levels are maintained. The LRD1 and LRD2 subnetworks do not have any common hub genes for this process, but the AT3G27060 is involved in this process in the LRD3 and LRD4 subnetworks. It also has high subgraph centrality values in both the cellular response to DNA damage and DNA metabolic processes (second and third rows of Table 4) showing that it is involved in several pathways for both the cellular response to DNA damage and DNA metabolic processes. Figure 2 shows the subnetwork for cellular response to stress process under low radiation dose (LRD3 dataset), and Figure 3 shows the subnetwork for the DNA metabolic process under low radiation dose (LRD4 dataset), respectively. The degree distribution and subgraph centrality have the highest values for the hub genes in the total light low radiation dose subnetwork from the LRD4 dataset as can be seen in Figure 3. All the genes except the hub genes (red circles) are non-radiation-induced in this subnetwork. These genes are involved in responses to osmotic and water stress, and response to cadmium ions, metal ions, inorganic substances, and water deprivation. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Subnetwork for cellular response to stress process in Arabidopsis under low radiation dose (LRD3) dataset. Red circles are hub genes. There are 7 significant hub genes in this subnetwork. Larger the circles, higher the value of in-degree distribution.Figure 3.

The hub genes AT3G27060 (TS02) and AT2G21790 (RNR1) are being activated by the genes at the non-arrow end of the edge. Both of these genes have a high in-degree distribution.3.5. Flavonoid Biosynthesis and Carotenoid Catabolic Processes The subnetworks for flavonoid biosynthesis and carotenoid catabolic processes with higher activations of genes that encode and regulate flavonoids and carotenoids are extracted from GRNs of Arabidopsis grown in total light environment (LRD4) dataset. Figure 4A,B show the interaction profiles of these genes with green circles for flavonoid encoding genes, and yellow circles for carotenoid encoding genes, respectively. These pigments are involved in UV radiation protection. They have been reported to have higher regulations in several ground-based studies on UV response of Arabidopsis [50]. There are higher regulations of flavonoids and carotenoids, which also include negative regulations as indicated by the weights on the edges of Figure 4A,B. From the low radiation dose dataset LRD4, we also find causal relations of five flavonoid genes and nine carotenoid genes, as shown in Figure 4C. Figure 4.

Subnetwork Measurments for the Low, and Very High Radiation Dose DDR Processes We compare the subnetworks for low radiation doses using topological and algebraic network measures. Table 5 summarizes these measures. We constructed GRNs and applied GSEA to extract the subnetworks for DDR processes with a larger regulation of the ATR/ATM genes for the very high radiation dose of HZE and γR radiation dataset (GLDS-46). We analyzed the subnetwork measurements for this dataset to understand the effects of very high doses of radiation on plants grown for life support in long-term deep-space missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere to the Moon and Mars [18]. The two main processes identified from the GRNs of the very high radiation dose datasets are DNA metabolic process and nucleic acid response process. Figure 5 shows the subnetwork for the DNA metabolic process in Arabidopsis under a very high HZE radiation dose. Figure 6 shows the subnetwork for the nucleic acid response process under a very high γR radiation dose. The network measures for these two processes are summarized in Table 6. Table 5.

Hence, the spectral gap measures are much higher for these subnetworks ranging from 7.5153 to 12.2554 as seen in Table 6, whereas the spectral gaps for the low radiation dose subnetworks in Table 5 have lesser values ranging from 0.068 to 0.858. The larger the spectral gap (the smaller |λ2|), the higher the network flow with sparseness, expansion, diffusion, and random walk. Hence, these networks have a higher measure of random walks, implying that the nodes that lie closer to each other in the network perform similar functions [51]. This also indicates that the plant has higher transcriptional costs in adapting to the very high levels of radiation in the environment. The low radiation dose subnetworks (LRD3 and LRD4) have a large number of connected components ranging from 3 to 9, while the HZE and γR subnetworks have only one connected component. Also, the low radiation dose subnetworks have an average shortest path of 1.5 and a diameter of 1 or 2. The processes for the very high dose of HZE and γR radiation subnetworks have an average shortest path of 3.25 and a diameter between 2 and 5. Also, there are no non-radiation-induced genes identified in the very high radiation dose subnetworks.3.7. Jaccard Similarity Between Subnetworks The Jaccard similarity indices in Table 7 show the neighborhood similarity of radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub-genes for the DDR processes influenced by very high doses of HZE and γR radiation. It also shows the similarity of the neighborhood for the hub gene in the two subnetworks for the low radiation dose DDR processes. The values closer to one indicate that the genes AT2G31320 (PARP1), AT4G21070 (BRCA1), and AT2G46610 (RS31A), and AT3G27060 (TSO2) have similar interactions in the subnetworks for the two processes. The closer the values are to zero, the genes have minimal interaction similarity in the neighborhood for the two processes. Table 7.

Logistic Regression Ranking of Hub Genes The subgraph centrality, closeness centrality, degree distribution, page rank, and eigenvalue centrality network measures are used by the logistic regression method to rank the top correlated genes from the Pearson GRNs. Apart from the hub genes for the subnetworks, the other top-ranked radiation-induced genes from the low radiation dose subnetworks are AT3G21280 (UBP7), AT1G07500 (SMR5), and AT5G66140 (PAD2). Logistic regression of the top correlated genes in the HZE and γR subnetworks resulted in all of the high ranked genes being radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. No non-radiation-induced genes are among the top 50 ranked genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks. 3.9. Causal Relational Network Analysis Figure 7 shows a part of the causal relational subnetwork for the LRD1 dataset. There are two key radiation-induced genes AT1G27940 (Q9C7F8) and AT3G60420 (Q9M217) related to eight non-radiation-induced genes. In a causal graph, for any node (gene) X, its parents and children are the immediate nodes (genes) that are strongly relevant in its activation [36]. The higher activation of a parent gene will lead to the activation of the child gene, as well. The activation of the parent gene is the cause, and the activation of the child gene is the effect. The MB(AT1G27940) has six children genes, and the MB(AT3G60420) has two parent genes, which indicates that this gene has a causal relationship with these two other genes. In addition, there are 82, 72, 69, and 69 one-to-one causal relations between radiation-induced genes and non-radiation genes in each of the LRD1, LRD2, LRD3, and LRD4 subnetworks, respectively. The parent gene carries information most relevant to the child gene, that cannot be obtained from another gene. The key radiation-induced genes for low radiation dose are shown in Figure 8 in red color. The MB(AT4G28950) has one child AT1G10800, MB(AT1G23000) has one parent AT5G40380, and MB(AT1G15580) has one child AT1G06360. The genes that are related to AT3G60420 are involved in plant growth and developmental processes. The genes AT1G10800, AT1G06350 (ADS4), and AT5G40380 (CRK42) (Figure 8) encode proteins and are involved in other biological processes such as ATP binding, protein phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and metabolic processes.

Computational Strategy Radiation data for GLDS studies in the ISS are provided in [52]. Previous studies of Arabidopsis in spaceflight missions have focused on non-radiation stress responses that are due to microgravity, although radiation is an important stressor in spaceflight [47]. The effect of ionizing radiation has been presented using traditional fold change analysis methods in [11,18]. The novelty of our approach is the performance of computational modular subnetwork analysis of biological processes involving a majority of radiation-induced genes. Our modular analysis approach provides a better insight into the complex gene interaction profiles between radiation-induced and non-radiation-induced genes in DDR processes. We have also determined gene associations using the Bayesian Markov blanket method which identifies key genes based on the relevance of gene associations. This method is attractive because of its ability to describe complex stochastic processes with noisy observations. We have used IAMB innovatively in identifying causal relations between ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes and non-radiation-induced genes. We have innovatively used the Jaccard similarity index to show the similarity of neighborhood interactions of ATR/ATM genes in the subnetworks for DDR processes. This index is not biased by low-level, noise-derived, variability in expression [53]. We have also shown how topological network measures of degree distribution are useful for the extraction of subnetwork modules from larger GRNs. The subnetworks sampled from the original GRNs also have a scale-free topology with a degree distribution that follows an exponential power law [54]. Centrality measures are useful for distinguishing protein complexes [55]. It has been shown that the subgraph centrality has better discriminatory power than other centrality measures such as Eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness centrality [56]. Subgraph centrality has been used here to distinguish the hub genes involved in the DDR processes. The network measures of diameter, connected components, and density have important biological implications as they can predict gene regulatory interaction landscape intrinsic to the organism [57]. The density is the lowest for the LRD2 dataset indicating the sparseness of the subnetworks [58]. The network measures for the subnetworks reveal quantitatively different emerging properties for Arabidopsis grown in different radiation dose environments. The number of connected components and diameter of the subnetworks for the DDR processes show large variability for low and very high radiation doses. The spectral gap has large values in the very high radiation dose subnetworks than in low radiation dose subnetworks indicating sparseness and high connectivity of the networks. Many biological systems are modular which results from the sparseness in the GRNs [59]. The novel algebraic analysis using spectral gap computations informs us about the diffusion, mixing, and expansion properties of important genes in different radiation dose environments. Through spectral analysis, we have shown that very high doses of radiation, results in large complex biomolecular networks with higher values of the spectral gap. Several machine learning methods such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, naïve Bayes classifier, stochastic gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have been applied to gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes [60]. The advantage of logistic regression is that it allows the evaluation of multiple explanatory variables. It is easy to implement, interpret, and train. It is better than linear regression which produces continuous output, while logistic regression produces discrete output. This method has ranked the ATR/ATM hub genes of low radiation dose subnetworks, and 50 ATR/ATM genes as the top gene players responding to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in spaceflight. 4.2. ATR/ATM Gene Interactions The ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes involved in DNA repair response in Arabidopsis are shown as hub-genes (red color) in the subnetwork modules in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6. We have identified other non-radiation-induced gene players from the DDR processes. These genes encode proteins that are involved in DNA repair as well as other responses to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and oxidative stress, osmotic stress, salt stress, light stress, cell growth, and metabolic processes. The pigment biosynthesis process subnetworks shown in Figure 4 (LRD4—GLDS 120 dataset) reveal significant genetic interactions with non-pigment genes, as well. This dataset was collected from Arabidopsis grown for 11 days in the ambient light of ISS [22]. None of the flavonoids and carotenoids show significant regulations in the other low radiation dose datasets, and very high doses of HZE and γR radiation datasets, and the reason for this could be the absence of light stimulation. In Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6 the AT2G30250 (WRKY) transcription factors and other Arabidopsis ATR and ATM orthologues identified as hub genes are activated by several downstream target genes of stress signaling. The role of the ATR and ATM as the initiators of comprehensive signal transductions in response to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation is probably achieved at the post-translational level [9,61]. Figure 4B represents the ABA biosynthetic activation as part of the stress responses which involves some of the carotenoid catabolic pathways. The HZE and γR radiation DDR responses of the plant exhibit complex subnetworks for the DNA metabolic and the nucleic acid processes in response to very high doses of radiation. The genes AT3G13380, AT5G61600, AT5G48720, and AT3G27060 in low radiation dose subnetworks play key roles in the regulation of plant biological processes enabling the plant to be repair proficient, thereby inhibiting any phenotypic changes during growth. The causal associations of key ATR/ATM genes with other genes show the most relevant genes important for the adaptation of the plant to different levels of radiation. The 18 genes AT3G13380, AT3G61630, AT5G61600, AT3G27060, AT3G51920, AT1G70940, AT5G48720, AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, AT3G21280, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, AT1G27940, AT3G60420, AT4G28950, AT1G23000, and AT1G15580 identified in this research are essential regulators of the processes in response to DNA damage. Table 8 summarizes the functions of the ATR/ATM genes which shows clearly that these genes are not only involved in DNA damage response but are also involved in other biological processes. Table 8.

Open in a new tabThe ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes respond to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in concert with non-radiation-induced genes that respond to other environmental stressors such as ROS, salt, light, heat, and water changes in spaceflight. The MB causal relational subnetworks show the ATR/ATM genes related with genes that regulate root development, and plant growth, indicating that increased radiation tolerance by genetic activations may have a side effect on the plant growth. This fact has to be considered while genetically engineering plants for DNA repair response which may have undesired side-effects such as reduced yield. Further experiments are necessary to study the effect of long-term exposure of plants to space radiation and the best mechanisms to overcome the harmful effects of radiation. The overexpression of several genes and their side effects may be averted by suitable enclosures that can shield the plant from spaceflight radiation. 5. Conclusions We have applied advanced network analysis and machine learning approaches to detect key genes involved in DDR and their links with genes involved in spaceflight stress responses in Arabidopsis. Our analysis shows that the DDR processes are intermixed with the regulation of critical functions necessary for the plant to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There is a significant difference in the regulation of these processes in a low radiation dose environment where ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes interact with many downstream genes, whereas in the very high HZE and γR radiation dose environment, the DDR processes are regulated chiefly by ATR/ATM genes.Acknowledgments The material contained in this document is based upon work supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) grant 80NSSC19M0167.

One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation.

Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions. Keywords: low Earth orbit, environmental enrichment, neuroblasts, doublecortin, activated caspase-3 in the past decade, space agencies have transitioned from completion of low Earth orbit missions in the International Space Station to proposal of long-term interplanetary missions to the Moon and Mars (18, 109). The increased duration and distance of these future missions may compromise the health of crewmembers during spaceflight, as the crew will have to adapt to a combination of environmental factors unique to spaceflight. These factors include presumably negative factors such as ionizing particle radiation (78), microgravity (96), abnormal circadian rhythm triggers (8, 54), and psychosocial stress (43), as well as potentially positive factors, such as the novel environment of the spacecraft and mission. While it is not completely understood how these combined and dynamic factors affect the health of crewmembers, evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) undergoes adaptations to spaceflight that may impair mission success (17, 19, 65, 84, 96). More work is needed, however, to better understand how discrete regions of the CNS and their respective functions are modulated by the experience of spaceflight. A useful brain region in which to explore the effects of spaceflight on the CNS is the olfactory bulb (OB). The structure and function of the OB are highly influenced by environmental and physiological stimuli (51), such that changes in OB size often positively correlate with changes in olfactory function. For example, in mammals, including humans, increased OB volume correlates with enhanced OB function and recovery following olfactory trauma (83). In contrast, decreased OB volume correlates with diminished olfactory input (37) and diminished olfactory ability (28, 39). However, olfactory function can also be improved following odor deprivation (6), indicating the bidirectional nature of OB plasticity to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. OB plasticity is not only linked with changes in olfactory ability but also may provide early insight into the progression of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases (35, 38, 104). For example, deficits in olfaction are frequently observed well before the appearance of severe neurological symptoms associated with late-stage Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (35). Decreased OB size is also observed in a rat model of depression (107), emphasizing the clinical relevance of OB volume. A major contributor to the plasticity of OB volume is neurogenesis, or the process of birth and death of OB neurons that continues throughout life. Functional OB interneurons, granule cells, and periglomerular cells are generated into adulthood (50, 51), and their integration is correlated with the complexity of the olfactory environment (59, 75, 80, 81). For example, sensory enrichment or passive exposure to new odorants increases OB neurogenesis (57, 66, 93) and sensory activity (55, 59) and improves olfactory discrimination abilities (60, 61, 80). Improved olfactory discrimination, in turn, strengthens synaptic function in the olfactory cortex (27). In contrast, sensory deprivation by nostril occlusion reduces new OB granule cell number and OB function (58, 85). Although OB neurogenesis continues throughout life, it is influenced by many factors, some of which are present during spaceflight. For example, high doses of acute and chronic ionizing radiation decrease OB volume and neurogenesis in rodents (22, 36, 46), which may jeopardize OB function (57, 85). However, it is unknown how the entire spaceflight experience, including exposure to both negative and positive factors noted above, influences OB size and neurogenesis. To address how the unique combination of environmental and physiological factors present during spaceflight influence OB structure, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in adult mice shortly following a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135]. We hypothesized that due to the numerous negative factors present during spaceflight, mice aboard STS-135 would have decreased OB volume and neurogenesis compared with mice maintained on Earth. Interestingly, however, we found that mice maintained on Earth in animal enclosure modules (AEM) that mimicked the onboard flight conditions had greater OB volume and neurogenesis compared with mice maintained in standard housing conditions on Earth and mice housed in AEM cages onboard STS-135. These findings suggest that factors present during space travel have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals. Female C57BL/6 mice (9 wk of age; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were shipped directly to NASA Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on June 21, 2011, where they were housed in identical conditions and allowed to acclimate for >4 wk prior to the start of experimental activities. During this time, mice were weighed ∼3 times/wk and divided into three groups: Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight. All Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice were chosen from the same shipment of mice with matched birthdates and body weights. AEM-Flight mice flew onboard the STS-135 in animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the shuttle's middeck lockers (lockers MF43K, MF57M, and MF57H) for 13 days (July 8, 2011 to July 20, 2011). An AEM consisted of a 24.5 × 43.7 × 51.1 cm self-contained rodent cage with 0.25-in. stainless steel mesh on all interior components, four internal fan blowers, a layered particulate and odor filter system, and four interior lamps (providing an average of 14 lux illumination during the light cycle) set to a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (21, 69). Food bars (94) were glued to sidewalls and a redundant Lixit water unit was provided for ad libitum feeding and drinking. Each AEM was also equipped with a clear top through which a crewmember could observe behavior. Crewmembers monitored the health status and performed daily animal welfare checks, but no quantitative physiological or behavioral assessments of the mice were performed in real time. Mice in the Vivarium group were group-housed in standard, ventilated vivarium cages and maintained on Earth at KSC in the barrier facility located within the SLSL. AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice were loaded into identical AEM units with a 48-h offset to enable matching of critical environmental conditions. Specifically, the ground-based AEMs were placed within an Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) to duplicate the Space Shuttle middeck temperature, relative humidity, and partial pressure of CO2 (32, 96). All other experimental procedures conducted on AEM-Flight mice were duplicated on both Vivarium and AEM-Ground mice. The NASA-Ames Research Center and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved this study. Approval was also obtained for the transfer of mouse tissues among institutions.Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry. Within 6 h of shuttle landing at KSC (AEM-Flight mice) or 48 h later (Vivarium and AEM-Ground mice), mice were anesthetized with ∼3.5% isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Brains were rapidly removed and the OB was fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by three PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) rinses and then equilibrated in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS. Once the OB tissue had sunk, an indication of cryoprotection, samples were shipped overnight at 4°C to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas. OB tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. freezing medium and was coronally sectioned using a cryostat with the chamber temperature maintained at −16 to −18°C. The main OB (+6.0 to +3.5 mm from bregma) was sectioned at 30 μm in a 1:8 series. Serial sections were stored free-floating in 0.1 M PBS with 0.1% NaN3. Prior to immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections were mounted onto superfrost-plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and were allowed to dry for 2 h. After drying, sections were incubated in 0.01 M citric acid (pH 6.0, 100°C) for 15 min for antigen retrieval. They were then incubated in 0.3% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidases, and then transferred to blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in 1× PBS) for 1 h (1). The following primary antibodies were used: goat polyclonal anti-doublecortin (DCX; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-activated caspase-3 (AC3; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibody incubation was followed by 2 h incubation in the appropriate biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and 90 min in ABC (1:50; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The signal was visualized with DAB/metal concentrate (10×; Thermo Scientific). Sections were counterstained with Fast Red (Vector Laboratories), dehydrated with graded ethanols, and coverslipped using DPX (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany).Cell quantification. All cell quantification was done in a blinded fashion. Unbiased estimates for DCX cell counts were obtained using stereological methods on an Olympus BX51 System Microscope with a MicroFIRE A/R camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA). Estimation of total DCX+ cell number in the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) layers of the OB was performed using the Optical Fractionator Probe within the Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, MicroBrightField, Williston, VT) according to previously published stereological methods (92, 110). An unbiased counting frame superimposed on the region of interest was used to quantify cell number. Counting was performed using a 100×, 1.4-NA oil immersion lens. To reduce bias between samples, several measures were undertaken. All tissue was processed for IHC in the same manner. To decrease the effect of shrinkage on the tissue, the average measured mounting thickness after processing was ∼16 μm, and an optical disector height of 14 μm was used. The area-sampling fraction was 1/25 and every 8th section (section sampling fraction of 1/8) was used to calculate DCX+ cells within the OB GCL and GL. The Gunderson coefficient of variance for each animal quantified was always <10%. Data are reported as the total number of DCX+ cells in the OB or OB subregion. The distribution of cells across the entire main OB was also analyzed at different distances from bregma, and data are presented as total number of cells in the OB or OB subregion at each septotemporal point. Modified stereology procedures were used to quantify total AC3+ cell number in the main OB. Brightfield staining of coded slides was visualized with an Olympus BX51 microscope using a 40×, 0.63 NA lens with continuous adjustment through the depth of the section (62). Using stereological principles (47), exhaustive counts for AC3+ cells in the OB GCL and GL (+6.0 to +3.5 mm from bregma) were collected. The section sampling fraction was 1/8 and the resulting number of AC3+ cells was multiplied by 8 and reported as total number of cells in the GCL or GL per brain. Because the raw counts (before multiplication) for AC3+ cells counted were low according to disector/fractionator standards (74, 102), we used an area sampling fraction of 1 as is commonly used for counting rare cell populations (41, 47). Based on our previous work from our laboratory and others (25, 41, 47), the height sampling fraction was set to 1. The data are presented as total number of cells in the OB GCL and GL and at each septotemporal point.Volume estimation. Volume estimation of individual OB subregions was performed using the Cavalieri Probe within Stereo Investigator (23, 71). Every 8th section was analyzed to measure the size of the GCL, internal plexiform layer (IPL), mitral cell layer (MCL), external plexiform layer (EPL), and the GL. Volume was estimated using a 10×, NA 0.30 lens. Area sizes were determined using the area measurement tool (based on the Cavalieri estimator) in which an automated grid of test points was superimposed upon the region of interest. Areas of individual cell layers were estimated from the total number of points that fell within the respective region. To obtain the volume, the sum of the areas measured was multiplied by the sampling fraction (1/8) and the section thickness (30 μm). The Gunderson coefficient of variance for each animal quantified was always <10%. Data are reported as the total estimated volume (μm3) of the respective cell layer. The size of the individual layers across the entire main OB was also analyzed at different distances from Bregma, and data are presented as total volume of the respective OB layer at each septotemporal point.Statistical analyses and data presentation. Data are expressed as means ± SE from 4–6 mice/group. Statistical analyses were performed with either one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) where appropriate (GraphPad Prism 6.0). Tukey's and Sidak post hoc comparisons were used to analyze significant ANOVAs. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS Body mass, food and water consumption, and AEM temperatures during the STS-135 mission. As previously reported, body mass of AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice was significantly lower at the completion of the STS-135 mission, with AEM-Ground mice weighing slightly more than AEM-Flight mice postflight (96). Total water intake of AEM-Ground mice was greater than AEM-Flight mice (mean ± SE: AEM-Ground 433.3 ± 16.67 ml; AEM-Flight 350.0 ± 0.0 ml; P < 0.001); and water intake per day has also been reported to differ in this same experiment (31). It was not possible to know whether this was due to actual greater consumption of water vs. greater loss of water during Lixit use on Earth vs. in flight. As previously reported, total food consumed and food consumed per day were similar between groups (31). Temperature matching within the OES was not exact: AEM-Ground mice experienced ∼2°C warmer temperatures than AEM-Flight mice for ∼48 h following launch and ∼24 h prior to landing (data not shown). AEM-Ground mice on the whole experienced ∼1°C warmer temperatures with less fluctuation (27–28.5°C) vs. AEM-Flight mice (23–29.5°C).AEM-Ground mice have greater OB GCL and GL volume relative to Vivarium mice and AEM-Flight mice. Given that OB volume is dynamically altered by environmental and physiological stimuli (22, 46, 51), we first examined the consequences of a 13-day spaceflight mission on OB volume (Fig. 1). Total OB volume in Vivarium mice was similar to published values (22, 110), and statistical analysis revealed a significant main effect of total OB volume among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice (F2,13 = 11.77, P < 0.01, Fig. 1B). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Ground mice had significantly larger total OB vs. both Vivarium (19% increase, P < 0.05) and AEM-Flight mice (33% increase, P < 0.01), with OB volume not different between Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice (P > 0.05). In addition to total OB volume, we also analyzed volume along the rostrocaudal extent of the main OB based on literature showing that the OB differs in cellular composition and function along this axis (9). This bregma analysis (Fig. 1C) revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 16.28, P < 0.001) and bregma (F8,117 = 71.58, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 1.778, P < 0.05). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Flight mice had consistently smaller OB volume from +5.4 to +4.5 mm bregma vs. Vivarium and AEM-Ground mice (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab AEM-Ground mice have increased olfactory bulb (OB) volume relative to AEM-Flight mice and Vivarium mice. A: representative image of the main olfactory bulb (+4.3 mm from bregma) showing the main cell layers: granule cell layer (GCL), internal plexiform layer (IPL), mitral cell layer (MCL), external plexiform layer (EPL), glomerular layer (GL), and olfactory nerve layer (ONL).

AEM, animal enclosure modules.As the OB consists of several subregions of different size, function, and cellular composition (9), we next asked whether the increase in AEM-Ground OB volume was due to selective increase in subregional volume in the GCL, GL, MCL, IPL, and EPL subregions of the OB (Fig. 1). The OB subregional volumes of Vivarium mice were similar to published values (22, 36, 110), with the GCL being largest, followed in decreasing volume by the EPL and GL, with the MCL and IPL both being the smallest (Fig. 1A). Analysis revealed a significant difference among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice in regards to GCL (F2,13 = 6.18, P < 0.01, Fig. 1D) and GL volume (F2,13 = 18.51, P < 0.001, Fig. 1F). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Ground mice exhibited significantly larger GCL (21%) and GL (27%) volumes vs. Vivarium mice (P < 0.05 for GCL, P < 0.01 for GL). This increase in GCL and GL volumes of AEM-Ground mice was not seen in AEM-Flight mice (P < 0.05 for GCL, P < 0.001 for GL), such that GCL and GL volumes did not differ between AEM-Flight and Vivarium mice (P > 0.05 for GCL and GL). GCL volume analyzed across bregma (Fig. 1E) revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F2,112 = 20.68, P < 0.001) and bregma (F8,112 = 53.09, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,112 = 2.638, P < 0.001). GL volume analyzed across Bregma (Fig. 1G) also revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 48.34, P < 0.001), bregma (F8,117 = 53.11, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 3.99, P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Ground mice had significantly larger GCL and GL volumes vs. AEM-Flight mice from +5.3 to +4.5 mm and +5.1 to +3.9 mm from bregma, respectively (Fig. 1, E and G). In regards to the EPL, MCL, and IPL cell layers, there was no significant main effect among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice in the EPL or MCL [EPL (mean ± SE): Vivarium 2.13 × 109 ± 1.61 × 108 μm3, AEM-Ground 2.37 × 109 ± 1.05 ± 108 μm3, AEM-Flight 1.78 × 109 ± 3.04 × 108 μm3, P > 0.05; MCL (mean ± SE): Vivarium 4.98 × 108 ± 2.51 × 107 μm3, AEM-Ground 5.58 × 108 ± 2.71 × 107 μm3, AEM-Flight 4.8 × 108 ± 2.20 × 107 μm3, P > 0.05]. In the IPL, however, there was a significant main effect among the three groups [IPL (mean ± SE): Vivarium 3.88 × 108 ± 2.0 × 107 μm3, AEM-Ground 4.6 × 108 ± 1.84 × 107 μm3, AEM-Flight 3.24 × 108 ± 4.08 × 107 μm3, F2,13 = 7.04, P < 0.01]. Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Flight mice had significantly smaller IPL vs. AEM-Ground mice (30% decrease, P < 0.01) but did not significantly differ from Vivarium mice (P > 0.05). When IPL volume was analyzed across bregma, there was a significant main effect of treatment (F2,111 = 11.70, P < 0.001) and bregma (F8,111 = 35.42, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,111 = 3.88, P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Ground mice had significantly greater IPL volume vs. AEM-Flight mice from +5.1 to +4.1 mm from bregma. Taken together, these volumetric measurements indicate that mice maintained on Earth in AEMs had significantly larger OBs compared with mice maintained in standard housing on Earth. This AEM-induced increase in OB volume was primarily due to larger OB GCL and GL, cell layers in which there is robust recruitment of adult-born neurons (50). Additionally, mice housed in AEMs onboard STS-135 had smaller OBs vs. AEM-Ground mice, such that they were not different from mice maintained in standard housing on Earth. The smaller OBs in AEM-Flight vs. AEM-Ground was primarily due to smaller GCL and GL volumes.AEM-Ground mice have more OB immature neuroblasts relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. Because the most substantial volume changes among the three groups of mice occurred in the OB GCL and GL, areas of ongoing neurogenesis (50, 51), we next analyzed DCX+ cells in these layers (Fig. 2, A–H). DCX labels immature neuroblasts that migrate into the OB and differentiate into interneurons, granule cells, and periglomerular cells (51). As previously shown, the majority of OB DCX+ cell bodies were in the GCL, with processes extending into the IPL (Fig. 2, A and B) (48). DCX+ cell bodies were also found in the GL, but were far fewer in number compared with the GCL (Fig. 2, E and F) (48). When examined among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice, statistical analyses revealed a significant main effect of DCX+ cells in the GCL (F2,13 = 8.13, P < 0.01, Fig. 2B) and GL (F2,13 = 4.38, P < 0.05, Fig. 2F). Post hoc analyses revealed that AEM-Ground mice had 36% and 41% more DCX+ cells in the GCL and GL, respectively, vs. Vivarium mice (GCL P < 0.01, GL P < 0.05). This AEM-induced increase in DCX+ cell number was not observed in AEM-Flight mice, as shown by 37% and 40% fewer DCX+ cells in the GCL and GL, respectively (both P < 0.05), of AEM-Flight vs. AEM-Ground mice. In fact, DCX+ cell number in AEM-Flight mice did not differ from Vivarium mice (GCL and GL both P > 0.05). When DCX+ cells in the GCL were analyzed along the rostrocaudal extent of the main OB, there was a significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 12.77, P < 0.001), bregma (F8,117 = 22.56, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 2.21, P < 0.001). Similarly, when DCX+ cells in the GL were analyzed along the rostrocaudal extent of the main OB, there was a significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 18.65, P < 0.001) and bregma (F8,117 = 33.08, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 2.99, P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that the GCL and GL of AEM-Ground mice had more DCX+ cells +5.1 to +3.9 mm from bregma than the GCL or GL in AEM-Flight or Vivarium mice (Fig. 2, C and G). The number of DCX+ cells did not differ between AEM-Flight and Vivarium mice at any distance from bregma. Fig. 2.

A: representative photomicrograph of the GCL in the OB stained for DCX and counterstained with Fast Red. Scale bar = 50 μm. B: no. of immature neurons, assessed by DCX immunoreactivity, in the GCL is significantly increased in AEM-Ground vs. Vivarium mice. This AEM-induced increase in DCX+ cell number is significantly decreased in AEM-Flight mice. C: DCX+ cells in the GCL plotted at different distances from bregma (+5.96 to 3.56 mm from bregma).

Scale bar = 50 μm. F: DCX+ cells in the GL are significantly increased in AEM-Ground vs. Vivarium mice. This AEM-induced increase in DCX+ cell number is significantly decreased in AEM-Flight mice. G: DCX+ cell numbers in the GL plotted at different distances from bregma (+5.96 to 3.56 mm from bregma). H: no. of DCX+ cells/mm3 in the GL was not significantly different among the 3 groups.

J: no. of apoptotic cells, as assessed by AC3+ immunoreactivity, in the GCL is significantly decreased in AEM-Ground vs. Vivarium mice. AEM-Flight mice also exhibited a strong trend for increased AC3+ cell number vs. AEM-Ground mice. K: AC3+ cell numbers in the GCL plotted at different distances from bregma (+5.96 to 3.56 mm from bregma). L: AEM-Ground mice had significantly fewer AC3+ cells/mm3 in the GCL vs. Vivarium and AEM-Flight. M: representative low-magnification photomicrograph (100× magnification) of the GL stained for AC3 and counterstained with Fast Red. Scale bar = 100 μm. M, inset: a higher magnification (400× magnification) image of the boxed area. Scale bar = 20 μm. N: there is a trend for fewer AC3+ cells in the GL of AEM-Ground mice vs. Vivarium mice, which is not seen in AEM-Flight mice. O: AC3+ cells in the GL plotted at different distances from bregma (+5.96 to 3.56 mm from bregma). P: AEM-Flight mice had significantly more AC3+ cells vs. AEM-Ground but not Vivarium mice. All data represent means ± SE. All total and cell density DCX+ and AC3+ data (B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P) analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. N = 4–6/group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. All bregma data (C, G, K, O) analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Sidak's post hoc test. N = 4–6/group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, AEM-Flight vs. AEM-Ground. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, AEM-Ground vs. Vivarium.AEM-Ground mice have less OB apoptosis relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. The continuous production of OB neurons in the adult is offset by ongoing cell death (75, 103, 106). Therefore, one possible explanation for the larger volume and greater number of immature neuroblasts in the OB GCL and GL in AEM-Ground mice was increased cell survival or decreased apoptosis (56, 80, 105). To address this, we quantified cell death in the OB GCL and GL using activated caspase-3 (AC3) as a marker for apoptotic cells (Fig. 2, I–P). There was a significant main effect of AC3+ cell number in the GCL among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice (F2,13 = 5.78, P < 0.01, Fig. 2J). The GCL of AEM-Ground mice had 47% fewer AC3+ cells vs. Vivarium mice (P < 0.05, Fig. 2J). While the GCL of AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice did not significantly differ in AC3+ cell number (P > 0.05), there was a trend for more (37%) AC3+ cells in AEM-Flight vs. AEM-Ground mice (Fig. 2J). When AC3+ cell number in the GCL were analyzed along the rostrocaudal extent of the main OB, there was a significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 20.74, P < 0.001) and bregma (F8,117 = 40.24, P < 0.001), and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 2.07, P < 0.001, Fig. 2K). Post hoc analyses revealed that there were fewer AC3+ cells +5.1 to +4.2 mm from bregma in the GCL of AEM-Ground mice vs. AEM-Flight mice (Fig. 2K). In the GL, there was a nonsignificant trend for a main effect of AC3+ cell number in the GL among the three groups (F2,13 = 2.80, P = 0.09, Fig. 2N). When AC3+ cell number in the GL was analyzed along the rostrocaudal extent of the main OB, there was a significant main effect of bregma (F8,117 = 5.92, P < 0.001) and a significant interaction (F16,117 = 2.17, P < 0.001), and a near-significant main effect of treatment (F2,117 = 2.63, P = 0.07, Fig. 2O).When OB subregional volume is taken into account, AEM-Ground mice still have less OB apoptosis relative to Vivarium and/or AEM-Flight mice. While it is common to use stereology to express data on cells immunoreactive for antigens linked to OB neurogenesis as “total number” (36, 48, 92), as we do in Fig. 2, B, C, F, G, J, K, N, and O, these data are also sometimes expressed as density (22, 110). Because of the significantly greater volume of the GCL and GL of AEM-Ground mice relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice, it is useful to consider the DCX+ and AC3+ cell data after taking volumetric measurements into account. Therefore, the ratio of total DCX+ or AC3+ cell number to the volume of the GCL (Fig. 2, D and H) and GL (Fig. 2, L and P) was calculated. When GCL and GL DCX+ cell numbers were normalized to their respective volumes, there was no significant difference among Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice (GCL: F2,13 = 1.24, P > 0.05, Fig. 2D; GL: F2,13 = 1.32, P > 0.05, Fig. 2H). However, when GCL and GL AC3+ cell numbers were normalized to their respective volumes, there was a significant main effect among the three groups (GCL: F2,13 = 6.29, P < 0.5, Fig. 2L; GL: F2,13 = 5.92, P < 0.05, Fig. 2P). Post hoc analyses showed that in the GCL AEM-Ground mice had significantly fewer AC3+ cells vs. both Vivarium (55% decrease, P < 0.05) and AEM-Flight mice (55% decrease, P < 0.05), with no difference between Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice (P > 0.05). In the GL, AEM-Ground mice had significantly fewer AC3+ cells vs. only AEM-Flight mice (76% decrease, P < 0.05). In sum, our results show that on Earth the AEM housing environment was associated with a larger OB, fewer AC3+ cells, and more DCX+ cells in OB regions that experience robust addition of new neurons throughout adulthood. Notably, this AEM-associated increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in mice aboard the STS-135 space shuttle.DISCUSSION Spaceflight is known to influence numerous aspects of mammalian physiology, including CNS structure and function (17, 19, 65, 84, 96). On Earth, many environmental factors shape OB size and neurogenesis, contributing to olfactory recognition and discrimination (45, 57, 93). Our hypothesis was that exposure to the cumulative factors experienced during spaceflight would have a detrimental effect on OB volume and neurogenesis. Interestingly, our findings here suggest that any negative influence of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis may be prevented or mitigated by exposure to a novel sensory environment, as provided by AEMs. Supporting this conclusion, we show that AEM-Ground mice had ∼25% larger OB relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. Specifically, the OB cell layers that experience ongoing addition of interneurons and their dendrites (i.e., GCL, GL, IPL) were larger in AEM-Ground mice, suggesting increased neurogenesis. Directly in support of increased neurogenesis, AEM-Ground mice had ∼50% more DCX+ cells and ∼50% fewer AC3+ apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. Notably, AEM-Flight mice had similar OB size and neurogenesis relative to Vivarium mice housed in standard conditions on Earth. Below we discuss possible interpretations of these data, and the implications for future basic research on spaceflight as well as human studies on Earth. AEMs: a novel sensory experience that preserves OB volume and neurogenesis by enhancing cell survival? The sensory experience offered by AEM housing is quite distinct from that provided in standard mouse cages in terms of temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, noise, air flow, lack of bedding, and cage mesh for climbing (21, 69). These individual AEM components may also interact and thus uniquely influence OB volume and neurogenesis in AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice. AEM-Flight mice also experience additional space-based environmental factors (weightlessness, radiation, human-derived odors, etc.) not present in Vivarium and AEM-Ground conditions. Our findings that OB volume, neuroblast number, and cell survival are all enhanced in AEM-Ground mice suggest that the AEM cages may be a form of sensory enrichment. This is consistent with reports that enriched environments positively regulate OB neurogenesis and function. For example, increased OB volume correlates with enhanced OB function and recovery in humans (83). In rodents, passive exposure to enriched odors stimulates neurogenesis and improves olfactory recognition and discrimination abilities (45, 55, 57, 60, 61, 66, 93). The increase in DCX+ neuroblasts in AEM-Ground mice could be due to increased survival (80, 81, 105) and neuroblast differentiation (48, 92). It could also be the result of increased migration of these cells from the subventricular zone (SVZ), the source of OB progenitors (4, 64), or from locally generated OB neurons (33, 49, 56, 67). While we hypothesize that AEMs are a form of sensory enrichment, this cannot be confirmed because there was no systematic quantification of physical and chemical properties of the AEM vs. Vivarium cages during this mission. It is therefore reasonable to consider the opposite view: perhaps AEMs are a form of odor deprivation. Indeed, they are equipped with air filters to absorb and trap odors (21). From this perspective, perhaps mice in AEMs are in an odor-deprived environment compared with Vivarium mice, and it is this odor deprivation that contributes to the larger OB and greater cell survival and neuroblast number. While this may seem counterintuitive, odor deprivation (e.g., via naris occlusion) can increase OB function (6). This alternative possibility is important to consider because we currently cannot experimentally isolate the effects of the olfactory context of the AEMs from the space-based manipulations at this time (73). However, the filter design within the AEM maintains sufficient control of odor leaving the units (21). Indeed, the likely similar accumulation of urine and fecal matter within the AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight cages counters the idea that AEMs are a form of odor deprivation. Of course, future control studies are needed to better assess the impact of olfactory context during spaceflight on OB neurogenesis and size (30). But as there are no examples in the literature where odor deprivation leads to larger OB and more neurogenesis, and as it is unclear whether naris occlusion leads to larger OB or more neurogenesis (6), we continue to favor the hypothesis that the AEMs are a form of sensory enrichment, not sensory deprivation. It is interesting to note when OB GCL and GL volumes were accounted for in regards to DCX+ and AC3+ cell numbers, only a significant decrease in AC3+ apoptotic cells existed between AEM-Ground mice and Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. In contrast, the increase in total DCX+ cells in the GCL and GL in AEM-Ground mice vs. Vivarium and AEM-Flight was diminished when volume was considered, suggesting that GCL and GL volume changes among the three groups may initially be due to a cell survival mechanism rather than altered neurogenesis (68, 106). One interpretation is that the unique sensory environment in the AEM cages facilitates neuroblast survival during the initial period of neuronal maturation, but the survival of these neuroblasts is hampered during spaceflight (75). It is also possible that a longer spaceflight mission may be needed to observe an increase in neuroblast number in AEM-Ground mice when DCX+ cells are normalized to volume. Nevertheless, these findings are in accordance with studies demonstrating that prolonged sensory experience promotes cell survival and integration of adult-born cells into the existing bulbar circuitry (81, 105), and in some cases, increased cell survival occurs without additional neurogenic alterations (80). For example, decreased cell survival and OB volume is observed in a mouse model of mitral cell degeneration with no accompanying changes in cell proliferation or migration (97). Also consistent with our data are studies demonstrating that cell survival in the OB is responsive to bidirectional modulation by sensory experience such that apoptosis in the GCL is increased in cases of naris closure, and this increase is reversed upon reopening (26, 68). Moreover, cell survival in the OB is also decreased in a mouse model of anosmia in which these mice cannot relay electrical signals in olfactory receptor neurons (75). These mice have a smaller OB but present no changes in granule cell proliferation, differentiation, or dendritic morphology (75). However, following neuronal maturation, many more granule cells undergo apoptosis, indicating that cell survival is dependent on olfactory activity (75). Collectively, these earlier studies resemble our current findings in which the sensory environment of the AEMs may promote activity-dependent survival in AEM-Ground mice, and to a lesser extent neuroblast differentiation, both processes that are not observed in AEM-Flight mice, likely due to stressors in the space environment. Our focus here was on the influence of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis. However, it is highly possible that astrocytic changes could also occur in tandem with our observed neuronal changes (3, 33) and contribute to the AEM-Ground associated increase in OB volume, neuroblast number, and cell survival. However, given that astrocytes can come from both local OB sources and from migrating cells in the anterior neurogenic region (33), such studies would optimally be performed with inducible fate mapping mice or other similar tools (7, 40, 47, 70). Therefore, separate studies would be needed to elucidate what proportion, for example, of the increase in OB volume in AEM-Ground mice presented here is due to astrocytic vs. neuronal changes, and to dissect to what extent they are influenced by increased cell migration (4, 64), neuronal maturation (48, 92), local generation of interneurons (33, 49, 56), or astrocytic changes (3, 33).Functional implications of sensory-induced cell survival in the OB. A major question left unanswered in our study is whether there are functional consequences resulting from the novel environment and the effects of spaceflight. Clearly, behavioral observation and functional assays during and after flight would have been ideal, but these were impossible due to the nature of the experiment and timing of tissue collection. However, the literature suggests a positive correlation between OB neurogenesis or volume and OB function (57, 66, 93). Thus, while purely speculative, increased survival of neuroblasts in AEM-Ground mice relative to Vivarium mice could correspond to increased activity of inhibitory interneurons, leading to broad changes in inhibitory processing of odorants (2, 55, 59, 66). For example, increased inhibitory inputs from GABAergic granule cells can decrease mitral cell activity, the principal relay neurons that project from the OB to the olfactory cortex (13, 14). Decreased mitral cell activity is correlated with narrowed specificity for odor detection, allowing for increased odor discrimination and neuronal remodeling (2, 13). The strengthening of inhibitory inputs also promotes cell survival, strengthens synaptic function (27), and enhances olfactory discrimination and perceptual learning (59, 66, 80). In addition to inhibitory inputs, dopaminergic periglomerular cells in the GL also function to optimize odor detection (15). Decreased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, a marker for dopaminergic neurons in the GL, is frequently observed in rodent models of naris closure and decreased odor discrimination (13, 58). While also purely speculative, it is possible that the increased survival of neuroblasts in AEM-Ground mice could also correspond to increased number of dopaminergic periglomerular cells. Future experiments are warranted to explore the hypothesis that increased survival of neuroblasts in AEM-Ground mice may be paralleled with an increase in GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons. Given the smaller OB, decreased neurogenesis, and increased apoptosis in AEM-Flight mice relative to AEM-Ground mice, it is very possible that olfactory physiology and function are compromised in AEM-Flight mice such that they may be equivalent to Vivarium mice. Alternatively, it is possible the multifactorial nature of the space-based environment disrupts the predictive relationship between olfactory neurogenesis, physiology, and function. For example, even if OB size and neurogenesis levels in AEM-Flight mice appear to be similar to Vivarium mice, it may not necessarily translate to identical OB physiology and function. The decreased neurogenesis in AEM-Flight vs. AEM-Ground mice may disrupt inhibitory activity and processing of granule, glomerular, or mitral cells so that incorrect information is relayed to the olfactory cortex. Consequently, even if OB size and neurogenesis are similar between AEM-Flight and Vivarium mice, OB physiology and circuitry could still be abnormal and significantly affect olfactory performance. Future examination of the functional implications of spaceflight for OB function will be necessary to test these hypotheses.Dissecting the influence of space-based environmental changes and olfactory context on OB neurogenesis and function. Our findings in AEM-Ground mice underscore the importance of including appropriate controls when designing studies to understand the effects of space travel on mammalian physiology. Omission of suitable environmental controls may prevent detection of certain physiological changes during spaceflight or lead to data misinterpretation. On a related note, in the future it will be important to design experiments to dissect the impact of olfactory context vs. olfactory ability to better assess the impact of spaceflight on OB physiology and function. This is because the numerous space-based environmental changes could interact and disrupt the predictive relationship between neurogenesis and olfactory physiology and function in AEM-Flight mice relative to AEM-Ground and Vivarium mice. Given that it is difficult to untangle olfactory context from the experimental manipulations (73), additional control studies are needed to better control for olfactory context to better assess the impact of spaceflight on OB neurogenesis and size (30). Additionally, if we had not had access to Vivarium controls we would have interpreted our current findings as showing a detrimental effect of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis. However, inclusion of the Vivarium controls has allowed us to make the more nuanced interpretation that spaceflight appears to negate the positive influence of AEMs on the OB, and not necessarily is overtly detrimental. Given this point, it is instructive to review the literature for how lack of inclusion of Vivarium controls, which are not always possible to access, might influence the interpretation of data from other space shuttle studies. For example, AEM-Flight mice from STS-131 and STS-135 missions had reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to muscle and the brain relative to AEM-Ground mice (10, 91, 96). Also, AEM-Flight mice from STS-118 and STS-135 had diminished T lymphocyte function and spleen size relative to AEM-Ground mice (31, 32). In total, these data were interpreted as showing spaceflight as detrimental to astronauts' physiology, for example compromising their ability to maintain blood flow (10, 91, 96). However, based on our findings presented here, it is plausible that these physiological changes in AEM-Flight mice may be less detrimental to astronaut health during spaceflight than have been proposed. Perhaps cerebral perfusion and/or T lymphocyte function are altered in AEM-Ground mice relative to Vivarium mice, concealing AEM-induced positive effects. Furthermore, as additional studies from the STS-135 mission emerge (63, 95, 108), it will also be worth considering if and how the physiological changes observed in AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice in regards to body mass (96), food and water consumption (31), and AEM temperatures may have contributed to some of the observed CNS changes. Collectively, it will be interesting to see how our findings that take into account the novel environment of the AEMs compare to additional space shuttle studies, including work examining the same mice from the STS-135 mission (10, 31, 96).Implications for human spaceflight. There are currently several approaches being used to remedy the adverse effects of microgravity (88, 89) and ionizing radiation (77, 90, 101) on general physiology and CNS function. It is encouraging that, in contrast to our hypothesis, mice aboard STS-135 had OB volume and neurogenesis levels indistinguishable from Vivarium-housed mice. This suggests that a novel sensory exposure could be a therapeutic strategy to counteract the negative effects of space travel on CNS structure and function and promote mission success. This is especially critical as space exploration programs are shifting towards interplanetary exploration of increased duration and distance (18, 109) that are likely to subject human crewmembers to prolonged exposure to more harsh conditions that can be detrimental to OB structure and function and impair mission success. On the other hand, we only were able to assess one time point after a 13-day mission. Given that humans and mice habituate to novel sensory stimuli, analysis of the OB from mice that experience shorter and longer missions would be useful in assessing the dynamic response to the environment, and would reveal how applicable our findings are for longer-term flights. To date there are no studies directly assessing human olfactory function following spaceflight. Certainly astronauts can smell; for example, many have reported what they call “the smell of space” (29), but no specific olfactory ability or discrimination experiments have been performed on crewmembers before, during, and/or after a space mission. There are simulated microgravity studies in which the weightlessness induces a cephalic fluid shift, i.e., an upward shift of body fluids toward the head that may influence olfactory abilities. These simulated studies reveal conflicting reports on odor function (12, 72, 98, 100). In addition, these studies are difficult to extrapolate to what might occur following a true space mission. Instead, there are strong correlates between reduced OB size in patients with olfactory disorders and reduced olfactory function (24, 34, 37, 39), and increased OB volume with enhanced OB function and recovery (83). These studies demonstrate that, similar to rodents, human OB structure and function is sensitive to olfactory experience and behavioral state, which, in turn, may be influenced by various physiological factors present during space travel. One concern in generalizing our studies in mice to human crewmembers is the extent to which OB neurogenesis occurs in humans (53). Neural stem cells reside in the SVZ lining the lateral ventricles in the human brain (42, 87), but it is controversial to what extent these cells give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the OB in the adult (11, 20, 52, 87). Recently, two studies demonstrated a dramatic decline in the number of migratory neuroblasts after birth in humans, but these migrating neuroblasts are nevertheless found in the adult brain in smaller numbers (86, 99). Even if a very small number of neuroblasts successfully migrate to the OB in the adult human brain, these neuroblasts could contribute to a significant percentage of OB neurons if they properly integrate into the olfactory circuitry. While purely speculative, our studies may be generalized to degenerative brain disease, as olfactory deficiency is often observed in humans during early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (35, 104), demonstrating that OB neurogenesis may hold clinical relevance for age-related neurological diseases. Taken together, our findings indicate that spaceflight missions may exert unique and opposing effects on adult OB neurogenesis, which could have clinical implications for OB function and neurodegenerative diseases. As our current findings suggest a protective effect of a novel environment on OB volume and neurogenesis, increasing cell survival could be a strategy to mitigate the negative effects of spaceflight for other at-risk CNS regions, and consequently enhance crew performance during long-term interplanetary missions. For example, the hippocampus is another brain region with ongoing adult neurogenesis and is also vulnerable to ionizing radiation, with proliferating cells and DCX+ neuroblasts being the most sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis (5, 79). Drastic reductions in proliferating cells and immature neurons can persist for months following ionizing radiation exposure, leading to reduced survival and differentiation of adult-born hippocampal neurons (5, 76, 82). There are longer-term implications for astronaut health as well. For example, ionizing radiation-induced neurological changes can contribute to disease onset such as Aβ plaque pathology, a pathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease, in the hippocampus (16), which may be due to reduced hippocampal neurogenesis (38, 104). Perhaps radiation-induced cell loss or radiation-induced acceleration of neurodegenerative disorders could be prevented by the protective effect of a novel environment (44). Importantly, progenitors in the hippocampus and OB respond differentially to ionizing radiation (36), possibly due to differing microenvironments of the two neurogenic regions. Therefore, future studies should analyze how the AEM experience from the STS-135 mission impacts hippocampal volume, neurogenesis, and cell death. Such data would provide a more complete picture of how adult-generated neurons in the CNS are influenced by spaceflight, and thus reveal potential impact on the CNS function of crewmembers during long-term missions.GRANTS BioServe Space Technologies and Kennedy Space Center support staff helped organize and oversee this project (funding support from Amgen, BioServe, and NASA-NNJ10GA25A).

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Space travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation.Methods Cardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.Results The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.Conclusions This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation may cause cardiac toxicity that involves pericarditis, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1,2]. While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients [3–5], adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure [6–8]. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material [9]. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel. One mechanism by which ionizing radiation may lead to cardiac toxicity is through increased oxidative stress. One characteristic of ionizing radiation is the formation of free radicals, e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10,11]. An increase in oxidative stress has been observed in Russian cosmonauts and in space flown animal models [12–14]. Recently, Azimzadeh et al., demonstrated a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), indicative of an increase in oxidative stress in post-mortem left ventricular tissue from Mayak nuclear workers that had been exposed to low dose-rate γ-radiation [15]. Furthermore, Soucy et al. demonstrated increased activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that generates ROS, in the rat aorta following exposure to 5 Gy γ-radiation [16]. Additionally, mitochondria isolated from mice 4 weeks after 2 Gy local heart X-ray irradiation show an increase in ROS levels when presented with an additional insult [17]. Oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is an important buffering mechanism to reduce ROS levels. Hence, the ratio of tissue levels of GSH to GSSG is used as one indicator of oxidative stress. Another mechanism by which radiation may affect the heart is through DNA methylation, an important mechanism of maintenance of cellular homeostasis [18,19]. Cardiovascular disease is associated with alterations of DNA methylation [20,21]. Moreover, radiation exposure has recently been shown to alter the DNA methylation patterns in the mouse heart [19]. Methionine and the methionine cycle are critical for the production of S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM), a major methyl donor [22]. Impairments in the methionine cycle up to 48 hours following radiation have been observed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361 by O’Leary et al. through the suppression of methionine adenosyltranseferase by the long noncoding RNA, PARTICLE [23]. O’leary et al. observed a transient increase in PARTICLE 4 and 24 hours after 0.25 Gy γ-irradiation and a corresponding decrease in SAM 4 hours after radiation [23]. While methionine metabolism directly influences DNA methylation potential, it also plays an important role in redox status. Increases in oxidative stress result in homocysteine, a reversible product in the methionine cycle, to be diverted away from the methionine cycle; thus, 1) decreasing the ability of the cells or tissues to methylate DNA [24] and 2) supporting the synthesis of the antioxidant GSH through the irreversible transsulfuration of methionine [25]. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that exposure to low absorbed doses of space radiation resulted in long-term shifts in the heart tissue methionine concentrations, the ratio of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and DNA methylation [19]. In addition to space radiation as an occupational hazard, microgravity also presents a unique challenge to an astronaut. Microgravity has been shown to play a role in epigenetics, or DNA methylation, in breast cancer cell lines, human lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cells. [26–29]. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress coupled with impairment of antioxidant mechanisms and inflammation have been shown in skeletal muscle following exposure to simulated microgravity [30]. Recently, Mao et al. showed that a combined exposure to hindlimb unloading (HU) and low-dose rate γ-radiation may increase oxidative damage and decrease antioxidant protein content in the mouse brain [31]. To be able to model simultaneous HU and exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation, Mao et al. placed cages of hind-limb unloaded mice onto Co-57 plates that emitted ionizing radiation in the form of γ-rays at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h. Since, the combined effects of low-dose rate radiation exposure and microgravity on the heart are largely unknown, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate indicators of oxidative stress and tissue remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from the mice in the study of Mao et al. [31].",

    "results": "Results Indications of cardiac oxidative stress and anti-oxidant enzyme expression Cardiac tissue GSH (S1 Fig) and GSSG (S2 Fig) levels were assessed and GSH:GSSG ratios were calculated as an indication of oxidative stress (Fig 1). GSH:GSSG ratios were significantly decreased 7 days and 1 month after completion of HU or γ-irradiation. The combination of HU and γ-irradiation showed a further significant decrease in GSH:GSSG ratio than either treatment alone at the 7 day time point (Fig 1A), but not at 1 month (Fig 1B). Statistical analysis did not indicate significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratio in cardiac tissue collected at the 9 month time point (Fig 1C). Despite an early decrease in the GSH:GSSG ratio, no changes were observed in protein 4-HNE adducts as measured by immunoblot analysis (S3 Fig). Fig 1.

Furthermore, no statistical differences were observed in Nrf 2 or catalase protein content at 4 months or 9 months after treatment (S5 Fig). Cardiac methylation potential A small reduction in SAM (S6 Fig) and increase in SAH (S7 Fig) levels in the heart as measured 7 days after completion of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation resulted in a significant reduction in the ratios of SAM:SAH (Fig 2A). The combination of HU and γ-irradiation showed a further reduction in SAM:SAH ratio compared to either HU or γ-irradiation alone (Fig 2A). After 1 month, the SAM:SAH ratio was significantly decreased in all groups compared to CTL, but the combined HU+ γ-irradiation group did not show an additional decrease (Fig 2B). There were no significant differences in SAM:SAH ratio in cardiac tissue collected after 9 months (Fig 2C), or in cardiac methionine content at any time point (S8 Fig). Fig 2.

Cardiac collagen content Since cardiac adverse remodeling typically occurs late after exposure to ionizing radiation, indicators of remodeling and inflammatory infiltration were examined at the observation time points of 4 and 9 months. Histological staining did not reveal significant group differences in total % collagen, in the first series of sections obtained from each heart, the second series, or in a repeated measures analysis of all sections (Fig 3A and 3B). Additionally, both immunoblot and RT-PCR analyses revealed no significant differences 4 or 9 months after treatment in collagen-α1 type III protein content (Fig 3C and 3D) or pro-collagen III relative mRNA (S9 Fig). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of cardiac α-SMC actin did not reveal any significant differences at the 4 or 9 month time points (S10 Fig). Fig 3.

    "discussion": "Discussion The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity and low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation on cardiac tissue. HU was used in this study as it is a widely accepted, terrestrial model of the mechanical unloading and fluid shifts that occur during exposure to microgravity [36,37]. HU was utilized in combination with exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation, in an effort to mimic the effects of a concurrent microgravity and radiation insult on the heart in a ground based model. More specifically, we assessed markers of oxidative stress, DNA methylation, inflammatory cell infiltration and remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from 6 months old female C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month and 9 months after completion of 21 days of HU, 21 days of exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation, or 21 days HU concurrent with 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. This approach allowed us to study the effects of chronic low-dose rate radiation concurrent with HU. The animal model we have employed may also be relevant for low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation as may occur in certain populations on Earth, such as airline crew, miners, or radiological workers. Glutathione, through its oxidation to glutathione disulfide, plays an important role in alleviating oxidative stress and has been used as an index of total tissue oxidative stress [44]. In the present study, GSH:GSSG ratios were decreased both 7 days and 1 month following exposure to HU or γ-irradiation. The data in our current study extend the finding of Sridharan et al., who used an animal model of high-dose local heart irradiation [39], by demonstrating that the GSH:GSSG ratio is sensitive to γ-radiation at a whole body, total low-dose of 0.04 Gy. Our data do not show a greater decrement in GSH:GSSG following 1 month of normal ambulation post-HU and no significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratios between groups were observed 9 months after treatment. The decrease in cardiac tissue GSH:GSSG 7 days and 1 month after irradiation combined with HU suggests that the heart may be more susceptible to oxidative insults. However, other indicators of oxidative stress such as the cardiac expression of Nrf2 and 4-HNE adducts did not significantly change at our measured endpoints, indicating that the hearts were not under severe oxidative stress at those times. Since the first post-treatment time point of analysis was 7 days, we cannot exclude that alterations in Nrf2 and/or 4-HNE may have occurred immediately after completion of HU or γ-irradiation. Moreover, 4-HNE alone is not an optimal indicator of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, future studies would benefit by including additional methods to measure lipid peroxidation, perhaps by malondialdehyde assay. These data suggest that a decrease in left ventricular GSH:GSSG ratios [39] results from an exposure to simulated microgravity or to low-dose/dose-rate γ-radiation, and that the combination of simulated microgravity and γ-irradiation produces a greater affect than either insult alone, measured up to one month after treatment. However, results from later time points suggest that a recovery occurs over the course of several months post-treatment. Although large doses of γ-radiation have been shown to decrease SOD activity in rat hearts [45], low doses of γ radiation may increase SOD activity in some tissues; and SOD levels have been shown to increase in the heart following exposure to simulated microgravity, and further increase after reloading [46]. Proteomic analysis of heart tissue samples of Mayak workers that had been exposed to low doses of γ-radiation over prolonged periods of time showed a decrease in both Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD protein levels in individuals who had received less than 0.1 Gy and individuals who had received more than 0.5 Gy [15]. On the other hand, Casciati et al. reported a decreased anti-oxidant response, including a decrease of Cu/ZnSOD protein content in hippocampus isolated 6 months after 2 Gy cranial x-ray irradiation of 10 day old mice, but not from mice irradiated at the lower dose of 0.1 Gy [47]. Proteomic analysis by Kempf et al. showed that chronic low-dose (0.3 Gy) γ-radiation is not associated with a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, like SOD, but is associated with a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of Apo E-/- mice [48]. The studies by Casciati et al. and Kempf et al. used doses of radiation that were several fold higher than the 0.04 Gy γ-radiation dose used in this study. However, a separate study by Mao et al., in the hippocampus collected from the same mice used in the current study, showed elevated 4-HNE levels 7 days and 9 months after HU or the combination of HU combined with chronic γ-irradiation [31]. Furthermore, Mao et al. also showed a decreased SOD activity 7 days after HU and 9 months after both HU and the combination of HU with γ-irradiation [31]. In contrast, our study of cardiac tissue did not elicit any differences in 4-HNE, GPX 1/2, and only a slight reduction in MnSOD protein content 9 months after γ-irradiation. Taken together, these data indicate that the alterations in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation that occur following HU and low dose-rate γ-irradiation may be tissue specific. Since the anti-oxidant glutathione may be modulated by the methionine cycle [24,25,49], we assessed cardiac methionine levels and SAM:SAH ratios. There were no changes in methionine levels at any time point. However, the SAM:SAH ratio was decreased at the 7 day and 1 month time point, with the combination group showing a further decrement than either HU or γ-irradiation alone. These alterations in the methionine cycle may impair DNA methylation, as suggested by Koturbash et al. [19], and may also contribute to reduced glutathione and potentially result in an increase in oxidative stress at these early time points. High doses of radiation exposure are associated with structural remodeling of the heart, in part through increases in collagen content [1,50,51]. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses suggest that structural remodeling after single, high-dose radiation exposure occurs through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and transforming growth factor beta signaling [52]. Furthermore, structural remodeling of the heart may also occur after exposure to microgravity. For instance, Westby et al. reported a decreased left ventricular mass in subjects following exposure to simulated microgravity via head down tilt that persisted beyond the recovery of other cardiac mal-adaptations associated with simulated microgravity [53]. These results suggest that structural remodeling occurs following radiation exposure and simulated microgravity; however, our study, which used a low-dose, whole body γ-radiation, did not elicit a significant increase of collagen in any group. It is possible that the cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy radiation in the present experiment was too low to elicit the cardiac remodeling that occurs at higher doses [1,50,54]. While we used the same endpoints as previously used in animal models of high-dose radiation exposure, it is possible that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation. We have previously shown that cardiac remodeling due to high-dose x-ray exposure is associated with increased cardiac mast cell numbers [50]. While the current study did not produce a change in mast cell numbers within the mouse heart after 4 months, we did observe a small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content 9 months after low-dose γ-irradiation or a combination of HU + γ-irradiation by immunoblotting, which is likely a more sensitive measure to indicate the presence of mast cells compared to mast cell counts in histological analysis. Nonetheless, current data on collagen deposition and mast cell tryptase do not support the notion that extensive remodeling had occurred. T-lymphocytes are an important modulator of the immune response, are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation [55], and among other inflammatory cells, are associated with cardiovascular disease [56]. Hence, we examined the common T-lymphocyte cell surface marker CD-2 as an indicator of cardiac T-lymphocyte infiltration. Previously, Patties et al. showed increased inflammatory markers 40 weeks after 8 and 16 Gy high-dose rate x-ray irradiation, but no significant differences after a low-dose 2 Gy irradiation [57]. Increased inflammation is associated with decreased cardiac function [58–60]. In contrast to Patties et al., we observed a significant decrease in T-lymphocyte CD-2 protein content 4 months after treatment. The chronic low-dose rate exposures in our study likely induce very different inflammatory responses compared to high-dose rate single dose irradiation. Alternatively, the decreased CD-2 protein content in our study may be reflective of a systemic decrease in T-lymphocytes, which may result in an impaired immune response after exposure to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or a combination of the two, which may recover over time. Space flight is associated with a compromised immune system [61,62], and data from Skylab and shuttle missions indicate a post-flight decrease in lymphocyte cell numbers [63–66]. Microgravity and low-dose rate γ-radiation may be responsible, in part, for the impaired immune function associated with spaceflight [63,65]. Future experiments should include complementary analyses, such as peripheral blood and cardiac T-lymphocyte cell counts. In summary, exposure to 21 days of HU, low-dose γ-irradiation, or a combination HU + low-dose γ-irradiation decreased GSH:GSSG ratios, SAM:SAH ratios, and the inflammatory marker CD-2 protein content. These data suggest that exposure to both low-dose rate radiation and microgravity decreases methylation potential of the heart. The anti-oxidant protein MnSOD showed a small decrease 9 months after exposure to low-dose γ-radiation. However, this difference was not reflected in the other oxidative stress proteins we evaluated. Our analyses of collagen expression and α-SMC actin revealed no significant cardiac remodeling. It is possible that our study was limited by sample size and that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation. Further research is required to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with low-dose rate radiation on cardiac tissue.",

Copyright notice ID: 5498037 PMID: 28678877 Abstract Purpose Space travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation.Methods Cardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.Results The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.Conclusions This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.Introduction Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation may cause cardiac toxicity that involves pericarditis, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1,2]. While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients [3–5], adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure [6–8]. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material [9]. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel. One mechanism by which ionizing radiation may lead to cardiac toxicity is through increased oxidative stress. One characteristic of ionizing radiation is the formation of free radicals, e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10,11]. An increase in oxidative stress has been observed in Russian cosmonauts and in space flown animal models [12–14]. Recently, Azimzadeh et al., demonstrated a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), indicative of an increase in oxidative stress in post-mortem left ventricular tissue from Mayak nuclear workers that had been exposed to low dose-rate γ-radiation [15]. Furthermore, Soucy et al. demonstrated increased activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that generates ROS, in the rat aorta following exposure to 5 Gy γ-radiation [16]. Additionally, mitochondria isolated from mice 4 weeks after 2 Gy local heart X-ray irradiation show an increase in ROS levels when presented with an additional insult [17]. Oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is an important buffering mechanism to reduce ROS levels. Hence, the ratio of tissue levels of GSH to GSSG is used as one indicator of oxidative stress. Another mechanism by which radiation may affect the heart is through DNA methylation, an important mechanism of maintenance of cellular homeostasis [18,19]. Cardiovascular disease is associated with alterations of DNA methylation [20,21]. Moreover, radiation exposure has recently been shown to alter the DNA methylation patterns in the mouse heart [19]. Methionine and the methionine cycle are critical for the production of S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM), a major methyl donor [22]. Impairments in the methionine cycle up to 48 hours following radiation have been observed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361 by O’Leary et al. through the suppression of methionine adenosyltranseferase by the long noncoding RNA, PARTICLE [23]. O’leary et al. observed a transient increase in PARTICLE 4 and 24 hours after 0.25 Gy γ-irradiation and a corresponding decrease in SAM 4 hours after radiation [23]. While methionine metabolism directly influences DNA methylation potential, it also plays an important role in redox status. Increases in oxidative stress result in homocysteine, a reversible product in the methionine cycle, to be diverted away from the methionine cycle; thus, 1) decreasing the ability of the cells or tissues to methylate DNA [24] and 2) supporting the synthesis of the antioxidant GSH through the irreversible transsulfuration of methionine [25]. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that exposure to low absorbed doses of space radiation resulted in long-term shifts in the heart tissue methionine concentrations, the ratio of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and DNA methylation [19]. In addition to space radiation as an occupational hazard, microgravity also presents a unique challenge to an astronaut. Microgravity has been shown to play a role in epigenetics, or DNA methylation, in breast cancer cell lines, human lymphocytes, and lymphoblastoid cells. [26–29]. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress coupled with impairment of antioxidant mechanisms and inflammation have been shown in skeletal muscle following exposure to simulated microgravity [30]. Recently, Mao et al. showed that a combined exposure to hindlimb unloading (HU) and low-dose rate γ-radiation may increase oxidative damage and decrease antioxidant protein content in the mouse brain [31]. To be able to model simultaneous HU and exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation, Mao et al. placed cages of hind-limb unloaded mice onto Co-57 plates that emitted ionizing radiation in the form of γ-rays at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h. Since, the combined effects of low-dose rate radiation exposure and microgravity on the heart are largely unknown, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate indicators of oxidative stress and tissue remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from the mice in the study of Mao et al. [31].Materials and methods Experimental design All mice were handled and sacrificed by our co-author, XW Mao, at Loma Linda University under AUP 8130028 in a previous study [31]. All data were obtained from cardiac tissue samples collected from that previous study. Cardiac tissue samples were obtained from mice in a previous study performed at Loma Linda University under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [31]. Mature (6 months old), female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate γ-irradiation (Co-57), were subjected to HU, or received a simultaneous combination of HU and γ-irradiation (HU+Co-57) for 21 days as previously described [31]. Chronic low-dose rate irradiation was performed by housing mice for 21 days in cages placed on Co-57 plates (GPI; Stoughton, WI), as previously described [32–35]. Co-57 plates had an active area of 16.5 x 24 inches and a dose uniformity of ± 5%. Mice received a cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h. Dose calibration was performed with multiple thermoluminescent dosimeters per cage, as detailed in prior studies [32–35]. Mice were hind-limb unloaded as previously described [36,37]. In short, anti-orthostatic suspension was achieved by attaching a tail harness and suspending mice by the tail harness to elevate the hindquarters above the cage floor with a 30° head-down tilt. Mice remained in HU for the duration of 21 days. After completion of the 21 days of HU, γ-irradiation, or a simultaneous exposure to HU + γ-irradiation, all mice were removed from HU and the radiation source until the time of sacrifice. Mice not undergoing HU or γ-irradiation served as controls (CTL). All mice were provided standard mice chow and water ad libitum and were housed on a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. Mice were allowed normal ambulation after completion of the 21 day treatment period and were sacrificed 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, or 9 months later. Hearts were collected, either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for analysis. Mice were monitored daily during HU, γ-irradiation, or the combined HU+ γ-irradiation treatment and every other day following completion of their 21 day treatment. While the study began with a total 6 animals per group, HU is not always tolerated well by animals, and a total of 4 mice were removed from the study due to significant decreases in body weight (weight loss greater than 15% within 2 weeks). Additional samples were depleted through biochemical analyses, which limited the n size for some of the analyses. Sample size for each experimental group is indicated in Figure legends.High-performance liquid chromatography Markers of oxidative stress and methylation state were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), as previously described [38,39]. Briefly, 50 mg of frozen heart samples were homogenized in 500 μl of phosphate buffered saline solution (4°C). Following homogenization, samples were incubated (4°C; 30 min) in 10% metaphosphoric acid (100 μl tissue homogenate:150 μl acid) and then centrifuged at 18,000g (4°C; 15 min). Supernatant (20 μl) was injected into the HPLC reverse phase C18 Shisheido column (Phenomenex® Inc.) via ESA Autosampler (ESA Inc.). HPLC was performed to assess levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), methionine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and expressed in nmol/mg total protein. Glutathione oxidation was expressed as a ratio of GSH:GSSG and methylation potential was expressed as a ratio of SAM:SAH.Immunoblot analysis Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described [40,41]. In brief, frozen heart samples were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 1% Triton-X100 RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:100) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:100). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4° C and the supernatant removed for analysis. Protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 μg protein was loaded into Criterion TGX 4–20% gradient gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to PVDF membranes. After incubation with 1° and 2° antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat dried milk, membranes were developed using Immobilon™ Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) and CL-Xposure film (Thermo Scientific). Immunoblotting was performed to determine protein content of α-smooth muscle cell (SMC) actin (Abcam; 1:2,000), mast cell tryptase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:25,000), caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:3,000), CD-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:3,000), collagen-α1 type III (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (gifted from Sharda Singh, Ph.D.; 1:10,000), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:20,000), glutathione peroxidase (GPX 1/2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:500), catalase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:20,000). Protein content was determined by densitometry, imaged with an AlphaImager® gel documentation system (ProteinSimple), and quantified with Image Studio Lite. In images where GAPDH showed double banding, both bands were included in the analysis. Protein content of all probed proteins was expressed relative to GAPDH.RNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain reaction RNA isolation and rt-PCR was performed as previously detailed [40,42]. In short, RNA was isolated from frozen heart samples using Ultraspec™ RNA reagent (Biotecx). RNA quality and concentration were assessed spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop® 2000. DNA was removed from the RNA with RQ-DNAse I (Promega), and cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Steady-state mRNA was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Gene expression was assessed using relative quantification (RQ) values obtained from TaqMan Gene Expression Assays™. RQ values were calculated as 2-ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = ΔCTsample− ΔCTcontrol and ΔCT represented the difference in cycle thresholds of a gene of interest and the housekeeping gene (18s rRNA).Fixation and histology Mouse hearts were excised and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (7.4 pH) for 24 hours, rinsed with PBS and dehydrated with ethanol. After dehydration, mouse hearts where embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned (5 μm) for histology, conducted as previously described [39,43]. To assess inflammatory cell infiltration, longitudinal heart sections were rehydrated and incubated with 0.5% Toluidine Blue in 0.5 N HCL for 3 days at room temperature, followed with a 10 minute wash in 0.7 N HCL, and were counterstained with Eosin (1:4). Mast cells were counted using an Axioskop transmitted light microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cardiac remodeling was evaluated by collagen deposition and was determined using Sirius Red/Fast Green staining. Two series of sections were obtained from each heart, with the second series of histology samples sectioned approximately 50 μm deeper into the embedded mouse hearts, to provide a measure of collagen deposition throughout the heart. Heart sections were rehydrated and incubated with Picro Sirius Red supplemented with Fast Green. Sections were scanned using a ScanScope CS2 slide scanner, analyzed with ImageScope 12 (Leica Biosystems), and collagen deposition was determined as a percentage of the total tissue area, i.e. the relative area of collagen (Pico Sirius Red staining) to the total area of the tissue.Statistics All values are means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). NCSS 8 (Kaysville, UT) was used to perform repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on collagen deposition in histology or one-way ANOVA for all other parameters, followed by Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests of differences among individual experimental groups. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. With 6 mice per group, we had 0.80 power to detect a difference of 1.7 SDs between an irradiated and sham group within a time point, based on a .05 significance level t-test conducted within an ANOVA framework. With 3 mice per group, we had 0.80 power to detect a difference of 3.3 SDs. Here, SD is the root mean square error from the ANOVA.Results Indications of cardiac oxidative stress and anti-oxidant enzyme expression Cardiac tissue GSH (S1 Fig) and GSSG (S2 Fig) levels were assessed and GSH:GSSG ratios were calculated as an indication of oxidative stress (Fig 1). GSH:GSSG ratios were significantly decreased 7 days and 1 month after completion of HU or γ-irradiation. The combination of HU and γ-irradiation showed a further significant decrease in GSH:GSSG ratio than either treatment alone at the 7 day time point (Fig 1A), but not at 1 month (Fig 1B). Statistical analysis did not indicate significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratio in cardiac tissue collected at the 9 month time point (Fig 1C). Despite an early decrease in the GSH:GSSG ratio, no changes were observed in protein 4-HNE adducts as measured by immunoblot analysis (S3 Fig). Fig 1.

Values are means ± SEM. * Significantly different than CTL, p < 0.05; t Significantly different than HU, p < 0.05; # Significantly different than 57Co, p < 0.05.A small reduction in cardiac MnSOD expression was observed 9 months after low-dose rate irradiation, but no alterations were seen in MnSOD at 4 months, or GPX 1/2 at 4 or 9 months (S4 Fig). Furthermore, no statistical differences were observed in Nrf 2 or catalase protein content at 4 months or 9 months after treatment (S5 Fig).Cardiac methylation potential A small reduction in SAM (S6 Fig) and increase in SAH (S7 Fig) levels in the heart as measured 7 days after completion of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation resulted in a significant reduction in the ratios of SAM:SAH (Fig 2A). The combination of HU and γ-irradiation showed a further reduction in SAM:SAH ratio compared to either HU or γ-irradiation alone (Fig 2A). After 1 month, the SAM:SAH ratio was significantly decreased in all groups compared to CTL, but the combined HU+ γ-irradiation group did not show an additional decrease (Fig 2B). There were no significant differences in SAM:SAH ratio in cardiac tissue collected after 9 months (Fig 2C), or in cardiac methionine content at any time point (S8 Fig). Fig 2.

Histological staining did not reveal significant group differences in total % collagen, in the first series of sections obtained from each heart, the second series, or in a repeated measures analysis of all sections (Fig 3A and 3B). Additionally, both immunoblot and RT-PCR analyses revealed no significant differences 4 or 9 months after treatment in collagen-α1 type III protein content (Fig 3C and 3D) or pro-collagen III relative mRNA (S9 Fig). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of cardiac α-SMC actin did not reveal any significant differences at the 4 or 9 month time points (S10 Fig). Fig 3.

Values are means ± SEM. Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant differences.Cardiac T-lymphocyte infiltration and mast cell numbers Mast cells were examined by histological staining with Toluidine Blue and by measuring mast cell tryptase content through immunoblot analysis. Histology did not reveal any significant differences in mast cell counts (Fig 4A and 4B); however, a small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content was seen at 9 months after low-dose rate γ-radiation with and without HU (Fig 4C and 4D).

A significant decrease in CD-2 protein content was detected in all treatment groups compared to CTL in cardiac tissue collected 4 months after completion of HU, low-dose rate γ-irradiation or a combination of the two, but not in cardiac tissue collected at 9 months (Fig 4E and 4F).Discussion The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity and low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation on cardiac tissue. HU was used in this study as it is a widely accepted, terrestrial model of the mechanical unloading and fluid shifts that occur during exposure to microgravity [36,37]. HU was utilized in combination with exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation, in an effort to mimic the effects of a concurrent microgravity and radiation insult on the heart in a ground based model. More specifically, we assessed markers of oxidative stress, DNA methylation, inflammatory cell infiltration and remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from 6 months old female C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month and 9 months after completion of 21 days of HU, 21 days of exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation, or 21 days HU concurrent with 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. This approach allowed us to study the effects of chronic low-dose rate radiation concurrent with HU. The animal model we have employed may also be relevant for low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation as may occur in certain populations on Earth, such as airline crew, miners, or radiological workers. Glutathione, through its oxidation to glutathione disulfide, plays an important role in alleviating oxidative stress and has been used as an index of total tissue oxidative stress [44]. In the present study, GSH:GSSG ratios were decreased both 7 days and 1 month following exposure to HU or γ-irradiation. The data in our current study extend the finding of Sridharan et al., who used an animal model of high-dose local heart irradiation [39], by demonstrating that the GSH:GSSG ratio is sensitive to γ-radiation at a whole body, total low-dose of 0.04 Gy. Our data do not show a greater decrement in GSH:GSSG following 1 month of normal ambulation post-HU and no significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratios between groups were observed 9 months after treatment. The decrease in cardiac tissue GSH:GSSG 7 days and 1 month after irradiation combined with HU suggests that the heart may be more susceptible to oxidative insults. However, other indicators of oxidative stress such as the cardiac expression of Nrf2 and 4-HNE adducts did not significantly change at our measured endpoints, indicating that the hearts were not under severe oxidative stress at those times. Since the first post-treatment time point of analysis was 7 days, we cannot exclude that alterations in Nrf2 and/or 4-HNE may have occurred immediately after completion of HU or γ-irradiation. Moreover, 4-HNE alone is not an optimal indicator of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, future studies would benefit by including additional methods to measure lipid peroxidation, perhaps by malondialdehyde assay. These data suggest that a decrease in left ventricular GSH:GSSG ratios [39] results from an exposure to simulated microgravity or to low-dose/dose-rate γ-radiation, and that the combination of simulated microgravity and γ-irradiation produces a greater affect than either insult alone, measured up to one month after treatment. However, results from later time points suggest that a recovery occurs over the course of several months post-treatment. Although large doses of γ-radiation have been shown to decrease SOD activity in rat hearts [45], low doses of γ radiation may increase SOD activity in some tissues; and SOD levels have been shown to increase in the heart following exposure to simulated microgravity, and further increase after reloading [46]. Proteomic analysis of heart tissue samples of Mayak workers that had been exposed to low doses of γ-radiation over prolonged periods of time showed a decrease in both Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD protein levels in individuals who had received less than 0.1 Gy and individuals who had received more than 0.5 Gy [15]. On the other hand, Casciati et al. reported a decreased anti-oxidant response, including a decrease of Cu/ZnSOD protein content in hippocampus isolated 6 months after 2 Gy cranial x-ray irradiation of 10 day old mice, but not from mice irradiated at the lower dose of 0.1 Gy [47]. Proteomic analysis by Kempf et al. showed that chronic low-dose (0.3 Gy) γ-radiation is not associated with a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, like SOD, but is associated with a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of Apo E-/- mice [48]. The studies by Casciati et al. and Kempf et al. used doses of radiation that were several fold higher than the 0.04 Gy γ-radiation dose used in this study. However, a separate study by Mao et al., in the hippocampus collected from the same mice used in the current study, showed elevated 4-HNE levels 7 days and 9 months after HU or the combination of HU combined with chronic γ-irradiation [31]. Furthermore, Mao et al. also showed a decreased SOD activity 7 days after HU and 9 months after both HU and the combination of HU with γ-irradiation [31]. In contrast, our study of cardiac tissue did not elicit any differences in 4-HNE, GPX 1/2, and only a slight reduction in MnSOD protein content 9 months after γ-irradiation. Taken together, these data indicate that the alterations in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation that occur following HU and low dose-rate γ-irradiation may be tissue specific. Since the anti-oxidant glutathione may be modulated by the methionine cycle [24,25,49], we assessed cardiac methionine levels and SAM:SAH ratios. There were no changes in methionine levels at any time point. However, the SAM:SAH ratio was decreased at the 7 day and 1 month time point, with the combination group showing a further decrement than either HU or γ-irradiation alone. These alterations in the methionine cycle may impair DNA methylation, as suggested by Koturbash et al. [19], and may also contribute to reduced glutathione and potentially result in an increase in oxidative stress at these early time points. High doses of radiation exposure are associated with structural remodeling of the heart, in part through increases in collagen content [1,50,51]. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses suggest that structural remodeling after single, high-dose radiation exposure occurs through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and transforming growth factor beta signaling [52]. Furthermore, structural remodeling of the heart may also occur after exposure to microgravity. For instance, Westby et al. reported a decreased left ventricular mass in subjects following exposure to simulated microgravity via head down tilt that persisted beyond the recovery of other cardiac mal-adaptations associated with simulated microgravity [53]. These results suggest that structural remodeling occurs following radiation exposure and simulated microgravity; however, our study, which used a low-dose, whole body γ-radiation, did not elicit a significant increase of collagen in any group. It is possible that the cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy radiation in the present experiment was too low to elicit the cardiac remodeling that occurs at higher doses [1,50,54]. While we used the same endpoints as previously used in animal models of high-dose radiation exposure, it is possible that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation. We have previously shown that cardiac remodeling due to high-dose x-ray exposure is associated with increased cardiac mast cell numbers [50]. While the current study did not produce a change in mast cell numbers within the mouse heart after 4 months, we did observe a small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content 9 months after low-dose γ-irradiation or a combination of HU + γ-irradiation by immunoblotting, which is likely a more sensitive measure to indicate the presence of mast cells compared to mast cell counts in histological analysis. Nonetheless, current data on collagen deposition and mast cell tryptase do not support the notion that extensive remodeling had occurred. T-lymphocytes are an important modulator of the immune response, are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation [55], and among other inflammatory cells, are associated with cardiovascular disease [56]. Hence, we examined the common T-lymphocyte cell surface marker CD-2 as an indicator of cardiac T-lymphocyte infiltration. Previously, Patties et al. showed increased inflammatory markers 40 weeks after 8 and 16 Gy high-dose rate x-ray irradiation, but no significant differences after a low-dose 2 Gy irradiation [57]. Increased inflammation is associated with decreased cardiac function [58–60]. In contrast to Patties et al., we observed a significant decrease in T-lymphocyte CD-2 protein content 4 months after treatment. The chronic low-dose rate exposures in our study likely induce very different inflammatory responses compared to high-dose rate single dose irradiation. Alternatively, the decreased CD-2 protein content in our study may be reflective of a systemic decrease in T-lymphocytes, which may result in an impaired immune response after exposure to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or a combination of the two, which may recover over time. Space flight is associated with a compromised immune system [61,62], and data from Skylab and shuttle missions indicate a post-flight decrease in lymphocyte cell numbers [63–66]. Microgravity and low-dose rate γ-radiation may be responsible, in part, for the impaired immune function associated with spaceflight [63,65]. Future experiments should include complementary analyses, such as peripheral blood and cardiac T-lymphocyte cell counts. In summary, exposure to 21 days of HU, low-dose γ-irradiation, or a combination HU + low-dose γ-irradiation decreased GSH:GSSG ratios, SAM:SAH ratios, and the inflammatory marker CD-2 protein content. These data suggest that exposure to both low-dose rate radiation and microgravity decreases methylation potential of the heart. The anti-oxidant protein MnSOD showed a small decrease 9 months after exposure to low-dose γ-radiation. However, this difference was not reflected in the other oxidative stress proteins we evaluated. Our analyses of collagen expression and α-SMC actin revealed no significant cardiac remodeling. It is possible that our study was limited by sample size and that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation. Further research is required to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with low-dose rate radiation on cardiac tissue.Supporting information S1 Fig. GSH concentration in mouse heart following HU, γ irradiation or combined HU + γ irradiation.HPLC was utilized to determine methionine concentration in mouse heart a.) 7 days, b.) 1 month, or c.) 9 month after a 21 day exposure to HU, γ irradiation (57Co: 0.01 cGy/h; 0.04 Gy total), or a combined HU + γ irradiation.

    "title": "Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547757/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. Subject terms: Proteomic analysis, Molecular neuroscience",
    "introduction": "Introduction Astronaut health and safety are of key importance to the success of long-term missions in space. More than 50% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) have reported a subjective change in their visual acuity1. The underlying mechanisms and pathological manifestations of increased vision impairment during and after spaceflight is currently unknown. Various factors have been suggested to account for these disturbances, including increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the cerebrovascular barrier function would serve to elevate ICP2. Similar to how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions in the cranium, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an endothelial barrier which regulates vascular permeability and maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). Little work has been done to examine retinal structure and BRB integrity/function following prolonged exposure to spaceflight in animal models. Spaceflight has been reported to have numerous negative effects on ocular and structure and function3. However, data on how spaceflight impacts protein expression in the retina are limited. We have previously evaluated ocular tissue responses obtained from mice flown to and from the ISS on both the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135)4 as well as the SpaceX-9 Dragon rocket5. Although numerous differences were noted in the flight mice compared to control animals on ground, an intriguing finding especially relevant to the present study was that spaceflight conditions induced significant changes in protein expression related to endothelial apoptosis, inflammation and metabolic function in the retina. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and BRB integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a proteomics approach.",
    "methods": "Material and Methods Flight and control conditions On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay.

Post-flight evaluation of the mice Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to LLU within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized. IOP measurement Before launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse45. This process was repeated three times for each eye. Eye and retina preparation after spaceflight The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown (n = 20/group). The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: GC and FLT were dissected to obtain the retina, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for proteomics analysis. TUNEL assay The ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. Briefly, six μm paraffin embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (Catalog No. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina per section. Immunohistochemistry for AQP-4 and vascular double-labeling Six μm sections were incubated overnight (18–21 hours) at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP-4 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX) and monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clone GA5 (1:1000, Millipore, Burlington, MA) in 0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and further treated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections. Immunostaining assays for PECAM-1 and ZO-1 Immunofluorescence staining related to BRB integrity on ocular sections was performed using biomarkers against PECAM-1 and ZO-1. Six µm sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated and washed in PBS for 20 minutes. For enzymatic antigen retrieval, sections were incubated in 1 mg/ml Actinase E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 20 minutes at 37 °C, rinsed in running tap water for 3 minutes and washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Sections were then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 10 minutes wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (1:50) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) or CD31/PECAM-1 (1:100) (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO) in antibody dilution buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 hours with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS; Life Technologies) washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections. Quantification of Immunostaining For quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells and TUNEL positive endothelial cells were counted separately. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted in 5 sections from each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.4 software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. To determine AQP4, ZO-1 and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6 to 10 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group. Proteomics analysis A total of 12 frozen retinas from 2 experimental groups (GC and FLT, n = 6 mice per group) were shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for proteomics analysis. Protein lysates were prepared and 20 μg of protein lysate were resolved in a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gel was cut into 12 thick gel slices (2 mm thick) for each sample and an in-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described in (Mao et al. 2018). Briefly, gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 100 mM. Once destained, the proteins were reduced in 10 mM Tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX) and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were prepared for trypsin digestion by dehydrating in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An overnight trypsin digestion was performed by the addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce Corp.) to stop the trypsin reaction. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a 200 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 minute gradient from 97:3 to 65:35 buffer A: B ratio. [Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] The peptide eluents were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV), MS1 peptides were detected and subjected to MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Corp.) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0. Bioinformatic analysis of proteomics data Proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16, Max Planck Institute). MS/MS spectra were submitted to MaxQuant for database searching using the UniProtKB database (2018-06 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries). MS1 iBAQ protein intensities were obtained by performing a MS1 reporter type database search with trypsin digestion including up to three missed cleavages. Modifications included both fixed modifications (carbamidomethyl of cysteine) and variable modifications (oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus). The first search was set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance for a search against a contaminants database in order to identify commonly identified contaminants, such as keratin proteins. The main search against the mouse database was set to 3 ppm. Label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1 was selected to obtain the MS1 intensity values. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold46. The MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were median normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median (sample FLT 5). Median normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Principal Component Analysis was performed on the normalized data set and a batch effect was detected among replicates due to sample processing (data not shown). The batch effect was corrected using the R function ComBat from the SVA Bioconductor package7. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney u tests were used to compare the ground GC and FLT sample groups. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Bioconductor R package ComplexHeatmap with the Euclidean distance metric and the clustering method set to complete47. Volcano plots were generated using R base function plot (R version 3.4.4). These significant proteins were then analyzed using IPA (QIAGEN Inc., Frederick, MD). Statistical analysis The results obtained from IOP measurements, TUNEL assay and IHC were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. The statistical analysis of proteomics results is described above.",
    "results": "Results IOP measurement Tukey’s post hoc comparison showed that IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg, p < 0.05) in the left eye of the flight (FLT) mice (Fig. 1A). However, there were no significant differences in IOP measurements in the right eye (Fig. 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. (A) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice for left eyes (n = 20). (B) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for FLT and GC mice for right eyes (n = 20). The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Three IOP measurements were obtained for each eye. Values are means ± SEM. *Significantly lower than that of preflight (p < 0.05). Apoptotic damage in the retina Representative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were presented for FLT, habitat ground controls (GC) and vivarium control conditions, including both flight vivarium (FV) and ground vivarium (GV) control groups (Fig. 2A). Quantitative assessment indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly higher in the FLT group, and was 2–2.5 fold higher compared to that in the GC group (Fig. 2B). The number of TUNEL positive endothelial cells were also calculated (Fig. 2C). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells was detected ranging from 1.6 to 2.0-fold for FLT group compared to ground and vivarium controls, respectively (p < 0.05). Figure 2.

(A) TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (red). TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only sparse TUNEL-positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, TUNEL-positive labeling was apparent in the retinal endothelial cells, nuclear layers and ganglion cell layers. Arrow: TUNEL-positive endothelial cell.

Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group, and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group. *Significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05). BRB integrity and endothelial proteins Two astrocyte markers were used to examine the integrity of the BRB: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4). GFAP is present in the cell bodies and large processes of astrocytes. It is an intermediate filament protein involved in the maintenance of the BRB. (Fig. 3A). AQP-4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet which clearly outline the vascular bed to which they adhere. In the retina, AQP4 is expressed in glia cells (astrocyte and Müller cells) and is responible for BRB integrity. Increased positive AQP4 staining (green) was seen in the retinal GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL) of the FLT group (Fig. 3A) compared with ground controls. As shown in Fig. 3B, the fluorescent intensity reflecting endogenous levels of AQP-4 in the retina was significantly greater in the FLT group compared with the GC group (p < 0.01). There was no signficant differences between three control groups; the average intensities were 36.9 +/− 3.0, 34.9 +/− 1.9 and 35.1 +/− 3.6 for the GC, GV and FV groups respectively. There was no notable difference in the pattern and instensity of GFAP staining. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) staining in the retina. (A) Representative micrographs of ocular sections after immunostaining with anti-GFAP and AQP-4 antibodies on flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. AQP-4 positive staining is identified by green fluorescence, GFAP with red, and the cell nuclei with blue (DAPI). Increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the FLT group compared with controls. No significant differences in GFAP staining was noted between two groups. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) The average fluorescence intensity for AQP-4 was measured and calculated using the ImageJ program. Fluorescence was averaged across 6 retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM. *Significantly higher than ground control (GC) groups (p < 0.05).To examine whether spaceflight alters cellular expression of the endothelial cell juction proteins and retinal barrier integrity, the eye tissue expression of the endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were evaluated. In FLT mice, increased immunoreactivity for PECAM-1 (red) was predominantly present in GCL (Fig. 4A). PECAM-1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the FLT group compared to GC mice (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, ZO-1 expression (red) was detected at the GCL and the photorecepotor inner segment (IS) of the eye tissues (Fig. 5A). The level of ZO-1 immunoactivity tended to be lower (p = 0.062) in the FLT group compared to that in GC controls (Fig. 5B). Figure 4.

PECAM-1 positive cells were identified with red fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (green). The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layers (GCL). Scale bar = 50 μm.

Proteomics analysis of mouse ocular tissues Twenty micrograms of protein from retina samples in the GC and FLT groups were resolved by 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-Gly gel electrophoresis, visualized by Coomassie stain, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by LC/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. A MaxQuant database search (restricted to Mus musculus) identified a total of 6,634 proteins from all 12 samples with 6,353 (96%) proteins identified in common among the GC and FLT samples (Fig. 6). MaxQuant iBAQ intensity values were median normalized, log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution using Perseus (version 1.5.6.0)6. Batch effects were corrected using the ComBat function from the sva bioconductor package7. The log2 normalized iBAQ intensity values were used for statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR level. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Venn diagram of the total number of proteins identified in the retinas of ground control and flight mice. 95.8% of the proteins were identified in both groups, while 2.7% and 1.6% of proteins identified were unique to ground control and flight, respectively.We identified a total of 6,634 proteins of which 485 significantly differentiated in FLT compared to GC by FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1). These proteins are shown as a heatmap using a hierarchical cluster of the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities for all samples (Fig. 7). The significant protein profile is able to clearly separate the two groups. This list was then reduced to 224 significant proteins when we included a fold change >2 cutoff (Supplementary Table 2). Volcano plots were generated to visualize all identified proteins and highlight significant proteins. The y-axis consists of −log10 p-values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted p-values, while the x-axis consists of the log2 fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a p-value of 0.05 (Fig. 8). A total of 126 proteins were up-regulated while 98 proteins were down-regulated in FLT compared to GC. Ten most significantly increased and decreased protein expression levels related to cellular organization, cell cycle, apoptosis, circadian clock, neuronal and mitochondrial function are summarized and listed in Table 1. These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis)8. Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). IPA revealed significant changes in pathways related to cell death, adhesion juction/tight junction signaling, calcium signaling, mitochondrial function and metabolism. Significantly affected canonical pathways between GC and FLT groups are shown in Fig. 9. Figure 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the retinal vasculature and possible alterations in BRB integrity, and to identify spaceflight-induced proteomic significance and biomarkers in mouse ocular tissue. The data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in the retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors (Fig. 2), as well as evokes alterations in vascular levels of AQP-4 (Fig. 3), PECAM-1 (Fig. 4) and ZO-1 (Fig. 5), proteins related to BRB integrity. These changes in BRB characteristics suggest decrements in barrier function in the eye. Protein expression profiles and pathway analysis also provide evidence that spaceflight induces changes in cellular organization, cell cycle, mitochondrial function, circadian clock and oxidative stress in the retina. Collectively, these observations are consistent with and extend previous findings in rodents exposed to a weightless environment4,5 and suggest that spaceflight involves a complex combination of stressors that leads to alterations and impairment of ocular structure and function. Little is known about the impact of spaceflight on the BRB, but in disease states such as diabetes, where the BRB is compromised and microvascular permeability is elevated, visual impairment similar to the visual disturbances experienced by astronauts often occurs9,10. At least one recent study has shown that a compromise in the integrity of the vascular BRB causes vision-threatening vascular dysfunction11. Damage to microvascular endothelial cells is one of the major factors thought to underlie the increased permeability of the BRB in diabetic patients9,10. Radiation, another environmental stressor inherent to spaceflight, also induces disruption of endothelial barrier integrity12,13. In the present study, we found the spaceflight induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1. The water channel protein AQP-4 has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet membranes14. The upregulation of AQP-4 in flight retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential for barrier integrity disruption and edema formation. PECAM-1 is highly expressed at endothelial cell-cell junctions, where it functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to maintain endothelial cell junctional integrity15. It is important for leukocyte-endothelium interactions, including the migration of leukocytes across the endothelium during inflammation16. PECAM-1 has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular degeneration17. Increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, including PECAM-1, has also been associated with BRB disruption after retinal vascular injury18. The higher PECAM-1 expression in retina following spaceflight may consequently facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to prolonged changes in the BRB permeability19. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on TJs, and possibly adherent junctions, among endothelial cells20. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-121. Indeed, the degradation of TJ-associated proteins in retinal vessels following injury has been shown to lead to retinal vascular disorganization and BRB breakdown14. We found a tendency for a lower expression of TJ-associated protein ZO-1, which is mostly expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells22. The greater apoptosis of retinal vascular endothelial cells coupled with alterations in retinal vascular AQP-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1 levels in FLT mice collectively suggest that spaceflight increases the risk for BRB disruption, leading to possible ocular impairment and injury. After returning from long-duration spaceflight missions, many astronauts have been diagnosed with ocular structural and visual changes23. Studies have shown that changes in the gravitational environment can have pronounced transient and sustained effects on the eye24. Microgravity-induced vision changes may result from the interaction of multiple physiological factors, including changes in IOP, fluid shifts, ocular geometry and cardiovascular alterations25–27. Similarly, increases in IOP have been documented in ground-based models of spaceflight, such as head-down tilt28. As part of this study, we assessed IOP before and after spaceflight in fully conscious mice. Given the current evidence that BRB integrity is compromised by spaceflight (Figs 2–5), it was surprising to find a significant decrease in post-flight IOP in one eye of the FLT mice (Fig. 1) rather than an increase. There are several possible explanations for this apparent paradox. The first is whether the lower IOP in the left eye of FLT mice was biologically significant. The pre- and post-flight difference in the mean IOP of the left eye in the FLT mice was slightly less than 1 mmHg (Fig. 1). Likewise, the pre- and post-flight difference in the mean IOP of the left eye in the GC mice was also slightly less than 1 mmHg, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1). This suggests that a ± 1 mmHg margin may be within the biological variability of the measure in mice. This, along with the lack of difference in the pre- and post-flight IOP of the right eye in the FLT mice, indicates that spaceflight had little to no significant biological effect on IOP measured approximately 1 day after returning to Earth. In this instance, it is also possible that BRB disruption and increases vascular permeability may contribute to the pathology of the visual disturbances, like those experienced by astronauts, without increases of IOP. Second, it is possible that spaceflight-induced increases in IOP are transient and no longer evident 28 hours after splash down. Confirmation of this possibility requires further measures of IOP during spaceflight. A third possible explanation for the apparent paradox of BRB disruption with no increase in IOP is that the magnitude of BRB alterations found with 35 days of spaceflight were not sufficient to elicit elevations in IOP. And finally, the disruption of BRB integrity coupled with the hemodynamic response to spaceflight in mice may have been insufficient to evoke an increase in IOP. For example, spaceflight in humans is thought to induce a cephalad fluid shift that can affect the flow and fluid pressures within the extracranial, intracranial and intraocular circulations, as well as within the cerebrospinal and aqueous humor fluid systems29. Similar cephalad fluid shifts have also been described in the hindlimb unloaded rat30–32, a ground-based rodent model to simulate a weightless environment. However, mice have a negligible hydrostatic pressure gradient on Earth owing to their small body size and do not show the same shifts in fluid volume during hindlimb unloading as that found in rats33. Additionally, during 30 days of spaceflight on the Bion-M1 satellite, mean arterial blood pressure in the aortic arch of mice is not altered34, and arteries in the head and hindlimbs of mice flown on the Bion-M1 and Space Shuttle do not show any structural remodeling to indicate chronic changes in fluid pressure associated with a cephalad fluid shift26,27,35. Thus, an impairment of BRB integrity in the eyes of mice during spaceflight may not result in an increase in IOP due to the lack of a cephalad fluid shift, as might be reasonably expected to occur in astronauts. This observation highlights one of the major limitations of utilizing mice to study the effects of spaceflight on bodily function instead of the rat. Proteomic analysis of the retina, optic disc and optic nerve also suggests that spaceflight has adverse effects on the eye. For example, proteomics analysis revealed that SCY 3-like protein (SCYL3), also known as the protein-associating with the C-terminal domain of Ezrin (PACE-1), was the most down-regulated protein in the flight mice compared to controls. SCYL3 is proposed to regulate membrane protein or lipid trafficking at the Golgi and plasma membrane36. More recent studies have shown that SCYL3 plays an important role in regulating neuronal function and survival in mice and humans37,38. Pleiotrophin (PTN), also known as heparin-binding brain mitogen (HBBM), is one of the most up-regulated proteins in our proteomic analysis. This protein is found predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), where it likely plays a role in tumor development including differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion, apoptosis and metastasis39. Many proteins that are associated with ophthalmic disease and injuries were significantly altered by spaceflight, including proteins in the crystallins family (CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYGA and CRYBA1). These proteins are important in contributing to retinal ganglion cell survival40. Reduced expression of these proteins may indicate increased risk for developing visual diseases. Figure 10 illustrates regulation and interaction of network of proteins responsible for ophthalmic disease and abnormalities as defined by IPA in response to spaceflight. Figure 10.

Circadian rhythms recur regularly over an approximately 24-hour cycle affecting many aspects of biological processes in living beings ranging from tiny microbes to higher order animals, including humans41. In this study, the expression of CRY1, also known as cryptochrome, an important clock protein, was significantly down regulated by spaceflight. A recent study showed that CRY encodes a critical circadian photoreceptor42. Findings indicate that CRY regulates the light-mediated entrainment and the daily rhythms of locomotion43,44. The overall results obtained in control mice showed there were no significant differences among GC, FV and GV control groups, suggesting that the time difference between tissue collection for the flight and ground cohorts did not have a significant impact on the measured endpoints. Therefore, we focused on comparisons between FLT and GC groups for most IHC assessments and the proteomics analysis, since these two groups shared the same flight hardware for housing and consumed the same food specially made for spaceflight. Additionally, the GC mice were exposed to the same environmental parameters as the FLT animals, including temperature, humidity and CO2 levels that were matched to the spaceflight condition. Because of logistical limitations of spaceflight experiment, mouse IOP was measured and euthanasia was performed 28–38 hours after splashdown. We understand this to be a limitation of the study for all measured parameters in evaluating spaceflight-induced changes. However, we speculate that the structural and proteomic changes observed would be minimally affected by the time delay because protein expression is relatively stable and often requires days to weeks to be altered in response to environmental changes. In contrast, fluid pressures such as IOP can change in a matter of seconds to minutes. In a previous investigation we reported the impact of 35 days of spaceflight on the mouse retina in animals which were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS5. Results from the current paper are in agree with this previous study that spaceflight induces significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells and some proteins and pathways associated with cell death, inflammation and metabolic stress were significantly altered following spaceflight Additionally, the current finding examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced changes and provide strong evidence that spaceflight impacts BRB integrity. However, the proteomics analysis showed limited overlap of significant differentiating proteins and pathways between these two flight studies. For example, in the prior study with JAXA mice there were alterations in the glycogen degradation, fatty acid β oxidation and DNA methylation and transcription pathways of the flight mice that were not identified in the current study. In contrast, changes in the actin cytoskeleton, tight junction, and epithelial adherens pathways were significantly altered with spaceflight in the present study that were not observed in the JAXA flight mice. Some contrasting proteomic results between the two flight studies may not be surprising since several experimental conditions were different. First, for the JAXA mouse study, the posterior half of the right eyecup containing the retinal layer, optic disc and a short segment of the optic nerve was used for proteomic analysis, whereas the eye sample evaluated in the current study only contained the retinal layer. And secondly, 9-week old C57BL/6 male mice were used for the JAXA flight study, and the flight animals and control animals were obtained from breeding colonies in the United States and Japan, respectively. It is possible, although unlikely, that some of the differences in the proteomic results between flight and control animals reflected differences in mice from the two different breeding colonies. The RR-9 mice were obtained from the same US breeding colony. Thus, we believe that differences in the effects of spaceflight on protein expression and pathways in the eyes of mice between the previous JAXA study5 and the current study primarily reflect differences in the composition of the eye samples tested. Such differences may be important in guiding our understanding of the regional effects of spaceflight in the eye. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that exposure to a spaceflight environment is associated with increased retinal endothelial cells and photoreceptor cell death. In addition, there were alterations in the retinal microvasculature BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell organization, circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered. Multiple factors could be responsible for the changes observed in the FLT mice, including 35 days of weightlessness, increased radiation exposure, and distress associated with live return through the Earth’s atmosphere, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, transport to the LLU laboratory, and approximately 38 hours of re-exposure to Earth’s gravity. The data further indicate that astronauts may be at risk for retinal damage and late degeneration. Such findings may also help facilitate the development and testing of more effective countermeasures for human spaceflight and planetary exploration.",

Copyright notice ID: 6547757 PMID: 31160660 Abstract The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. Subject terms: Proteomic analysis, Molecular neuroscienceIntroduction Astronaut health and safety are of key importance to the success of long-term missions in space. More than 50% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) have reported a subjective change in their visual acuity1. The underlying mechanisms and pathological manifestations of increased vision impairment during and after spaceflight is currently unknown. Various factors have been suggested to account for these disturbances, including increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the cerebrovascular barrier function would serve to elevate ICP2. Similar to how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions in the cranium, the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is an endothelial barrier which regulates vascular permeability and maintains intraocular pressure (IOP). Little work has been done to examine retinal structure and BRB integrity/function following prolonged exposure to spaceflight in animal models. Spaceflight has been reported to have numerous negative effects on ocular and structure and function3. However, data on how spaceflight impacts protein expression in the retina are limited. We have previously evaluated ocular tissue responses obtained from mice flown to and from the ISS on both the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135)4 as well as the SpaceX-9 Dragon rocket5. Although numerous differences were noted in the flight mice compared to control animals on ground, an intriguing finding especially relevant to the present study was that spaceflight conditions induced significant changes in protein expression related to endothelial apoptosis, inflammation and metabolic function in the retina. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on retinal vascular alterations and BRB integrity, and to identify changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue following spaceflight using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a proteomics approach.Results IOP measurement Tukey’s post hoc comparison showed that IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg, p < 0.05) in the left eye of the flight (FLT) mice (Fig. 1A). However, there were no significant differences in IOP measurements in the right eye (Fig. 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. (A) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice for left eyes (n = 20). (B) Mean pre-and post-flight IOP for FLT and GC mice for right eyes (n = 20). The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Three IOP measurements were obtained for each eye. Values are means ± SEM. *Significantly lower than that of preflight (p < 0.05).Apoptotic damage in the retina Representative images of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were presented for FLT, habitat ground controls (GC) and vivarium control conditions, including both flight vivarium (FV) and ground vivarium (GV) control groups (Fig. 2A). Quantitative assessment indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly higher in the FLT group, and was 2–2.5 fold higher compared to that in the GC group (Fig. 2B). The number of TUNEL positive endothelial cells were also calculated (Fig. 2C). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells was detected ranging from 1.6 to 2.0-fold for FLT group compared to ground and vivarium controls, respectively (p < 0.05). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Apoptosis based on terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of male C57BL/6 flight (FLT), ground control (GC) mouse retinal tissue. (A) TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (red). TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only sparse TUNEL-positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, TUNEL-positive labeling was apparent in the retinal endothelial cells, nuclear layers and ganglion cell layers. Arrow: TUNEL-positive endothelial cell. Outer nuclear layer (ONL); inner nuclear layer (INL); ganglion cell layer (GCL). Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Apoptotic cell density in the retinal ONL, INL and GCL of ground vivarium (GV), Ground control (GC), flight vivarium (FV) and Flight (FLT) mice; (C) Apoptotic cell density in the retinal endothelium of GV, GC, FV and FLT mice. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group, and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM for 6 mice/group. *Significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05).BRB integrity and endothelial proteins Two astrocyte markers were used to examine the integrity of the BRB: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4). GFAP is present in the cell bodies and large processes of astrocytes. It is an intermediate filament protein involved in the maintenance of the BRB. (Fig. 3A). AQP-4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet which clearly outline the vascular bed to which they adhere. In the retina, AQP4 is expressed in glia cells (astrocyte and Müller cells) and is responible for BRB integrity. Increased positive AQP4 staining (green) was seen in the retinal GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL) of the FLT group (Fig. 3A) compared with ground controls. As shown in Fig. 3B, the fluorescent intensity reflecting endogenous levels of AQP-4 in the retina was significantly greater in the FLT group compared with the GC group (p < 0.01). There was no signficant differences between three control groups; the average intensities were 36.9 +/− 3.0, 34.9 +/− 1.9 and 35.1 +/− 3.6 for the GC, GV and FV groups respectively. There was no notable difference in the pattern and instensity of GFAP staining. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) staining in the retina. (A) Representative micrographs of ocular sections after immunostaining with anti-GFAP and AQP-4 antibodies on flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. AQP-4 positive staining is identified by green fluorescence, GFAP with red, and the cell nuclei with blue (DAPI). Increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the FLT group compared with controls. No significant differences in GFAP staining was noted between two groups. Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) The average fluorescence intensity for AQP-4 was measured and calculated using the ImageJ program. Fluorescence was averaged across 6 retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM. *Significantly higher than ground control (GC) groups (p < 0.05).To examine whether spaceflight alters cellular expression of the endothelial cell juction proteins and retinal barrier integrity, the eye tissue expression of the endothelial cell-cell adhesion molecule, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were evaluated. In FLT mice, increased immunoreactivity for PECAM-1 (red) was predominantly present in GCL (Fig. 4A). PECAM-1 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the FLT group compared to GC mice (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, ZO-1 expression (red) was detected at the GCL and the photorecepotor inner segment (IS) of the eye tissues (Fig. 5A). The level of ZO-1 immunoactivity tended to be lower (p = 0.062) in the FLT group compared to that in GC controls (Fig. 5B). Figure 4.

PECAM-1 positive cells were identified with red fluorescence, endothelium was stained with lectin (green). The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells were found. In the retina from flight mice, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layers (GCL). Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 staining in the retina. The average fluorescence intensity for PECAM-1 activity was measured and calculated using the ImageJ program.

A MaxQuant database search (restricted to Mus musculus) identified a total of 6,634 proteins from all 12 samples with 6,353 (96%) proteins identified in common among the GC and FLT samples (Fig. 6). MaxQuant iBAQ intensity values were median normalized, log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution using Perseus (version 1.5.6.0)6. Batch effects were corrected using the ComBat function from the sva bioconductor package7. The log2 normalized iBAQ intensity values were used for statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the FDR level. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Venn diagram of the total number of proteins identified in the retinas of ground control and flight mice. 95.8% of the proteins were identified in both groups, while 2.7% and 1.6% of proteins identified were unique to ground control and flight, respectively.We identified a total of 6,634 proteins of which 485 significantly differentiated in FLT compared to GC by FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1). These proteins are shown as a heatmap using a hierarchical cluster of the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities for all samples (Fig. 7). The significant protein profile is able to clearly separate the two groups. This list was then reduced to 224 significant proteins when we included a fold change >2 cutoff (Supplementary Table 2). Volcano plots were generated to visualize all identified proteins and highlight significant proteins. The y-axis consists of −log10 p-values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted p-values, while the x-axis consists of the log2 fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a p-value of 0.05 (Fig. 8). A total of 126 proteins were up-regulated while 98 proteins were down-regulated in FLT compared to GC. Ten most significantly increased and decreased protein expression levels related to cellular organization, cell cycle, apoptosis, circadian clock, neuronal and mitochondrial function are summarized and listed in Table 1. These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis)8. Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). IPA revealed significant changes in pathways related to cell death, adhesion juction/tight junction signaling, calcium signaling, mitochondrial function and metabolism. Significantly affected canonical pathways between GC and FLT groups are shown in Fig. 9. Figure 7.

The data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in the retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors (Fig. 2), as well as evokes alterations in vascular levels of AQP-4 (Fig. 3), PECAM-1 (Fig. 4) and ZO-1 (Fig. 5), proteins related to BRB integrity. These changes in BRB characteristics suggest decrements in barrier function in the eye. Protein expression profiles and pathway analysis also provide evidence that spaceflight induces changes in cellular organization, cell cycle, mitochondrial function, circadian clock and oxidative stress in the retina. Collectively, these observations are consistent with and extend previous findings in rodents exposed to a weightless environment4,5 and suggest that spaceflight involves a complex combination of stressors that leads to alterations and impairment of ocular structure and function. Little is known about the impact of spaceflight on the BRB, but in disease states such as diabetes, where the BRB is compromised and microvascular permeability is elevated, visual impairment similar to the visual disturbances experienced by astronauts often occurs9,10. At least one recent study has shown that a compromise in the integrity of the vascular BRB causes vision-threatening vascular dysfunction11. Damage to microvascular endothelial cells is one of the major factors thought to underlie the increased permeability of the BRB in diabetic patients9,10. Radiation, another environmental stressor inherent to spaceflight, also induces disruption of endothelial barrier integrity12,13. In the present study, we found the spaceflight induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1. The water channel protein AQP-4 has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet membranes14. The upregulation of AQP-4 in flight retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential for barrier integrity disruption and edema formation. PECAM-1 is highly expressed at endothelial cell-cell junctions, where it functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to maintain endothelial cell junctional integrity15. It is important for leukocyte-endothelium interactions, including the migration of leukocytes across the endothelium during inflammation16. PECAM-1 has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular degeneration17. Increased expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells, including PECAM-1, has also been associated with BRB disruption after retinal vascular injury18. The higher PECAM-1 expression in retina following spaceflight may consequently facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to prolonged changes in the BRB permeability19. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on TJs, and possibly adherent junctions, among endothelial cells20. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-121. Indeed, the degradation of TJ-associated proteins in retinal vessels following injury has been shown to lead to retinal vascular disorganization and BRB breakdown14. We found a tendency for a lower expression of TJ-associated protein ZO-1, which is mostly expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells22. The greater apoptosis of retinal vascular endothelial cells coupled with alterations in retinal vascular AQP-4, PECAM-1 and ZO-1 levels in FLT mice collectively suggest that spaceflight increases the risk for BRB disruption, leading to possible ocular impairment and injury. After returning from long-duration spaceflight missions, many astronauts have been diagnosed with ocular structural and visual changes23. Studies have shown that changes in the gravitational environment can have pronounced transient and sustained effects on the eye24. Microgravity-induced vision changes may result from the interaction of multiple physiological factors, including changes in IOP, fluid shifts, ocular geometry and cardiovascular alterations25–27. Similarly, increases in IOP have been documented in ground-based models of spaceflight, such as head-down tilt28. As part of this study, we assessed IOP before and after spaceflight in fully conscious mice. Given the current evidence that BRB integrity is compromised by spaceflight (Figs 2–5), it was surprising to find a significant decrease in post-flight IOP in one eye of the FLT mice (Fig. 1) rather than an increase. There are several possible explanations for this apparent paradox. The first is whether the lower IOP in the left eye of FLT mice was biologically significant. The pre- and post-flight difference in the mean IOP of the left eye in the FLT mice was slightly less than 1 mmHg (Fig. 1). Likewise, the pre- and post-flight difference in the mean IOP of the left eye in the GC mice was also slightly less than 1 mmHg, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 1). This suggests that a ± 1 mmHg margin may be within the biological variability of the measure in mice. This, along with the lack of difference in the pre- and post-flight IOP of the right eye in the FLT mice, indicates that spaceflight had little to no significant biological effect on IOP measured approximately 1 day after returning to Earth. In this instance, it is also possible that BRB disruption and increases vascular permeability may contribute to the pathology of the visual disturbances, like those experienced by astronauts, without increases of IOP. Second, it is possible that spaceflight-induced increases in IOP are transient and no longer evident 28 hours after splash down. Confirmation of this possibility requires further measures of IOP during spaceflight. A third possible explanation for the apparent paradox of BRB disruption with no increase in IOP is that the magnitude of BRB alterations found with 35 days of spaceflight were not sufficient to elicit elevations in IOP. And finally, the disruption of BRB integrity coupled with the hemodynamic response to spaceflight in mice may have been insufficient to evoke an increase in IOP. For example, spaceflight in humans is thought to induce a cephalad fluid shift that can affect the flow and fluid pressures within the extracranial, intracranial and intraocular circulations, as well as within the cerebrospinal and aqueous humor fluid systems29. Similar cephalad fluid shifts have also been described in the hindlimb unloaded rat30–32, a ground-based rodent model to simulate a weightless environment. However, mice have a negligible hydrostatic pressure gradient on Earth owing to their small body size and do not show the same shifts in fluid volume during hindlimb unloading as that found in rats33. Additionally, during 30 days of spaceflight on the Bion-M1 satellite, mean arterial blood pressure in the aortic arch of mice is not altered34, and arteries in the head and hindlimbs of mice flown on the Bion-M1 and Space Shuttle do not show any structural remodeling to indicate chronic changes in fluid pressure associated with a cephalad fluid shift26,27,35. Thus, an impairment of BRB integrity in the eyes of mice during spaceflight may not result in an increase in IOP due to the lack of a cephalad fluid shift, as might be reasonably expected to occur in astronauts. This observation highlights one of the major limitations of utilizing mice to study the effects of spaceflight on bodily function instead of the rat. Proteomic analysis of the retina, optic disc and optic nerve also suggests that spaceflight has adverse effects on the eye. For example, proteomics analysis revealed that SCY 3-like protein (SCYL3), also known as the protein-associating with the C-terminal domain of Ezrin (PACE-1), was the most down-regulated protein in the flight mice compared to controls. SCYL3 is proposed to regulate membrane protein or lipid trafficking at the Golgi and plasma membrane36. More recent studies have shown that SCYL3 plays an important role in regulating neuronal function and survival in mice and humans37,38. Pleiotrophin (PTN), also known as heparin-binding brain mitogen (HBBM), is one of the most up-regulated proteins in our proteomic analysis. This protein is found predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), where it likely plays a role in tumor development including differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion, apoptosis and metastasis39. Many proteins that are associated with ophthalmic disease and injuries were significantly altered by spaceflight, including proteins in the crystallins family (CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYGA and CRYBA1). These proteins are important in contributing to retinal ganglion cell survival40. Reduced expression of these proteins may indicate increased risk for developing visual diseases. Figure 10 illustrates regulation and interaction of network of proteins responsible for ophthalmic disease and abnormalities as defined by IPA in response to spaceflight. Figure 10.

In this study, the expression of CRY1, also known as cryptochrome, an important clock protein, was significantly down regulated by spaceflight. A recent study showed that CRY encodes a critical circadian photoreceptor42. Findings indicate that CRY regulates the light-mediated entrainment and the daily rhythms of locomotion43,44. The overall results obtained in control mice showed there were no significant differences among GC, FV and GV control groups, suggesting that the time difference between tissue collection for the flight and ground cohorts did not have a significant impact on the measured endpoints. Therefore, we focused on comparisons between FLT and GC groups for most IHC assessments and the proteomics analysis, since these two groups shared the same flight hardware for housing and consumed the same food specially made for spaceflight. Additionally, the GC mice were exposed to the same environmental parameters as the FLT animals, including temperature, humidity and CO2 levels that were matched to the spaceflight condition. Because of logistical limitations of spaceflight experiment, mouse IOP was measured and euthanasia was performed 28–38 hours after splashdown. We understand this to be a limitation of the study for all measured parameters in evaluating spaceflight-induced changes. However, we speculate that the structural and proteomic changes observed would be minimally affected by the time delay because protein expression is relatively stable and often requires days to weeks to be altered in response to environmental changes. In contrast, fluid pressures such as IOP can change in a matter of seconds to minutes. In a previous investigation we reported the impact of 35 days of spaceflight on the mouse retina in animals which were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS5. Results from the current paper are in agree with this previous study that spaceflight induces significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells and some proteins and pathways associated with cell death, inflammation and metabolic stress were significantly altered following spaceflight Additionally, the current finding examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced changes and provide strong evidence that spaceflight impacts BRB integrity. However, the proteomics analysis showed limited overlap of significant differentiating proteins and pathways between these two flight studies. For example, in the prior study with JAXA mice there were alterations in the glycogen degradation, fatty acid β oxidation and DNA methylation and transcription pathways of the flight mice that were not identified in the current study. In contrast, changes in the actin cytoskeleton, tight junction, and epithelial adherens pathways were significantly altered with spaceflight in the present study that were not observed in the JAXA flight mice. Some contrasting proteomic results between the two flight studies may not be surprising since several experimental conditions were different. First, for the JAXA mouse study, the posterior half of the right eyecup containing the retinal layer, optic disc and a short segment of the optic nerve was used for proteomic analysis, whereas the eye sample evaluated in the current study only contained the retinal layer. And secondly, 9-week old C57BL/6 male mice were used for the JAXA flight study, and the flight animals and control animals were obtained from breeding colonies in the United States and Japan, respectively. It is possible, although unlikely, that some of the differences in the proteomic results between flight and control animals reflected differences in mice from the two different breeding colonies. The RR-9 mice were obtained from the same US breeding colony. Thus, we believe that differences in the effects of spaceflight on protein expression and pathways in the eyes of mice between the previous JAXA study5 and the current study primarily reflect differences in the composition of the eye samples tested. Such differences may be important in guiding our understanding of the regional effects of spaceflight in the eye. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that exposure to a spaceflight environment is associated with increased retinal endothelial cells and photoreceptor cell death. In addition, there were alterations in the retinal microvasculature BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell organization, circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered. Multiple factors could be responsible for the changes observed in the FLT mice, including 35 days of weightlessness, increased radiation exposure, and distress associated with live return through the Earth’s atmosphere, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, transport to the LLU laboratory, and approximately 38 hours of re-exposure to Earth’s gravity. The data further indicate that astronauts may be at risk for retinal damage and late degeneration. Such findings may also help facilitate the development and testing of more effective countermeasures for human spaceflight and planetary exploration.Material and Methods Flight and control conditions On August 14, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) which included 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were kept equivalent to that of FLT mice based on 48 h delayed telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same reformulated rodent food bar diet approved by NASA as the space flown mice. Consumption of food and water was monitored daily throughout this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and activities involving vertebrate animals are carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (). Due to Hurricane Irma’s impact on KSC in September, 2017, experiments with both GC and GV control groups were cancelled and later rescheduled for May, 2018, using mice of the same strain, sex, age and animals were from the same holding room from the vendor that were used for the flight experiments. This resulted in a large time gap between tissue collection for the flight and KSC ground control groups. Consequently, the FV cohort-matched control group was added to the study to help control for possible differences associated with this delay. Tissue collection with the FV group were conducted several days after studies with the FLT animals were concluded. Table 2 details the groups, housing conditions and mouse bodyweights for this study.

At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. The inspecting personnel reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized.IOP measurement Before launch and again before the post-flight euthanization, a handheld tonometer (TonoLab-ICARE, Raleigh, NC) was used to measure IOP in conscious animals. This allowed IOP to be measured accurately, rapidly and without a local anesthetic. Measurements of IOP using the rebound tonometer appeared to be well tolerated by the mice. The animals exhibited no signs of irritation or discomfort during the procedure. Five-6 sequential measurements were made to obtain an average of the counts as a single IOP readout for each mouse45. This process was repeated three times for each eye.Eye and retina preparation after spaceflight The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown (n = 20/group). The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: GC and FLT were dissected to obtain the retina, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for proteomics analysis.TUNEL assay The ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. Briefly, six μm paraffin embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (Catalog No. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). Six to 10 field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina per section.Immunohistochemistry for AQP-4 and vascular double-labeling Six μm sections were incubated overnight (18–21 hours) at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP-4 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX) and monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clone GA5 (1:1000, Millipore, Burlington, MA) in 0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS and further treated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.Immunostaining assays for PECAM-1 and ZO-1 Immunofluorescence staining related to BRB integrity on ocular sections was performed using biomarkers against PECAM-1 and ZO-1. Six µm sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated and washed in PBS for 20 minutes. For enzymatic antigen retrieval, sections were incubated in 1 mg/ml Actinase E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 20 minutes at 37 °C, rinsed in running tap water for 3 minutes and washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Sections were then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 10 minutes wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (1:50) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) or CD31/PECAM-1 (1:100) (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO) in antibody dilution buffer (0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 hours with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS; Life Technologies) washed in PBS and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.Quantification of Immunostaining For quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells and TUNEL positive endothelial cells were counted separately. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear /ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina were counted in 5 sections from each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.4 software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. To determine AQP4, ZO-1 and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 6 to 10 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group.Proteomics analysis A total of 12 frozen retinas from 2 experimental groups (GC and FLT, n = 6 mice per group) were shipped to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for proteomics analysis. Protein lysates were prepared and 20 μg of protein lysate were resolved in a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The gel was cut into 12 thick gel slices (2 mm thick) for each sample and an in-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described in (Mao et al. 2018). Briefly, gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 100 mM. Once destained, the proteins were reduced in 10 mM Tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX) and alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were prepared for trypsin digestion by dehydrating in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An overnight trypsin digestion was performed by the addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce Corp.) to stop the trypsin reaction. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a 200 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 minute gradient from 97:3 to 65:35 buffer A: B ratio. [Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] The peptide eluents were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV), MS1 peptides were detected and subjected to MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Corp.) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0.Bioinformatic analysis of proteomics data Proteins were identified and quantified using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16, Max Planck Institute). MS/MS spectra were submitted to MaxQuant for database searching using the UniProtKB database (2018-06 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries). MS1 iBAQ protein intensities were obtained by performing a MS1 reporter type database search with trypsin digestion including up to three missed cleavages. Modifications included both fixed modifications (carbamidomethyl of cysteine) and variable modifications (oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus). The first search was set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance for a search against a contaminants database in order to identify commonly identified contaminants, such as keratin proteins. The main search against the mouse database was set to 3 ppm. Label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1 was selected to obtain the MS1 intensity values. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold46. The MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were median normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median (sample FLT 5). Median normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Principal Component Analysis was performed on the normalized data set and a batch effect was detected among replicates due to sample processing (data not shown). The batch effect was corrected using the R function ComBat from the SVA Bioconductor package7. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney u tests were used to compare the ground GC and FLT sample groups. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Bioconductor R package ComplexHeatmap with the Euclidean distance metric and the clustering method set to complete47. Volcano plots were generated using R base function plot (R version 3.4.4). These significant proteins were then analyzed using IPA (QIAGEN Inc., Frederick, MD).Statistical analysis The results obtained from IOP measurements, TUNEL assay and IHC were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. The statistical analysis of proteomics results is described above.Supplementary information Supplemental Table 1 (2.5MB, xlsx) Supplementary Table 2 (94.4KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements This study was supported by NASA Space Biology grant # NNX15AB41G, National Institutes of Health grant P20GM121293, UL1TR000039, P20GM103625, S10OD018445 and P20GM103429, NNX15AB50G, and LLU Department of Basic Sciences.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, chronic low-dose irradiation, brain, transcriptome",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation [1] and fluid shifts [2] experienced during short- and long-term spaceflight. An important goal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to identify the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on the CNS to better prepare astronauts during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. During missions beyond low-earth orbit (LEO), astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). While high linear energy transfer (LET) galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and low LET solar particle event (SPE) radiation contribute large portions of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3], interactions between GCR and SPE particles and spacecraft release secondary radiation including γ-rays that can deliver a significant fraction of the total mission does [4]. In addition, altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight) affects homeostatic fluid-shifting in the CNS. Studies examining readaptation to Earth’s gravity are of equal importance, as recovery from spaceflight exposure may require medical intervention, in particular within organs known to be sensitive to irradiation and fluid shifts. Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleep–wake cycles) [5]. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) [6]. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre- and post-flight (shuttle missions <30 days and ISS mission <200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans [7]. Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight [8]. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior [9,10,11]. The effects of acute radiation doses on the CNS have been well documented [12]. However, responses to chronic LDR exposure, as encountered on space missions (<0.04 Gy/y), are not well investigated [13], particularly in a pan-transcriptome context. Moreover, long-term readaptive outcomes on neurohealth following spaceflight-like conditions are less studied. Due to the need to better understand the transcriptional changes associated with chronic LDR in combination with reduced gravity (unloading) on neurohealth, mice were exposed to chronic LDR γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy), HLU, or a combination of HLU+LDR for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), while data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) were analyzed to determine differentially methylated promoters (DMP) [14]. Overall, we found minimal gene alterations at 4 months of readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR, namely, in pathways related to the reduced expression of translational machinery, while the combination of HLU+LDR resulted in a wide panel of altered DEG and DMP profiles for tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis markers and neuropeptides. Therefore, exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair that is cooperatively engaged post-HLU+LDR exposure to maintain neural homeostasis.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animals Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory), as previously reported [10], were utilized in this report. Upon arrival, they were acclimatized for 7 days in standard habitats at 20 °C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Commercial pellet chow and hydrogel were available ad libitum. Animal health status, water and food intake were monitored daily. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [36] and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). 4.2. Experimental Conditions Following acclimatization, animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (n = 3); (2) hindlimb unloaded (HLU) (n = 6); (3) low-dose irradiated (LDR) (n = 6); and (4) combination hindlimb unloaded and low-dose irradiated (HLU+LDR) (n = 4) for 21 days. Post-experimental exposure animals were group housed (3 per cage) for up to 4 months (4M). 4.3. Hindlimb Unloading and Whole-Body Irradiation Hindlimb-unloaded animals (HLU) were treated as previously described [37], with animals maintained at a 35–40 head-down tilt with the hindlimbs elevated above the bottom of the cage. LDR gamma irradiation was performed by placing 57Co plates (185 MBq activity; GPI, Stoughton, WI) under the cages (1 plate per 2 cages). These cobalt plates deliver chronic low-dose/low-dose-rate γ-ray irradiation. A total dose of 0.04 Gy was delivered at a rate of 0.01 cGy/h over 21 days. HLU+LDR animals were both unloaded and irradiated as described here. Control animals received no treatment. All animals were handled similarly. 4.4. Euthanasia, Dissection, Tissue Storage, and Nucleic Acid Extraction Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2 followed by immediate exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately after euthanasia brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres, with the brainstem and cerebellum removed. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue homogenization was performed using the Tissue homogenizing CKMix (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) on a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). RNA and DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C. 4.5. RNA Sequencing The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–96 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used per manufacturer’s instructions to construct RNA-Seq libraries. A total of 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA spiked with 1 µL of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Barcodes with unique indices out of 96 indices, were used per sample for multiplexing. Strand selection was performed using a custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice (NuGEN Technologies). Libraries were amplified by PCR with 17 cycles on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA). These libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Mira Loma, CA, USA) to generate 15–30 M 75-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14]. 4.6. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) The RRBS library was constructed with 100 ng of gDNA as input using Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation followed by ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. The ligation products were finally repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C for 10 min, 70 °C for 10 min, held at 4 °C). The product of the final repair reaction was used for bisulfite conversion using the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). The RRBS libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 at Loma Linda Center for Genomics to generate 15–55 M 70-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14]. 4.7. Differential Expression and Pathway Enrichment Analysis Sequencing reads were first trimmed with Cutadapt [38] using the Trim Galore! wrapper. Reads were mapped with STAR [39], expression quantified with RSEM [40] and tximport [41] was used to import counts into DESeq2 [42] for the detection of differentially expressed genes. Log2 fold-change and adjusted p-value cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 were used, respectively. Enriched GO terms were detected with WebGestalt [43] using the biological process database. Enriched pathways were detected with Reactome version 67 [44] using an overrepresentation analysis and the full list of DEGs. Human pathways were found using Reactome’s “Project to human” option. Heatmaps were generated using the webtool Morpheus, from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) by performing hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance. The volcano plots in Figure 2 were generated with the R package EnhancedVolcano. The UpSet diagram in Figure 4 was generated using Intervene [16]. 4.8. Differential Methylation Analysis Sequencing reads were first trimmed with Cutadapt [38] using the Trim Galore! wrapper using the “--RRBS” flag before processing with the “bismark” and “bismark_methylation_extractor” scripts from Bismark [45]. The differential methylation of gene bodies and promoters was performed with RnBeads version 1.10.8 and R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation, Boston, MA, USA) [46]. The combined ranking score was utilized to detect differential methylation. It combines absolute and relative effect sizes as well as p-values from statistical modeling into a single score.",

Experimental Design and Mouse Body Weights Across Experimental and Readaptation Timepoints To assess the effects of prolonged spaceflight-like conditions on central nervous system (CNS) health following exposure, 6-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were either irradiated with low-dose γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy, LDR), hindlimb unloaded (HLU) or a combination of the two (HLU+LDR) for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period (Figure 1A). While the LDR γ-ray irradiation used does not recapitulate the entire space radiation spectrum, it constitutes a significant fraction and poses a hazard to astronauts’ health [15]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental timeline and body weights during- and post-hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose irradiation (LDR) or combined HLU+LDR. (A) Whole brains were isolated from C57BL/6J at 4 months post-experimental conditions of hindlimb unloading (HLU, 21 days), low-dose irradiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy for 21 days) or combined LDR and HLU timeline. (B) Body weights were monitored throughout the experiment (21 days) and during readaptation (4 months post-experimental exposure). Baseline weights were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure. An unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction compared experimental groups with controls. A * denotes significance of HLU only compared to controls at the 7-day timepoint. Error bars denote standard error of means. Dashed gray arrows highlight start and endpoints of experimental LDR and HLU treatments, and the final timepoint of the experiment when tissue was collected for transcriptomic analysis.Total body weights were monitored from the initiation of the experimental conditions (0 days), throughout the duration of exposure (up to 21 days), and during the readaptation period (4 months, 4M). Mice were weighted weekly at the same time as the 21-day exposure and monthly for the 4-month readaptation phase. Baseline weight measurements were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure. While there was no difference with LDR alone compared to control animals, a trend for decreased body weight in HLU and HLU+LDR combination conditions versus controls was noted, while statistical significance was observed at 7 days post-experimental start in HLU only (Figure 1B). Furthermore, during the readaptation period, decreased weights observed in HLU and in HLU+LDR animals recovered to control values, indicating physiological readaptation following exposure to spaceflight-like conditions. Modeled microgravity in combination with chronic low-dose irradiation results in increased differential gene expression in brains at 4 months post-exposure. To determine the readaptation effects on the CNS at 4 months post-exposure, whole brains were isolated and mid-sagittal sectioned into two hemispheres. The right hemisphere was further sectioned mid-coronal and the caudal cortex (including hind- and midbrain) regions were collected for RNA-seq analysis. Collected brains were free of cerebellum and brainstem contamination. Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data revealed clustering of samples by experimental conditions (Figure 2A), while volcano plots showed limited DEG (p < 0.05, Log2 fold change > 0.263) in all but the combination HLU+LDR (Figure 2B). Figure 2. Open in a new tab HLU in combination with LDR results in a heightened differentially expressed gene (DEG) profile in brains isolated at 4 months post-experimental conditions. DEG identified in brain isolated at 4 months post-LDR (0.04 Gy for 21 days), HLU (21 days) or combined HLU+LDR. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) displays sample clustering within each experimental condition (n = 3–6). (B) Volcano plots indicate DEG profiles at 4 months post-experimental conditions. Vertical dashed lines indicate the Log2 fold-change cutoff used (0.263), while horizontal dashed lines indicate the adjusted p-value cutoff used (0.05). Red dots indicate differentially expressed genes that meet our adjusted p-value and Log2 fold-change cutoffs and compose our set of differentially expressed genes. Green dots indicate genes that do not meet our adjusted p-value cutoff and, therefore, are not differentially expressed. Darker saturation of color represents overlap of genes.Brain readaptation following exposure to LDR alone displayed minimal (5) DEG with large fold change inductions only in genes of unknown function (Figure 3A, Table 1). Brain readaptation following exposure to HLU alone displayed 11 DEG with known functions primarily associated with reduced protein synthesis and/or functions mediated by ribosomes (Figure 3B, Table 1). In contrast to single exposures, brain readaptation following exposure to a combination of HLU+LDR displayed numerous (270) DEG associated with various cellular functions including tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis and neuropeptide production (Figure 3C, Table 1). Comprehensive DEG lists are provided in the supplemental data (Table S1). Collectively, these results showed minimal transcriptional changes in single treatment groups at 4 months post-exposure, while the combined exposure to HLU+LDR resulted in multiple DEG. Figure 3.

LDR, HLU and Combined HLU+LDR Exposures Displayed Minimal Gene and Promoter Methylation Overlap at 4 Months Readaptation Given that there were significant changes in gene expression in the combined exposure to HLU+LDR mice at the 4-month timepoint, we next determined whether these changes in gene expression reflected modifications to cytosine methylation using RRBS analysis. RRBS revealed 137, 71 and 170 differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) in the LDR, HLU, and HLU+LDR animals, respectively (Table 1). A full list of DMPs is provided in supplementary data (Table S2). To find overlap across assays and experimental conditions, gene sets were created from DEG (upregulated/downregulated) and genes corresponding to DMPs (hypermethylated/hypomethylated). Overlapping genes between these sets were determined (Table 2) and summarized in an UpSet diagram [16] (Figure 4). Overall, there was little overlap between assays and experimental conditions (grey bars/dots/line). Most overlap was observed between DMPs from different experimental conditions (red bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs from different experimental conditions was minimal (blue bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs and DMPs from the same experimental condition or from different experimental conditions were also minimal (black bars/dots/lines). Collectively, these results indicated most DEGs and DMPs are unique to their experimental condition with minimal overlap between exposure groups. Table 2.

Readaptation at 4 Months Following Exposure to Combined HLU+LDR Involves Gene Expression Changes in Multiple Brain-Associated Pathways To determine the associated mechanisms involved in readaptation and neuroplasticity from simulated spaceflight combined HLU+LDR exposure, we used WebGestalt to detect enriched gene ontology (GO) terms in sets of up- and downregulated genes in post-HLU+LDR animals (Figure 5A,B, Table S3). The downregulated set was enriched for GO terms associated with neurogenesis, transmembrane transport, cell signaling, and neurosynaptic and brain architecture deficits (Figure 5A). The upregulated DEG set was enriched for terms associated with cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and hormonal regulation (Figure 5B). Mouse Reactome pathway analyses of DEGs in the post-HLU+LDR animals indicated biological processes associated with signal transduction, neurodevelopment and neurohomeostasis (Figure S1A, Table S4). Human Reactome pathway translational analyses identified human orthologs involved in neurotransmission and cellular signaling (Figure S1B and Table 3). Collectively, brain-readaptation post-combination HLU+LDR resulted in altered expression in pathways governing biological processes associated with neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neurostructural reorganization and neuropeptide production.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion Herein, we identified that chronic exposure (21 days) to single or combined HLU and LDR resulted in long-term transcriptional alterations in CNS brain tissue in female mice at 4 months post-exposure. The gene expression changes observed here imply reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and cell signaling. These studies offer translational value into pathways regulated in humans, as gene ontology analyses identified similar genetic overlap between mice and human profiles, in particular in pathways involved in neurodevelopmental homeostasis and signal transduction. Collectively, brain-related transcriptional changes that are dynamic in readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to long-term neurological consequences. Indeed, 21 days of exposure to combined HLU+LDR did not result in immediate neurobehavioral deficits (1 week post-exposure); however, increased risk-taking behavior was observed at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating delayed neurological impairments in a combination of HLU+LDR, that was not apparent in HLU or LDR only. To assess CNS effects, 4-month post-experimental conditions mid/hindbrain (sans cerebellum and brainstem) were collected, sectioned, and total RNA was isolated for RNA-seq analysis. This portion of the brain houses the hippocampus, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and thalamus, and is a major signaling hub for the neuroendocrine system (hypothalamus and pituitary gland). Mid/hindbrain sections were assessed to localize the transcriptional profile to a region that is central to neurogenesis (hippocampus) and hypothalamic–pituitary axis (HPA) responses, in order to better assess neurofunctional output without potential contamination from the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The results displayed robust DEG alterations within combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation compared to controls, and marginal DEG alterations in single HLU or LDR at 4 months readaptation. At 4 months post-HLU exposure, DEGs including EphrB3 and Sh2d5 were altered, suggesting cell morphological and structural changes are active at this timepoint. At 4 months post-LDR exposure, only five DEGs were found, four of which have an unknown function. One DEG, Rps13, was reduced, suggesting impaired protein synthesis and/or other functional outputs mediated by ribosomes. Interestingly, Rps13 was also reduced in HLU alone at 4 months readaptation along with other protein synthesis-related genes, including Hist1h2bc and Rpl36a-ps2, collectively suggesting fundamental translational pathways are altered during chronic HLU and LDR during readaptation. In line with this, another group has reported that chronic LDR whole brain irradiation resulted in protein synthesis impairment [1] that can affect adult neurogenesis [17]. Interestingly, no notable protein synthesis pathway deficits were identified in combined HLU+LDR exposures, suggesting distinct responses are generated within each experimental condition at readaptation. Moreover, very limited DEG overlap was observed between experimental conditions, further validating unique responses to each condition and highlighting the importance of implementing combined exposure studies to better assess spaceflight-like readaptation effects on the nervous system. Other spaceflight-like factors such as hypoxia and social isolation were not assessed in this study and merit further investigation. Nonetheless, the usefulness of this model provides a scaffold for future studies to assess the long-term effects of combination HLU+LDR on the health of the nervous system. Brain structural damage through disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is associated with neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral dysfunctions [18]. Our previous study showed that aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-channel protein involved in brain water homeostasis, was up-regulated following combined exposure to irradiation and unloading [9], suggesting a disturbance in BBB integrity may lead to edema [19]. Furthermore, AQP4 induction was seen in concert with subtle behavioral changes at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating a potential role for BBB dysfunction and neurobehavioral consequences. Although Aqp4 was not identified in this study, Aqp1 gene expression was induced following combination of HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting similar BBB disturbances and possible shifts in brain water homeostasis [19]. In line with this, the induction of aquaporins may be linked to neuroinflammation [20,21,22], while the upregulation of additional immune activation markers including Cd74, H2-Ab1, C1ql2 and Ifit-3 were also identified in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, along with hypomethylated Cfi and Mx1, collectively suggesting chronic neuroinflammation may persist during brain readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposure. In response to extracellular cues (i.e., edema), cells rearrange their structures and ion transport proteins to maintain equilibrium [22,23,24]. Furthermore, neuroplasticity is a homeostatic repair mechanism that involves the formation of new synapses and neural processes to compensate for their communication loss following brain infarct, injury or disease [12]. These new formations result in brain restructuring and function, which may be occurring during readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposures. Indeed, our results fall in line with responses that were observed within brains isolated hours post-LDR (10 cGy) exposure, whereby multiple synaptic ion transport genes were altered [25]. Herein, multiple cell structural genes, i.e., Drc7, Dnah7b and Fmnl1 and ion transport genes, i.e., Gria3, Grin2a, Calb2, Scn5a, Clcn5, Kcnj13, Kcnn1 and Kcnh1, were altered post-combination HLU+LDR conditions. Moreover, hypomethylation analyses indicated altered cytoskeletal organization, i.e., Ndel1, Cald1 and Lmod3 were observed in both LDR and HLU, suggesting cellular structural changes involved in neuroplasticity and readaptation processes are active, in order to restructure and/or maintain brain homeostasis. Tight junctions, including claudins, connexins, and occludins contribute to BBB permeability and maintenance. A reduction in these molecules has been implicated in acute BBB disruption in neuroviral [26] and neuroinflammatory diseases [27]. In line with this, Cdh12 was downregulated, whereas, Cldn2 was induced in combination of HLU+LDR. Furthermore, Cdhr4 was hypomethylated in both LDR alone and HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, while Cdhr2 was hypomethylated in LDR and HLU alone, but not in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting BBB restructuring, and further indicating the dynamic process of brain physiology during readaptation. Adult neurogenesis is a process of neural and glia self-renewal and the generation of progenitor cells from radial glial cells (RGCs) within the subventricular and subgranular zones of the hippocampus [28]. RGCs are quiescent and are activated to initiate neurogenesis in response to a stimulus [29], such as LDR [17,30] or models of increased intracranial pressure [31,32]. Indeed, the majority of highly upregulated DEGs post-combination HLU+LDR were involved in HPA signaling, neuropeptide growth factors, and neurogenesis, i.e., Otp, Uncx, Ucn3, Avp, Pmch, Prox1, Calb2, Tbr-1, and Hcrt. While the magnitude of gene expression does not always result in observable phenotypes, these notable DEGs may serve an important purpose in neuromaintenance during readaptation. Interestingly, Crh, a stress-induced hormone, was hypermethylated post-exposure to LDR and combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, implying transcriptional silencing of Crh may be engaged to suppress robust HPA activity during readaptation, which warrants further studies. Readaptation results from combined exposures to HLU+LDR are in agreement with literature that spaceflight can alter neurofunction. Indeed, neurocognitive and behavioral effects via altered decision making, problem solving, visual perceptions, motor controls, and sleep–wake cycles have all been identified in flight [5]. While “space-brain” characteristics have suggested astronauts are at risk of developing neurological sequelae in flight [33] and post-flight [6,7]. Due to the limitations of human neurological studies, mouse models provide an excellent alternative, with the caveat that fluid shifts in mice are marginal in comparison to their human counterparts. Therefore, follow-up studies utilizing larger mammals, i.e., rats, may provide more robust responses. Further, readaptation effects from radiation have been described to cause differential nervous system responses in sex, age, type of irradiation, duration of exposure and total doses [1,12,34], while the readaptation effects of prolonged HLU on the neurohealth of different sexes and age groups are still unclear. Therefore, future studies approaching these additional demographics, both modeled in mice or rats, are required. Nonetheless, our readaptation study in mice exposed to combined HLU+LDR displayed a panel of neurological changes that were translational to humans, suggesting this is a suitable animal model to study spaceflight-related readaptation effects on the nervous system. Additionally, future studies should expand the types of radiation exposure animals experience in order to fully capture the spectrum of radiation that bombards astronauts during spaceflight. The space radiation environment beyond LEO contains several types of ionizing radiation. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) with relatively high linear energy transfer (LET) and proton radiation due to solar particle events (SPEs) contribute a significant portion of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3]. High-energy heavy ions (HZE radiation) can produce distinct patterns of energy deposition in cells and tissues [13,35]. However, secondary particles produced by the interaction of SPE protons and heavy-charged GCR particles with the spacecraft structure include γ-rays and x-rays [3]. These radiation sources can also deliver a significant fraction of the total mission dose and pose a hazard to astronauts’ health [15]. For chronic irradiation exposure, we used flood sources consisting of plastic sheets embedded with the isotope 57Co that emits medium energy (122 and 136 keV) γ-rays. Additional research is needed to elucidate the CNS damage and readaptation response induced by the full spectrum of space radiation. In summary, a multitude of neurological effects and persistent brain transcriptional alterations were observed at 4 months post-HLU+LDR in 21-day exposures. Changes included reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and signaling genes. Thus, brain-related transcriptional changes are dynamic and plastic during readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions, and while these exposures may lead to long-term neurological consequences, the active processes of neuroplasticity and repair are engaged to maintain neural homeostasis.",

Copyright notice ID: 6747492 PMID: 31443374 Abstract Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, chronic low-dose irradiation, brain, transcriptome1. Introduction The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation [1] and fluid shifts [2] experienced during short- and long-term spaceflight. An important goal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to identify the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on the CNS to better prepare astronauts during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. During missions beyond low-earth orbit (LEO), astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). While high linear energy transfer (LET) galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and low LET solar particle event (SPE) radiation contribute large portions of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3], interactions between GCR and SPE particles and spacecraft release secondary radiation including γ-rays that can deliver a significant fraction of the total mission does [4]. In addition, altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight) affects homeostatic fluid-shifting in the CNS. Studies examining readaptation to Earth’s gravity are of equal importance, as recovery from spaceflight exposure may require medical intervention, in particular within organs known to be sensitive to irradiation and fluid shifts. Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleep–wake cycles) [5]. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) [6]. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre- and post-flight (shuttle missions <30 days and ISS mission <200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans [7]. Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight [8]. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior [9,10,11]. The effects of acute radiation doses on the CNS have been well documented [12]. However, responses to chronic LDR exposure, as encountered on space missions (<0.04 Gy/y), are not well investigated [13], particularly in a pan-transcriptome context. Moreover, long-term readaptive outcomes on neurohealth following spaceflight-like conditions are less studied. Due to the need to better understand the transcriptional changes associated with chronic LDR in combination with reduced gravity (unloading) on neurohealth, mice were exposed to chronic LDR γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy), HLU, or a combination of HLU+LDR for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), while data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) were analyzed to determine differentially methylated promoters (DMP) [14]. Overall, we found minimal gene alterations at 4 months of readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR, namely, in pathways related to the reduced expression of translational machinery, while the combination of HLU+LDR resulted in a wide panel of altered DEG and DMP profiles for tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis markers and neuropeptides. Therefore, exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair that is cooperatively engaged post-HLU+LDR exposure to maintain neural homeostasis.2. Results 2.1. Experimental Design and Mouse Body Weights Across Experimental and Readaptation Timepoints To assess the effects of prolonged spaceflight-like conditions on central nervous system (CNS) health following exposure, 6-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were either irradiated with low-dose γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy, LDR), hindlimb unloaded (HLU) or a combination of the two (HLU+LDR) for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period (Figure 1A). While the LDR γ-ray irradiation used does not recapitulate the entire space radiation spectrum, it constitutes a significant fraction and poses a hazard to astronauts’ health [15]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental timeline and body weights during- and post-hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose irradiation (LDR) or combined HLU+LDR. (A) Whole brains were isolated from C57BL/6J at 4 months post-experimental conditions of hindlimb unloading (HLU, 21 days), low-dose irradiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy for 21 days) or combined LDR and HLU timeline. (B) Body weights were monitored throughout the experiment (21 days) and during readaptation (4 months post-experimental exposure). Baseline weights were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure. An unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction compared experimental groups with controls. A * denotes significance of HLU only compared to controls at the 7-day timepoint. Error bars denote standard error of means. Dashed gray arrows highlight start and endpoints of experimental LDR and HLU treatments, and the final timepoint of the experiment when tissue was collected for transcriptomic analysis.Total body weights were monitored from the initiation of the experimental conditions (0 days), throughout the duration of exposure (up to 21 days), and during the readaptation period (4 months, 4M). Mice were weighted weekly at the same time as the 21-day exposure and monthly for the 4-month readaptation phase. Baseline weight measurements were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure. While there was no difference with LDR alone compared to control animals, a trend for decreased body weight in HLU and HLU+LDR combination conditions versus controls was noted, while statistical significance was observed at 7 days post-experimental start in HLU only (Figure 1B). Furthermore, during the readaptation period, decreased weights observed in HLU and in HLU+LDR animals recovered to control values, indicating physiological readaptation following exposure to spaceflight-like conditions. Modeled microgravity in combination with chronic low-dose irradiation results in increased differential gene expression in brains at 4 months post-exposure. To determine the readaptation effects on the CNS at 4 months post-exposure, whole brains were isolated and mid-sagittal sectioned into two hemispheres. The right hemisphere was further sectioned mid-coronal and the caudal cortex (including hind- and midbrain) regions were collected for RNA-seq analysis. Collected brains were free of cerebellum and brainstem contamination. Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq data revealed clustering of samples by experimental conditions (Figure 2A), while volcano plots showed limited DEG (p < 0.05, Log2 fold change > 0.263) in all but the combination HLU+LDR (Figure 2B).

Vertical dashed lines indicate the Log2 fold-change cutoff used (0.263), while horizontal dashed lines indicate the adjusted p-value cutoff used (0.05). Red dots indicate differentially expressed genes that meet our adjusted p-value and Log2 fold-change cutoffs and compose our set of differentially expressed genes. Green dots indicate genes that do not meet our adjusted p-value cutoff and, therefore, are not differentially expressed. Darker saturation of color represents overlap of genes.Brain readaptation following exposure to LDR alone displayed minimal (5) DEG with large fold change inductions only in genes of unknown function (Figure 3A, Table 1). Brain readaptation following exposure to HLU alone displayed 11 DEG with known functions primarily associated with reduced protein synthesis and/or functions mediated by ribosomes (Figure 3B, Table 1). In contrast to single exposures, brain readaptation following exposure to a combination of HLU+LDR displayed numerous (270) DEG associated with various cellular functions including tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis and neuropeptide production (Figure 3C, Table 1). Comprehensive DEG lists are provided in the supplemental data (Table S1). Collectively, these results showed minimal transcriptional changes in single treatment groups at 4 months post-exposure, while the combined exposure to HLU+LDR resulted in multiple DEG. Figure 3.

LDR, HLU and Combined HLU+LDR Exposures Displayed Minimal Gene and Promoter Methylation Overlap at 4 Months Readaptation Given that there were significant changes in gene expression in the combined exposure to HLU+LDR mice at the 4-month timepoint, we next determined whether these changes in gene expression reflected modifications to cytosine methylation using RRBS analysis. RRBS revealed 137, 71 and 170 differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) in the LDR, HLU, and HLU+LDR animals, respectively (Table 1). A full list of DMPs is provided in supplementary data (Table S2). To find overlap across assays and experimental conditions, gene sets were created from DEG (upregulated/downregulated) and genes corresponding to DMPs (hypermethylated/hypomethylated). Overlapping genes between these sets were determined (Table 2) and summarized in an UpSet diagram [16] (Figure 4). Overall, there was little overlap between assays and experimental conditions (grey bars/dots/line). Most overlap was observed between DMPs from different experimental conditions (red bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs from different experimental conditions was minimal (blue bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs and DMPs from the same experimental condition or from different experimental conditions were also minimal (black bars/dots/lines). Collectively, these results indicated most DEGs and DMPs are unique to their experimental condition with minimal overlap between exposure groups. Table 2.

Readaptation at 4 Months Following Exposure to Combined HLU+LDR Involves Gene Expression Changes in Multiple Brain-Associated Pathways To determine the associated mechanisms involved in readaptation and neuroplasticity from simulated spaceflight combined HLU+LDR exposure, we used WebGestalt to detect enriched gene ontology (GO) terms in sets of up- and downregulated genes in post-HLU+LDR animals (Figure 5A,B, Table S3). The downregulated set was enriched for GO terms associated with neurogenesis, transmembrane transport, cell signaling, and neurosynaptic and brain architecture deficits (Figure 5A). The upregulated DEG set was enriched for terms associated with cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and hormonal regulation (Figure 5B). Mouse Reactome pathway analyses of DEGs in the post-HLU+LDR animals indicated biological processes associated with signal transduction, neurodevelopment and neurohomeostasis (Figure S1A, Table S4). Human Reactome pathway translational analyses identified human orthologs involved in neurotransmission and cellular signaling (Figure S1B and Table 3). Collectively, brain-readaptation post-combination HLU+LDR resulted in altered expression in pathways governing biological processes associated with neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neurostructural reorganization and neuropeptide production. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Altered biological processes and pathways identified at 4 months post-combined HLU+LDR exposure.

Discussion Herein, we identified that chronic exposure (21 days) to single or combined HLU and LDR resulted in long-term transcriptional alterations in CNS brain tissue in female mice at 4 months post-exposure. The gene expression changes observed here imply reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and cell signaling. These studies offer translational value into pathways regulated in humans, as gene ontology analyses identified similar genetic overlap between mice and human profiles, in particular in pathways involved in neurodevelopmental homeostasis and signal transduction. Collectively, brain-related transcriptional changes that are dynamic in readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to long-term neurological consequences. Indeed, 21 days of exposure to combined HLU+LDR did not result in immediate neurobehavioral deficits (1 week post-exposure); however, increased risk-taking behavior was observed at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating delayed neurological impairments in a combination of HLU+LDR, that was not apparent in HLU or LDR only. To assess CNS effects, 4-month post-experimental conditions mid/hindbrain (sans cerebellum and brainstem) were collected, sectioned, and total RNA was isolated for RNA-seq analysis. This portion of the brain houses the hippocampus, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and thalamus, and is a major signaling hub for the neuroendocrine system (hypothalamus and pituitary gland). Mid/hindbrain sections were assessed to localize the transcriptional profile to a region that is central to neurogenesis (hippocampus) and hypothalamic–pituitary axis (HPA) responses, in order to better assess neurofunctional output without potential contamination from the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The results displayed robust DEG alterations within combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation compared to controls, and marginal DEG alterations in single HLU or LDR at 4 months readaptation. At 4 months post-HLU exposure, DEGs including EphrB3 and Sh2d5 were altered, suggesting cell morphological and structural changes are active at this timepoint. At 4 months post-LDR exposure, only five DEGs were found, four of which have an unknown function. One DEG, Rps13, was reduced, suggesting impaired protein synthesis and/or other functional outputs mediated by ribosomes. Interestingly, Rps13 was also reduced in HLU alone at 4 months readaptation along with other protein synthesis-related genes, including Hist1h2bc and Rpl36a-ps2, collectively suggesting fundamental translational pathways are altered during chronic HLU and LDR during readaptation. In line with this, another group has reported that chronic LDR whole brain irradiation resulted in protein synthesis impairment [1] that can affect adult neurogenesis [17]. Interestingly, no notable protein synthesis pathway deficits were identified in combined HLU+LDR exposures, suggesting distinct responses are generated within each experimental condition at readaptation. Moreover, very limited DEG overlap was observed between experimental conditions, further validating unique responses to each condition and highlighting the importance of implementing combined exposure studies to better assess spaceflight-like readaptation effects on the nervous system. Other spaceflight-like factors such as hypoxia and social isolation were not assessed in this study and merit further investigation. Nonetheless, the usefulness of this model provides a scaffold for future studies to assess the long-term effects of combination HLU+LDR on the health of the nervous system. Brain structural damage through disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is associated with neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral dysfunctions [18]. Our previous study showed that aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-channel protein involved in brain water homeostasis, was up-regulated following combined exposure to irradiation and unloading [9], suggesting a disturbance in BBB integrity may lead to edema [19]. Furthermore, AQP4 induction was seen in concert with subtle behavioral changes at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating a potential role for BBB dysfunction and neurobehavioral consequences. Although Aqp4 was not identified in this study, Aqp1 gene expression was induced following combination of HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting similar BBB disturbances and possible shifts in brain water homeostasis [19]. In line with this, the induction of aquaporins may be linked to neuroinflammation [20,21,22], while the upregulation of additional immune activation markers including Cd74, H2-Ab1, C1ql2 and Ifit-3 were also identified in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, along with hypomethylated Cfi and Mx1, collectively suggesting chronic neuroinflammation may persist during brain readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposure. In response to extracellular cues (i.e., edema), cells rearrange their structures and ion transport proteins to maintain equilibrium [22,23,24]. Furthermore, neuroplasticity is a homeostatic repair mechanism that involves the formation of new synapses and neural processes to compensate for their communication loss following brain infarct, injury or disease [12]. These new formations result in brain restructuring and function, which may be occurring during readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposures. Indeed, our results fall in line with responses that were observed within brains isolated hours post-LDR (10 cGy) exposure, whereby multiple synaptic ion transport genes were altered [25]. Herein, multiple cell structural genes, i.e., Drc7, Dnah7b and Fmnl1 and ion transport genes, i.e., Gria3, Grin2a, Calb2, Scn5a, Clcn5, Kcnj13, Kcnn1 and Kcnh1, were altered post-combination HLU+LDR conditions. Moreover, hypomethylation analyses indicated altered cytoskeletal organization, i.e., Ndel1, Cald1 and Lmod3 were observed in both LDR and HLU, suggesting cellular structural changes involved in neuroplasticity and readaptation processes are active, in order to restructure and/or maintain brain homeostasis. Tight junctions, including claudins, connexins, and occludins contribute to BBB permeability and maintenance. A reduction in these molecules has been implicated in acute BBB disruption in neuroviral [26] and neuroinflammatory diseases [27]. In line with this, Cdh12 was downregulated, whereas, Cldn2 was induced in combination of HLU+LDR. Furthermore, Cdhr4 was hypomethylated in both LDR alone and HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, while Cdhr2 was hypomethylated in LDR and HLU alone, but not in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting BBB restructuring, and further indicating the dynamic process of brain physiology during readaptation. Adult neurogenesis is a process of neural and glia self-renewal and the generation of progenitor cells from radial glial cells (RGCs) within the subventricular and subgranular zones of the hippocampus [28]. RGCs are quiescent and are activated to initiate neurogenesis in response to a stimulus [29], such as LDR [17,30] or models of increased intracranial pressure [31,32]. Indeed, the majority of highly upregulated DEGs post-combination HLU+LDR were involved in HPA signaling, neuropeptide growth factors, and neurogenesis, i.e., Otp, Uncx, Ucn3, Avp, Pmch, Prox1, Calb2, Tbr-1, and Hcrt. While the magnitude of gene expression does not always result in observable phenotypes, these notable DEGs may serve an important purpose in neuromaintenance during readaptation. Interestingly, Crh, a stress-induced hormone, was hypermethylated post-exposure to LDR and combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, implying transcriptional silencing of Crh may be engaged to suppress robust HPA activity during readaptation, which warrants further studies. Readaptation results from combined exposures to HLU+LDR are in agreement with literature that spaceflight can alter neurofunction. Indeed, neurocognitive and behavioral effects via altered decision making, problem solving, visual perceptions, motor controls, and sleep–wake cycles have all been identified in flight [5]. While “space-brain” characteristics have suggested astronauts are at risk of developing neurological sequelae in flight [33] and post-flight [6,7]. Due to the limitations of human neurological studies, mouse models provide an excellent alternative, with the caveat that fluid shifts in mice are marginal in comparison to their human counterparts. Therefore, follow-up studies utilizing larger mammals, i.e., rats, may provide more robust responses. Further, readaptation effects from radiation have been described to cause differential nervous system responses in sex, age, type of irradiation, duration of exposure and total doses [1,12,34], while the readaptation effects of prolonged HLU on the neurohealth of different sexes and age groups are still unclear. Therefore, future studies approaching these additional demographics, both modeled in mice or rats, are required. Nonetheless, our readaptation study in mice exposed to combined HLU+LDR displayed a panel of neurological changes that were translational to humans, suggesting this is a suitable animal model to study spaceflight-related readaptation effects on the nervous system. Additionally, future studies should expand the types of radiation exposure animals experience in order to fully capture the spectrum of radiation that bombards astronauts during spaceflight. The space radiation environment beyond LEO contains several types of ionizing radiation. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) with relatively high linear energy transfer (LET) and proton radiation due to solar particle events (SPEs) contribute a significant portion of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3]. High-energy heavy ions (HZE radiation) can produce distinct patterns of energy deposition in cells and tissues [13,35]. However, secondary particles produced by the interaction of SPE protons and heavy-charged GCR particles with the spacecraft structure include γ-rays and x-rays [3]. These radiation sources can also deliver a significant fraction of the total mission dose and pose a hazard to astronauts’ health [15]. For chronic irradiation exposure, we used flood sources consisting of plastic sheets embedded with the isotope 57Co that emits medium energy (122 and 136 keV) γ-rays. Additional research is needed to elucidate the CNS damage and readaptation response induced by the full spectrum of space radiation. In summary, a multitude of neurological effects and persistent brain transcriptional alterations were observed at 4 months post-HLU+LDR in 21-day exposures. Changes included reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and signaling genes. Thus, brain-related transcriptional changes are dynamic and plastic during readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions, and while these exposures may lead to long-term neurological consequences, the active processes of neuroplasticity and repair are engaged to maintain neural homeostasis.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animals Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory), as previously reported [10], were utilized in this report. Upon arrival, they were acclimatized for 7 days in standard habitats at 20 °C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Commercial pellet chow and hydrogel were available ad libitum. Animal health status, water and food intake were monitored daily. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [36] and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028).4.2. Experimental Conditions Following acclimatization, animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (n = 3); (2) hindlimb unloaded (HLU) (n = 6); (3) low-dose irradiated (LDR) (n = 6); and (4) combination hindlimb unloaded and low-dose irradiated (HLU+LDR) (n = 4) for 21 days. Post-experimental exposure animals were group housed (3 per cage) for up to 4 months (4M).4.3. Hindlimb Unloading and Whole-Body Irradiation Hindlimb-unloaded animals (HLU) were treated as previously described [37], with animals maintained at a 35–40 head-down tilt with the hindlimbs elevated above the bottom of the cage. LDR gamma irradiation was performed by placing 57Co plates (185 MBq activity; GPI, Stoughton, WI) under the cages (1 plate per 2 cages). These cobalt plates deliver chronic low-dose/low-dose-rate γ-ray irradiation. A total dose of 0.04 Gy was delivered at a rate of 0.01 cGy/h over 21 days. HLU+LDR animals were both unloaded and irradiated as described here. Control animals received no treatment. All animals were handled similarly.4.4. Euthanasia, Dissection, Tissue Storage, and Nucleic Acid Extraction Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2 followed by immediate exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately after euthanasia brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres, with the brainstem and cerebellum removed. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue homogenization was performed using the Tissue homogenizing CKMix (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) on a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). RNA and DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C.4.5. RNA Sequencing The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–96 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used per manufacturer’s instructions to construct RNA-Seq libraries. A total of 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA spiked with 1 µL of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Barcodes with unique indices out of 96 indices, were used per sample for multiplexing. Strand selection was performed using a custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice (NuGEN Technologies). Libraries were amplified by PCR with 17 cycles on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA). These libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Mira Loma, CA, USA) to generate 15–30 M 75-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14].4.6. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) The RRBS library was constructed with 100 ng of gDNA as input using Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation followed by ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. The ligation products were finally repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C for 10 min, 70 °C for 10 min, held at 4 °C). The product of the final repair reaction was used for bisulfite conversion using the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). The RRBS libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 at Loma Linda Center for Genomics to generate 15–55 M 70-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14].4.7. Differential Expression and Pathway Enrichment Analysis Sequencing reads were first trimmed with Cutadapt [38] using the Trim Galore! wrapper. Reads were mapped with STAR [39], expression quantified with RSEM [40] and tximport [41] was used to import counts into DESeq2 [42] for the detection of differentially expressed genes. Log2 fold-change and adjusted p-value cutoffs of 0.263 and 0.05 were used, respectively. Enriched GO terms were detected with WebGestalt [43] using the biological process database. Enriched pathways were detected with Reactome version 67 [44] using an overrepresentation analysis and the full list of DEGs. Human pathways were found using Reactome’s “Project to human” option. Heatmaps were generated using the webtool Morpheus, from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) by performing hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance. The volcano plots in Figure 2 were generated with the R package EnhancedVolcano. The UpSet diagram in Figure 4 was generated using Intervene [16].4.8. Differential Methylation Analysis Sequencing reads were first trimmed with Cutadapt [38] using the Trim Galore! wrapper using the “--RRBS” flag before processing with the “bismark” and “bismark_methylation_extractor” scripts from Bismark [45]. The differential methylation of gene bodies and promoters was performed with RnBeads version 1.10.8 and R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation, Boston, MA, USA) [46]. The combined ranking score was utilized to detect differential methylation. It combines absolute and relative effect sizes as well as p-values from statistical modeling into a single score.Acknowledgments The authors thank the NASA GeneLab Analysis Working Group for useful discussion.

    "abstract": "Abstract Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

    "introduction": "Introduction We are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality1. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized2,3. In humans, one of the most apparent physiological responses to the space environment is the redistribution of fluid throughout the body that occurs due to microgravity. This redistribution shifts fluid upward from the lower parts of the body4. An increased intracranial pressure caused by this fluid shift has been attributed as a major cause of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)5. 40% of astronauts have experienced SANS6, including the spaceflight subject of the NASA twins study7. The physiological impact of SANS encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening (GF), choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)5,8. While the physiological characteristics of SANS are well documented, the mechanisms that drive SANS are still poorly understood. To date, despite evidence showing ocular functioning impairment following exposure to the space environment, few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms involved in the spaceflight-associated changes in retinal structure and function. A previous study from our group characterized the effects of a 13-day exposure to the space environment aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) in mice. This study found that spaceflight conditions induced oxidative damage that resulted in mitochondrial apoptosis in the mouse retina2. Subsequent work with low-dose proton radiation and a simulated microgravity mice model showed a major role of simulated space radiation in the increase of oxidative stress, with synergistic effects when simulated microgravity was applied9,10. In our current study, mice were exposed to the space environment for 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed to spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Flight and control conditions SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission in August, 2017. 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same special NASA food bar diet as the space flown mice. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. The study followed the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health () and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Post-flight evaluation of the mice Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. It was reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities as described by the inspecting personnel. Dissecting and preservation of mouse eyes after spaceflight The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38+/−4 hours of splashdown (n = 20/group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: ground control and spaceflight (n = 8 mice per group) were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for genomic analysis. Immunostaining assays and histology Paraffin-embedded sections (Six µm) of left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n = 6/group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, Immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX) at 4 °C for 2 hours followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA) for 2 hours at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Peanut agglutinin (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18-21 hours) at 4 °C with primary antibody against rabbit anti-4-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX). After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). PNA was obtained from (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). To characterize layers of retinal structure, a series of 6 µm sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images were captured with a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope. In each sample, a total of 5 fields of images were sampled systematically at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections. Quantification of immunostaining For quantitative analysis, the number of PNA- positive cells were counted in three sections of tissue from each animal using Image J counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The density profiles were expressed as mean number of PNA cells/mm2, and counts were averaged across each group. To determine HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 5 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using Image J software. The data were extracted and averaged within the group. A detailed method was described in Mao et al.2. Sample preparation for MicroCT scanning A subset of eye samples (n = 6/group) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the mice eyes were dehydrated in ethanol. To prevent an abrupt shrinkage of the fixed sample, a graded series of ethanoic solutions were used. Afterwards, the mice eyes were stained in 10% phosphomolybdic acid solution (PMA) for 6 days. Samples were washed in absolute ethanol and then placed each eye in the same rotation in individual 2 mL plastic containers filled with absolute ethanol for scanning. Micro CT scanning and analysis Samples were scanned using a high resolution micro-computed tomography system (SkyScan 1272 desktop micro-CT system, Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with an accelerating source voltage of 50 keV, a source current of 80 mA with an integration time of 90 min. During the scanning process, the samples were rotated at 180 degrees, with an imaging voxel size of 4.5 um, frame averaging of 4, rotation step of 0.4 and no filter. These images were saved for the reconstruction of the 3D object. The thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues were measured on MicroCT images by descriptive analysis. Measurements of the lens, retina, RPE layer, choroid and sclera were performed in the middle slice of the sagittal view of each sample using the optical nerve as reference. Three measurements were recorded of each structure to finally obtain an average. RNA/DNA extraction Retina tissues (n = 8/group) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 600 µl of RLT plus buffer. Total RNA and DNA were extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified and purity checked by NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape with 1ul of randomly selected RNA denatured at 72 °C for three minutes per manufacturer’s instructions (Santa Clara, CA). RNA integrity numbers (RIN) of tested RNA samples had values between 7.7 and 8.9. RNA-Seq library construction The Ovation® Mouse RNA-Seq System 1-16 (NuGEN Technologies, #0348) was used per manufacturer’s instructions to construct stranded RNA-seq libraries. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA (100 ng) spiked with 1 µl of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). 130 µl of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer’s instructions. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 °C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA depletion. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads. Library quantification and quality control (QC) test The final amplified libraries were purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quality and peak size was determined using D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Sequencing Final libraries were each diluted to 4 nM and further quantitated to ensure high accuracy quantification for consistent pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of the number of clusters in the Illumina flow cell. Libraries of different indices were pooled for sequencing together in equimolar amounts. Pooled libraries were quantified by Qubit prior to sequencing. For sequencing, clusters were generated on cBot with HiSeq3000/4000 PE cluster kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) from 5 ul of 2 nM final library pool (200 pM at cBot loading). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics) using 75 cycles SBS reagents (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Single-indexed and single-end reads with 75 nucleotides length (1 × 75 bp) were generated. Fastq files generated from the sequence run were demultiplexed (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics), quality checked (quality score >38), trimmed from adapters with Trimmomatic (version 0.01) and mapped against mouse reference genome (_build_37.2) with TOPHAT2 (version 2). Overall mapping rate was ~85%. Expressed transcripts were counted with Multi HTSeq (version 0.02). Computational pipeline/RNA-Seq analysis tools Differential Expression analysis was carried out using raw counts from input to the R package DEseq2 Version 1.22.2 using R version 3.5.1. A gene was considered differentially expressed (DE) if was below a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of 0.163. Heatmaps were generated using the webtool Morpheus, from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). Hierarchical clustering was performed on rows and columns using one minus Pearson correlation. DEGs that are transcription factors were annotated using the Panther database version 14.119. GO, gene network analysis, and phenotype graphs were created by performing an overrepresentation enrichment analysis using WebGestalt12. GO analysis was carried out using biological process database. Gene network analysis was carried out using the Reactome database64. Phenotype analysis was carried out using mammalian phenotype ontology. FDRs were calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Human disease associated genes were found for the diseases retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment using the database DisGeNET version 6.0 with a gene-disease association (GDA) score greater than 0.217. Human genes were converted to their mouse orthologs using the Mouse Genome Informatics database18. The genes KIZ, PCARE, RP2, and RP9 did not have their orthologs listed in the Mouse Genome Informatics database and were manually annotated using the GeneCards database (v4.10.0 Build 4)65.",
    "results": "Results The space environment causes changes in gene expression related to visual and RNA regulation pathways The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing. Twenty mice spent 35 days on the International Space Station as part of NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). An additional twenty mice were housed on Earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. RNA sequencing was performed on sixteen mice (n = 8/group). 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using DESeq211 with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 (Sup. Table 1). Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DEGs according to their expression values to determine which mice have similar DEG expression profiles. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group. The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control (Fig. 1A). Figure 1. Open in a new tab DEG clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice. (A) Hierarchical clustering of the 600 DEGs between spaceflight and control mice using an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.1. The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DEGs. The affinity propagation option from WebGestalt was applied to the select representative display categories; (C) Enriched networks among DEGs from the Reactome database; (D) Enriched phenotypes impacted by the DEGs from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology; (B–D) Overrepresented categories were found relating to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’).An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO), pathway, and phenotypic categories was performed on the DEGs using WebGestalt12. From this analysis, 46 GO, 5 pathway, and 14 phenotypic categories were found with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 (Fig. 1B–D, Sup. Table 2). Included in the overrepresented categories are categories related to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’). Some genes were highly differentially expressed, but were not included in any of the GO category, pathway, or phenotype gene lists from the ORA (Sup. Fig. 1). Drd4 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene and was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812). Drd4 is a dopamine receptor that control circadian rhythm in the mammalian retina13. Similarly, Hist1h2bc was not found in any categories of the ORA, but was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 1.66E-09; log2 fold-change: 0.526). Hist1h2bc has been previously shown to be upregulated in the aging retina14. Together, these genes support previous studies suggesting that spaceflight disrupts circadian rhythms and is a potential model for aging15,16. Genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa are differentially expressed in the space environment We sought to determine whether any of the DEGs from the spaceflight samples were also differentially expressed in common retinal diseases. We compiled a list of disease-associated genes for the following retinal diseases: retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. Human disease-associated gene lists were found using the DisGeNET database17. Genes in the DisGeNET database were filtered by their gene-disease association score (GDA). Only genes with a GDA greater than 0.2 were included in the analysis. This included disease-associated genes from expertly curated and animal model databases, but excluded disease-associated genes from inferences and text-mining databases. Disease-associated genes were converted to their mouse ortholog using the Mouse Genome Informatics database18. Genes that did not pass the DESeq2 threshold for the number of mean counts (i.e., they had an adjusted p-value equal to ‘NA’), were filtered out from the analysis. Present in the DisGeNet database were 75 genes associated with the disease retinitis pigmentosa, 14 genes with diabetic retinopathy, 8 genes with age-related macular degeneration, and 5 genes with retinal detachment (Sup. Table 3). Most of the disease-associated genes were unique to a single retinal disease, with the exception of Abca4, Nmnat1, Casp3, and Crb1, which were each shared across two diseases (Fig. 2A). None of the disease-associated genes that were shared across multiple diseases were differentially expressed in spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Retinal disease-associated gene expression. (A) UpSet diagram showing the number of genes in each disease set from DisGeNet. Genes that are distinct to each set are in the first four columns. Genes shared among sets are in the last three columns; (B) Log2 fold-change values of disease-associated genes. Genes are plotted from left to right in order of adjusted p-value. Bars are colored by the magnitude of the adjusted p-value. Adjusted p-values are further annotated based on their order of magnitude. The plot for retinitis pigmentosa displays the top 20 most significant genes based on adjusted p-value. All other diseases are displaying all of their associated genes.Of the 75 genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa, 12 were differentially expressed during spaceflight (Sag, BC027072/Pcare, Guca1b, Rbp3, Ahi1, Guca1a, Prpf8, Rp1, Gucy2e, Cacna2d4, Pde6b, Dhdds), the most of any of the four retinal diseases examined. Diabetic retinopathy had one disease-associated gene that was differentially expressed during spaceflight (Hif1a). Age-related macular degeneration and retinal detachment disease-associated genes were not differentially expressed during spaceflight (Fig. 2B). Differentially expressed transcription factors hint that spaceflight changes chromatin organization DEGs reported in Fig. 1A were filtered by their PANTHER protein class in order to find differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs)19. Out of the 600 DEGs, 29 are DETFs. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DETFs according to their expression values. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group (Fig. 3A). Eight of the DETFs are necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye: Mafg, Isl1, Atf5, Kdm6b, Hmgb3, Prox1, Casz1 and Hif1a20–27. Of special interest are Cazs1 and Hif1a. Cazs1 is a heterochromatin regulator that acts in a splice-variant specific manner24 and Hif1a inactivation has been shown to significantly mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in a chronic hypoxia-like stress model25. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcription factor clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice. (A) Hierarchical clustering of the 29 DETFs between spaceflight and ground control mice; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DETFs.An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO) terms was performed on the DETFs. 47 GO categories were found with an FDR of less than 0.05 (Sup. Table 4). The affinity propagation filter from WebGestalt was applied in order to find a reduced number of GO terms that are representative of all GO enrichment results. We found enrichment of GO categories related to DNA transcription (‘positive regulation of transcription’, DNA-templated, ‘negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated’), further affirming the role of these genes as transcription factors. Additionally, there were enriched GO categories relating to chromatin organization, including regulation of histone modification, histone lysine demethylation, negative regulation of histone H3K9 trimethylation (Fig. 3B). The genes in these GO categories include Kdm4a, Kdm4b, and Kdm6b, which are known regulators of lysine methylation. Kdm4a and Kdm4b are regulators of H3K9me2/me328, which is a regulator of constitutive heterochromatin and an indicator for the presence of constitutive heterochromatin. Kdm6b is a regulator of H3K27me2/me328 and is primarily responsible for the silencing of gene expression. The space environment decreases the thickness of retinal tissue and increases oxidative stress and cone photoreceptor damage Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) images were generated in order to characterize global ocular morphology and to measure the thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues for ground control and spaceflight mice (Fig. 4A). Total retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid layers of the eye decreased significantly in thickness (p < 0.05) during spaceflight (Fig. 4B). Additionally, choroid deformation and folds were noticed in spaceflight mice (Fig. 4C). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight decreases the thickness of multiple layers of the eye. (A) Sagittal view of a ground control mouse. Layers of the eye on the right side of the image are annotated, from top-to-bottom, retina (0.077 mm), retina pigment layer (RPE, 0.038 mm), choroid (0.041 mm), sclera (0.059 mm); (B) Average thickness of the retinal layer, RPE layer, and the choroid layer measured by MicroCT in the spaceflight and control groups. Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values were represented as mean thickness + standard error (SEM). SEM of the mean is marked with error bars. Significantly lower in cross section thickness in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group is denoted ‘*’ (p < 0.05). (C) Cross sections of the retina from control and spaceflight mice. GCL: ganglion cell layer; INL: inner nuclear layer; ONL: outer nuclear layer; IS: inner segment; OS: outer segment, RPE: pigment epithelium layer.Immunofluorescence staining with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a specific marker for cone photoreceptors, was performed in order to view cone photoreceptors in the eye. Cone photoreceptors show signs of degradation during spaceflight (Fig. 5A). Our quantitative assessment (Fig. 5B) revealed a strong trend decrease in density of cones in the spaceflight mice (950 counts/mm2) compared to ground control group that had an average of 1199 counts/mm2 (p = 0.06). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight causes photoreceptor degradation and oxidative stress.

Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker in the photoreceptor layer of rods and cones (arrow); (E) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker across the retina; (F) Log2 fold-change of DEGs under the GO category “negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death”; (B,D,E) Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM. Significance values of the spaceflight group compared to ground controls are denoted with ‘*’ (p < 0.05), ‘**’ (p < 0.01), and ‘T’ (strong trend differences between spaceflight and ground controls; p = 0.06).The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with antibody against 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina. Increased 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) after spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D, the fluorescent intensity profiles in the photoreceptor cones which reflects endogenous level of HNE, was also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the spaceflight group compared to the ground controls. Fluorescent intensity from the HNE marker was also significantly increased in the GCL/INL of the spaceflight group for the retina (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5E). Our RNA-seq experiment identified three DEGs - Pde8a, Hif1a, Hgf - that are part of the GO Biological Process category for ‘negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death’ (GO:1903202) (Fig. 5F). Pde8a is a member of the phosphodiesterase family. Phosphodiesterase specific member inhibition has been previously shown to attenuates oxidative stress in diverse tissues29–32. Hif1a was shown to protect against oxidative stress directly at the mitochondria33, but the effects of this gene were shown to be highly contextual in the presence of reactive oxygen species34. Hgf activates an antioxidant signaling pathway that culminates in increased levels of nitric oxide and the activity of antioxidant enzymes regulated by this molecule35,36. Taken together, the upregulation of Pde8a and the downregulation of the Hif1a and Hgf are linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We have found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Other studies have also shown changes of gene expression involved in cell structure, growth, migration and adhesion in the retinal cells exposed to simulated microgravity37,38. Less anticipated was the overrepresentation of genes related to RNA processing, metabolism, and transport pathways for the first time described as relevant for spaceflight in mammals. A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has discovered mRNA isoforms created by alternative splicing that are unique to their spaceflight exposed samples39. Our results indicate that in addition to Arabidopsis thaliana, there may be splice isoform alterations in mammals during spaceflight as well that should be explored in future work and included in the risk assessment for long duration space missions. Differential RNA splicing has also been implicated as a potential disease-causing mechanism for retinitis pigmentosa. Mutations in the gene Rho, which creates a protein that composes rod photoreceptors and is essential for vision in low-light conditions, can alter its splice isoforms. These alternate isoforms lead to the construction of abnormal RHO proteins and trigger the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa40. Additionally, proper alternative splicing of Nxnl1 from rod photoreceptors and other ocular cell types has been associated with cone photoreceptor maintenance41,42. Disruption of these splice isoforms can reduce the density of cone photoreceptors and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina43. Overall, our results indicate that the space environment might create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, in addition to the altered gene expression profile reported. Future studies should address which genes are alternatively spliced to understand potential changes in protein structure and find further associations with retinal diseases. Furthermore, mouse models for retinitis pigmentosa are available. Determining which mouse model is most similar to mice exposed to the space environment will help determine the appropriate model to perform Earth-analog experiments. Finding an appropriate Earth-based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight. Several transcription factors were identified as necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye20. Although eight of the DETFs are known for their importance for the retinal development and maintenance in Earth conditions, 21 of the DETFs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. From the DETF overrepresentation analysis, transcription factors were identified that are known to influence chromatin architecture. Changes in chromatin architecture indicate that the cause for changes in retinal structure observed during spaceflight is more complex than solely alterations in RNA processing. The overrepresentation analysis showed enrichment of transcriptional regulators for H3K9 demethylation, which is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin. Demethylation of H3K9 can result in the unraveling of this heterochromatin, which can then influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome44. This can further drive changes in gene expression and either create abnormal and potentially harmful cellular behavior or act as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate damage the retinal tissue has experienced from spaceflight. The connections between chromatin reorganization as a disease-causing or disease-mitigating mechanism during spaceflight has not yet been explored. Determining the locations of chromatin reorganization could provide insight to these questions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets. Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate cellular damage have been observed in response to oxidative stress. Our immunostaining for marker 4-HNE showed evidence of oxidative stress within the retina. Evidence of a response to this oxidative stress was also observed in the gene expression data. The gene Bnip3 was differentially expressed, showing upregulation during spaceflight (adjusted p-value: 2.94E-03; log2 fold-change: 0.309). Bnip3 is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell45. Misfolded proteins can occur as a result of oxidative stress. Also upregulated in the spaceflight data are heat shock genes Hsp90aa1, Hsp90b1, and Hspa4l which can assist correct protein folding and are known to protect against oxidative stress46,47. From this, we see evidence of a potential compensatory mechanism becoming activated in spaceflight in order to correct and mitigate cellular damage accumulating in retinal tissue. One consideration for long duration space missions are the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the space environment. For long duration missions, it becomes imperative to evaluate for how long these compensatory mechanisms can be sustained and how to extend or amplify its beneficial effects. Additionally, the nearest Earth-analog disease that we identified, retinitis pigmentosa, has known links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression48 and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage. We also found evidence that the circadian rhythm of the retina was altered in spaceflight. The circadian rhythm regulates behavioral and physiological processes over a 24-hour period, principally controlled by day/night patterns. Disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to irregular sleep patterns, mood, and metabolism function, as well as the development of cancer49. The differentially expressed gene with the smallest adjusted p-value, Drd4 (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812), is a dopamine receptor that has been associated with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, Drd4 downregulates the gene Adcy113, which was also found to be differentially expressed in this study (adjusted p-value: 1.45E-09; log2 fold-change: −0.427). Adcy1 produces cyclic AMP, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors50–52. Circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where day/night light signals are irregular. For example, astronauts aboard the ISS will experience up to 16 sunsets and sunrises a day53. However, the mice in our experiment were in constant 12-h light/dark cycle, which leads us to believe that events other than the light/dark cycle itself are driving the changes in the circadian rhythm. Increased photoreceptor cone damage, reduced thickness of the retinal ONL, retinal INL, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye in the spaceflight group compared to ground control were reported in our study. Proton radiation-induced damage to the photoreceptor layer was also observed in our previous rodent study54. It is important to note that changes in global ocular structure and retinal layer thickness could have clinical and/or pathological significance34. The ONL contains the nuclei of the photoreceptor cells and the INL contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and Müller cells. Our published study from a Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) showed a significant increase of apoptosis in the ONL and INL of the photoreceptor layer in spaceflight mice2. Photoreceptor loss is responsible for irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases55 and photoreceptors are more sensitive to environmental damage56. Retinal damage, retinal photoreceptor cell loss, and thinning of the inner retina precede subsequent capillary degeneration57,58. Our findings strongly implicate the space environment causes retinal injury and the potential development and progression of retinal degeneration. The potential benefit of micro-CT in quantitative evaluation of ophthalmologic structure was encouraging. Our results showed degradation in ocular structures by spaceflight, particularly of the retina, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye, as evidenced by their decreased thickness. MicroCT provides an easy and non-destructive technique to image without any modification. Additionally, it shows the entire region of interest digitally, thereby increasing accessibility and reproducibility of the findings. Future work should use volumetric data to perform other analyses that take advantage of the micro-CT imaging capabilities, since it has been used successfully for studying many normal and pathologic tissues59. One area of concern is whether observed degradation of photoreceptors, retinal damage, and ocular structure alteration will persist or whether it will reverse once the organism is returned to Earth. Future studies should investigate the long-term impact of observed structural changes of the retina and retinal photoreceptors function that may lead to late retinal degeneration. Additional studies are needed to determine which aspects of spaceflight are responsible for photoreceptor damage and oxidative stress. Leading causes include radiation and possible alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) or intraocular pressure (IOP)60,61 induced by microgravity. It is possible that both space radiation and microgravity work in conjunction with one another to cause a more severe pathological result than either would in isolation. Other factors that may be driving differential gene expression include increased stress an organism experiences due to the physiological pressures of spacecraft takeoff and landing and the psychological pressures of spaceflight. The body size of an organism also impacts the amount of interstitial fluid per gram of body weight, which could impact the magnitude of fluctuating pressures influencing the retina62. Studies using larger organisms could better model the degree of fluctuating pressures experienced by humans during spaceflight. There are many potential avenues left to explore in order to understand the response of the mammalian retina to spaceflight. In this study we have characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers. We have also observed several genes with significant differential expression in the spaceflight condition were also differentially expressed in the disease retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, we suspect the changes that we are observing during spaceflight are influenced by alternative splicing and chromatin reorganization. There remains much work to be done on understanding the mechanism of spaceflight-induced oxidative stress on retinal damage. Additional work will need to be done to separate disease-causing changes in gene expression from compensatory changes. We also believe these data will be useful for understanding other spaceflight-related health concerns, such as misregulation of the circadian rhythm and accelerated aging. A full list of DEGs has been provided as a resource (Sup. Table 1) toward further understanding of associations between spaceflight, retinal function, and overall mammalian health.",

Copyright notice ID: 6746706 PMID: 31527661 Abstract Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment. Subject terms: Transcriptomics, Transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, Gene expression, Experimental models of diseaseIntroduction We are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality1. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized2,3. In humans, one of the most apparent physiological responses to the space environment is the redistribution of fluid throughout the body that occurs due to microgravity. This redistribution shifts fluid upward from the lower parts of the body4. An increased intracranial pressure caused by this fluid shift has been attributed as a major cause of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)5. 40% of astronauts have experienced SANS6, including the spaceflight subject of the NASA twins study7. The physiological impact of SANS encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening (GF), choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)5,8. While the physiological characteristics of SANS are well documented, the mechanisms that drive SANS are still poorly understood. To date, despite evidence showing ocular functioning impairment following exposure to the space environment, few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms involved in the spaceflight-associated changes in retinal structure and function. A previous study from our group characterized the effects of a 13-day exposure to the space environment aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) in mice. This study found that spaceflight conditions induced oxidative damage that resulted in mitochondrial apoptosis in the mouse retina2. Subsequent work with low-dose proton radiation and a simulated microgravity mice model showed a major role of simulated space radiation in the increase of oxidative stress, with synergistic effects when simulated microgravity was applied9,10. In our current study, mice were exposed to the space environment for 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed to spaceflight.Results The space environment causes changes in gene expression related to visual and RNA regulation pathways The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing. Twenty mice spent 35 days on the International Space Station as part of NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). An additional twenty mice were housed on Earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. RNA sequencing was performed on sixteen mice (n = 8/group). 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using DESeq211 with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 (Sup. Table 1). Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DEGs according to their expression values to determine which mice have similar DEG expression profiles. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group. The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control (Fig. 1A). Figure 1. Open in a new tab DEG clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice. (A) Hierarchical clustering of the 600 DEGs between spaceflight and control mice using an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.1. The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DEGs. The affinity propagation option from WebGestalt was applied to the select representative display categories; (C) Enriched networks among DEGs from the Reactome database; (D) Enriched phenotypes impacted by the DEGs from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology; (B–D) Overrepresented categories were found relating to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’).An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO), pathway, and phenotypic categories was performed on the DEGs using WebGestalt12. From this analysis, 46 GO, 5 pathway, and 14 phenotypic categories were found with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 (Fig. 1B–D, Sup. Table 2). Included in the overrepresented categories are categories related to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’). Some genes were highly differentially expressed, but were not included in any of the GO category, pathway, or phenotype gene lists from the ORA (Sup. Fig. 1). Drd4 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene and was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812). Drd4 is a dopamine receptor that control circadian rhythm in the mammalian retina13. Similarly, Hist1h2bc was not found in any categories of the ORA, but was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 1.66E-09; log2 fold-change: 0.526). Hist1h2bc has been previously shown to be upregulated in the aging retina14. Together, these genes support previous studies suggesting that spaceflight disrupts circadian rhythms and is a potential model for aging15,16.Genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa are differentially expressed in the space environment We sought to determine whether any of the DEGs from the spaceflight samples were also differentially expressed in common retinal diseases. We compiled a list of disease-associated genes for the following retinal diseases: retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. Human disease-associated gene lists were found using the DisGeNET database17. Genes in the DisGeNET database were filtered by their gene-disease association score (GDA). Only genes with a GDA greater than 0.2 were included in the analysis. This included disease-associated genes from expertly curated and animal model databases, but excluded disease-associated genes from inferences and text-mining databases. Disease-associated genes were converted to their mouse ortholog using the Mouse Genome Informatics database18. Genes that did not pass the DESeq2 threshold for the number of mean counts (i.e., they had an adjusted p-value equal to ‘NA’), were filtered out from the analysis. Present in the DisGeNet database were 75 genes associated with the disease retinitis pigmentosa, 14 genes with diabetic retinopathy, 8 genes with age-related macular degeneration, and 5 genes with retinal detachment (Sup. Table 3). Most of the disease-associated genes were unique to a single retinal disease, with the exception of Abca4, Nmnat1, Casp3, and Crb1, which were each shared across two diseases (Fig. 2A). None of the disease-associated genes that were shared across multiple diseases were differentially expressed in spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Retinal disease-associated gene expression. (A) UpSet diagram showing the number of genes in each disease set from DisGeNet. Genes that are distinct to each set are in the first four columns. Genes shared among sets are in the last three columns; (B) Log2 fold-change values of disease-associated genes. Genes are plotted from left to right in order of adjusted p-value. Bars are colored by the magnitude of the adjusted p-value. Adjusted p-values are further annotated based on their order of magnitude. The plot for retinitis pigmentosa displays the top 20 most significant genes based on adjusted p-value. All other diseases are displaying all of their associated genes.Of the 75 genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa, 12 were differentially expressed during spaceflight (Sag, BC027072/Pcare, Guca1b, Rbp3, Ahi1, Guca1a, Prpf8, Rp1, Gucy2e, Cacna2d4, Pde6b, Dhdds), the most of any of the four retinal diseases examined. Diabetic retinopathy had one disease-associated gene that was differentially expressed during spaceflight (Hif1a). Age-related macular degeneration and retinal detachment disease-associated genes were not differentially expressed during spaceflight (Fig. 2B).Differentially expressed transcription factors hint that spaceflight changes chromatin organization DEGs reported in Fig. 1A were filtered by their PANTHER protein class in order to find differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs)19. Out of the 600 DEGs, 29 are DETFs. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DETFs according to their expression values. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group (Fig. 3A). Eight of the DETFs are necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye: Mafg, Isl1, Atf5, Kdm6b, Hmgb3, Prox1, Casz1 and Hif1a20–27. Of special interest are Cazs1 and Hif1a. Cazs1 is a heterochromatin regulator that acts in a splice-variant specific manner24 and Hif1a inactivation has been shown to significantly mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in a chronic hypoxia-like stress model25. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcription factor clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice. (A) Hierarchical clustering of the 29 DETFs between spaceflight and ground control mice; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DETFs.An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO) terms was performed on the DETFs. 47 GO categories were found with an FDR of less than 0.05 (Sup. Table 4). The affinity propagation filter from WebGestalt was applied in order to find a reduced number of GO terms that are representative of all GO enrichment results. We found enrichment of GO categories related to DNA transcription (‘positive regulation of transcription’, DNA-templated, ‘negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated’), further affirming the role of these genes as transcription factors. Additionally, there were enriched GO categories relating to chromatin organization, including regulation of histone modification, histone lysine demethylation, negative regulation of histone H3K9 trimethylation (Fig. 3B). The genes in these GO categories include Kdm4a, Kdm4b, and Kdm6b, which are known regulators of lysine methylation. Kdm4a and Kdm4b are regulators of H3K9me2/me328, which is a regulator of constitutive heterochromatin and an indicator for the presence of constitutive heterochromatin. Kdm6b is a regulator of H3K27me2/me328 and is primarily responsible for the silencing of gene expression.The space environment decreases the thickness of retinal tissue and increases oxidative stress and cone photoreceptor damage Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) images were generated in order to characterize global ocular morphology and to measure the thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues for ground control and spaceflight mice (Fig. 4A). Total retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid layers of the eye decreased significantly in thickness (p < 0.05) during spaceflight (Fig. 4B). Additionally, choroid deformation and folds were noticed in spaceflight mice (Fig. 4C). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight decreases the thickness of multiple layers of the eye. (A) Sagittal view of a ground control mouse. Layers of the eye on the right side of the image are annotated, from top-to-bottom, retina (0.077 mm), retina pigment layer (RPE, 0.038 mm), choroid (0.041 mm), sclera (0.059 mm); (B) Average thickness of the retinal layer, RPE layer, and the choroid layer measured by MicroCT in the spaceflight and control groups. Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values were represented as mean thickness + standard error (SEM). SEM of the mean is marked with error bars. Significantly lower in cross section thickness in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group is denoted ‘*’ (p < 0.05). (C) Cross sections of the retina from control and spaceflight mice. GCL: ganglion cell layer; INL: inner nuclear layer; ONL: outer nuclear layer; IS: inner segment; OS: outer segment, RPE: pigment epithelium layer.Immunofluorescence staining with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a specific marker for cone photoreceptors, was performed in order to view cone photoreceptors in the eye. Cone photoreceptors show signs of degradation during spaceflight (Fig. 5A). Our quantitative assessment (Fig. 5B) revealed a strong trend decrease in density of cones in the spaceflight mice (950 counts/mm2) compared to ground control group that had an average of 1199 counts/mm2 (p = 0.06). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight causes photoreceptor degradation and oxidative stress. (A) Immunofluorescence staining for PNA, a marker for cone photoreceptors (green), and HNE, a marker for oxidative stress (red), in the photoreceptor layer. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue); Scale bar = 50 mm. (B) Cell density for PNA–positive cone photoreceptors; (C) Immunofluorescence staining for HNE (red) in the retina layer. Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker in the photoreceptor layer of rods and cones (arrow); (E) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker across the retina; (F) Log2 fold-change of DEGs under the GO category “negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death”; (B,D,E) Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM. Significance values of the spaceflight group compared to ground controls are denoted with ‘*’ (p < 0.05), ‘**’ (p < 0.01), and ‘T’ (strong trend differences between spaceflight and ground controls; p = 0.06).The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with antibody against 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina. Increased 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) after spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D, the fluorescent intensity profiles in the photoreceptor cones which reflects endogenous level of HNE, was also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the spaceflight group compared to the ground controls. Fluorescent intensity from the HNE marker was also significantly increased in the GCL/INL of the spaceflight group for the retina (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5E). Our RNA-seq experiment identified three DEGs - Pde8a, Hif1a, Hgf - that are part of the GO Biological Process category for ‘negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death’ (GO:1903202) (Fig. 5F). Pde8a is a member of the phosphodiesterase family. Phosphodiesterase specific member inhibition has been previously shown to attenuates oxidative stress in diverse tissues29–32. Hif1a was shown to protect against oxidative stress directly at the mitochondria33, but the effects of this gene were shown to be highly contextual in the presence of reactive oxygen species34. Hgf activates an antioxidant signaling pathway that culminates in increased levels of nitric oxide and the activity of antioxidant enzymes regulated by this molecule35,36. Taken together, the upregulation of Pde8a and the downregulation of the Hif1a and Hgf are linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina.Discussion We have found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Other studies have also shown changes of gene expression involved in cell structure, growth, migration and adhesion in the retinal cells exposed to simulated microgravity37,38. Less anticipated was the overrepresentation of genes related to RNA processing, metabolism, and transport pathways for the first time described as relevant for spaceflight in mammals. A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has discovered mRNA isoforms created by alternative splicing that are unique to their spaceflight exposed samples39. Our results indicate that in addition to Arabidopsis thaliana, there may be splice isoform alterations in mammals during spaceflight as well that should be explored in future work and included in the risk assessment for long duration space missions. Differential RNA splicing has also been implicated as a potential disease-causing mechanism for retinitis pigmentosa. Mutations in the gene Rho, which creates a protein that composes rod photoreceptors and is essential for vision in low-light conditions, can alter its splice isoforms. These alternate isoforms lead to the construction of abnormal RHO proteins and trigger the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa40. Additionally, proper alternative splicing of Nxnl1 from rod photoreceptors and other ocular cell types has been associated with cone photoreceptor maintenance41,42. Disruption of these splice isoforms can reduce the density of cone photoreceptors and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina43. Overall, our results indicate that the space environment might create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, in addition to the altered gene expression profile reported. Future studies should address which genes are alternatively spliced to understand potential changes in protein structure and find further associations with retinal diseases. Furthermore, mouse models for retinitis pigmentosa are available. Determining which mouse model is most similar to mice exposed to the space environment will help determine the appropriate model to perform Earth-analog experiments. Finding an appropriate Earth-based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight. Several transcription factors were identified as necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye20. Although eight of the DETFs are known for their importance for the retinal development and maintenance in Earth conditions, 21 of the DETFs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. From the DETF overrepresentation analysis, transcription factors were identified that are known to influence chromatin architecture. Changes in chromatin architecture indicate that the cause for changes in retinal structure observed during spaceflight is more complex than solely alterations in RNA processing. The overrepresentation analysis showed enrichment of transcriptional regulators for H3K9 demethylation, which is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin. Demethylation of H3K9 can result in the unraveling of this heterochromatin, which can then influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome44. This can further drive changes in gene expression and either create abnormal and potentially harmful cellular behavior or act as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate damage the retinal tissue has experienced from spaceflight. The connections between chromatin reorganization as a disease-causing or disease-mitigating mechanism during spaceflight has not yet been explored. Determining the locations of chromatin reorganization could provide insight to these questions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets. Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate cellular damage have been observed in response to oxidative stress. Our immunostaining for marker 4-HNE showed evidence of oxidative stress within the retina. Evidence of a response to this oxidative stress was also observed in the gene expression data. The gene Bnip3 was differentially expressed, showing upregulation during spaceflight (adjusted p-value: 2.94E-03; log2 fold-change: 0.309). Bnip3 is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell45. Misfolded proteins can occur as a result of oxidative stress. Also upregulated in the spaceflight data are heat shock genes Hsp90aa1, Hsp90b1, and Hspa4l which can assist correct protein folding and are known to protect against oxidative stress46,47. From this, we see evidence of a potential compensatory mechanism becoming activated in spaceflight in order to correct and mitigate cellular damage accumulating in retinal tissue. One consideration for long duration space missions are the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the space environment. For long duration missions, it becomes imperative to evaluate for how long these compensatory mechanisms can be sustained and how to extend or amplify its beneficial effects. Additionally, the nearest Earth-analog disease that we identified, retinitis pigmentosa, has known links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression48 and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage. We also found evidence that the circadian rhythm of the retina was altered in spaceflight. The circadian rhythm regulates behavioral and physiological processes over a 24-hour period, principally controlled by day/night patterns. Disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to irregular sleep patterns, mood, and metabolism function, as well as the development of cancer49. The differentially expressed gene with the smallest adjusted p-value, Drd4 (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812), is a dopamine receptor that has been associated with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, Drd4 downregulates the gene Adcy113, which was also found to be differentially expressed in this study (adjusted p-value: 1.45E-09; log2 fold-change: −0.427). Adcy1 produces cyclic AMP, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors50–52. Circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where day/night light signals are irregular. For example, astronauts aboard the ISS will experience up to 16 sunsets and sunrises a day53. However, the mice in our experiment were in constant 12-h light/dark cycle, which leads us to believe that events other than the light/dark cycle itself are driving the changes in the circadian rhythm. Increased photoreceptor cone damage, reduced thickness of the retinal ONL, retinal INL, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye in the spaceflight group compared to ground control were reported in our study. Proton radiation-induced damage to the photoreceptor layer was also observed in our previous rodent study54. It is important to note that changes in global ocular structure and retinal layer thickness could have clinical and/or pathological significance34. The ONL contains the nuclei of the photoreceptor cells and the INL contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and Müller cells. Our published study from a Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) showed a significant increase of apoptosis in the ONL and INL of the photoreceptor layer in spaceflight mice2. Photoreceptor loss is responsible for irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases55 and photoreceptors are more sensitive to environmental damage56. Retinal damage, retinal photoreceptor cell loss, and thinning of the inner retina precede subsequent capillary degeneration57,58. Our findings strongly implicate the space environment causes retinal injury and the potential development and progression of retinal degeneration. The potential benefit of micro-CT in quantitative evaluation of ophthalmologic structure was encouraging. Our results showed degradation in ocular structures by spaceflight, particularly of the retina, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye, as evidenced by their decreased thickness. MicroCT provides an easy and non-destructive technique to image without any modification. Additionally, it shows the entire region of interest digitally, thereby increasing accessibility and reproducibility of the findings. Future work should use volumetric data to perform other analyses that take advantage of the micro-CT imaging capabilities, since it has been used successfully for studying many normal and pathologic tissues59. One area of concern is whether observed degradation of photoreceptors, retinal damage, and ocular structure alteration will persist or whether it will reverse once the organism is returned to Earth. Future studies should investigate the long-term impact of observed structural changes of the retina and retinal photoreceptors function that may lead to late retinal degeneration. Additional studies are needed to determine which aspects of spaceflight are responsible for photoreceptor damage and oxidative stress. Leading causes include radiation and possible alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) or intraocular pressure (IOP)60,61 induced by microgravity. It is possible that both space radiation and microgravity work in conjunction with one another to cause a more severe pathological result than either would in isolation. Other factors that may be driving differential gene expression include increased stress an organism experiences due to the physiological pressures of spacecraft takeoff and landing and the psychological pressures of spaceflight. The body size of an organism also impacts the amount of interstitial fluid per gram of body weight, which could impact the magnitude of fluctuating pressures influencing the retina62. Studies using larger organisms could better model the degree of fluctuating pressures experienced by humans during spaceflight. There are many potential avenues left to explore in order to understand the response of the mammalian retina to spaceflight. In this study we have characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers. We have also observed several genes with significant differential expression in the spaceflight condition were also differentially expressed in the disease retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, we suspect the changes that we are observing during spaceflight are influenced by alternative splicing and chromatin reorganization. There remains much work to be done on understanding the mechanism of spaceflight-induced oxidative stress on retinal damage. Additional work will need to be done to separate disease-causing changes in gene expression from compensatory changes. We also believe these data will be useful for understanding other spaceflight-related health concerns, such as misregulation of the circadian rhythm and accelerated aging. A full list of DEGs has been provided as a resource (Sup. Table 1) toward further understanding of associations between spaceflight, retinal function, and overall mammalian health.Methods Flight and control conditions SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission in August, 2017. 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same special NASA food bar diet as the space flown mice. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. The study followed the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health () and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Post-flight evaluation of the mice Upon return to the Earth, mice were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) within 28 hours of splashdown. At LLU, animals were removed from the animal enclosure hardware and assessed for survival and health. It was reported that all the mice survived the 35-day space mission and were in good condition, i.e. no obvious deficiencies/abnormalities as described by the inspecting personnel.Dissecting and preservation of mouse eyes after spaceflight The mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 and eyes were collected within 38+/−4 hours of splashdown (n = 20/group). The retinas from rights were dissected and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes from 2 experimental groups: ground control and spaceflight (n = 8 mice per group) were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for genomic analysis.Immunostaining assays and histology Paraffin-embedded sections (Six µm) of left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n = 6/group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, Immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX) at 4 °C for 2 hours followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA) for 2 hours at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. For double labeling of HNE and PNA, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Peanut agglutinin (1:100 in 1% BSA) for an hour at room temperature for labeling the photoreceptor cones. Sections were then incubated overnight (18-21 hours) at 4 °C with primary antibody against rabbit anti-4-HNE (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc. San Antonio, TX). After washing three times in PBS, sections were further treated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon). PNA was obtained from (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard-Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). To characterize layers of retinal structure, a series of 6 µm sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images were captured with a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope. In each sample, a total of 5 fields of images were sampled systematically at 20X magnification spanning the entire retina sections.Quantification of immunostaining For quantitative analysis, the number of PNA- positive cells were counted in three sections of tissue from each animal using Image J counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The density profiles were expressed as mean number of PNA cells/mm2, and counts were averaged across each group. To determine HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 5 randomly selected fields on each section and calculated using Image J software. The data were extracted and averaged within the group. A detailed method was described in Mao et al.2.Sample preparation for MicroCT scanning A subset of eye samples (n = 6/group) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the mice eyes were dehydrated in ethanol. To prevent an abrupt shrinkage of the fixed sample, a graded series of ethanoic solutions were used. Afterwards, the mice eyes were stained in 10% phosphomolybdic acid solution (PMA) for 6 days. Samples were washed in absolute ethanol and then placed each eye in the same rotation in individual 2 mL plastic containers filled with absolute ethanol for scanning.Micro CT scanning and analysis Samples were scanned using a high resolution micro-computed tomography system (SkyScan 1272 desktop micro-CT system, Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with an accelerating source voltage of 50 keV, a source current of 80 mA with an integration time of 90 min. During the scanning process, the samples were rotated at 180 degrees, with an imaging voxel size of 4.5 um, frame averaging of 4, rotation step of 0.4 and no filter. These images were saved for the reconstruction of the 3D object. The thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues were measured on MicroCT images by descriptive analysis. Measurements of the lens, retina, RPE layer, choroid and sclera were performed in the middle slice of the sagittal view of each sample using the optical nerve as reference. Three measurements were recorded of each structure to finally obtain an average.RNA/DNA extraction Retina tissues (n = 8/group) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 600 µl of RLT plus buffer. Total RNA and DNA were extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified and purity checked by NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape with 1ul of randomly selected RNA denatured at 72 °C for three minutes per manufacturer’s instructions (Santa Clara, CA). RNA integrity numbers (RIN) of tested RNA samples had values between 7.7 and 8.9.RNA-Seq library construction The Ovation® Mouse RNA-Seq System 1-16 (NuGEN Technologies, #0348) was used per manufacturer’s instructions to construct stranded RNA-seq libraries. 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA (100 ng) spiked with 1 µl of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). 130 µl of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer’s instructions. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 °C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA depletion. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads.Library quantification and quality control (QC) test The final amplified libraries were purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quality and peak size was determined using D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).Sequencing Final libraries were each diluted to 4 nM and further quantitated to ensure high accuracy quantification for consistent pooling of barcoded libraries and maximization of the number of clusters in the Illumina flow cell. Libraries of different indices were pooled for sequencing together in equimolar amounts. Pooled libraries were quantified by Qubit prior to sequencing. For sequencing, clusters were generated on cBot with HiSeq3000/4000 PE cluster kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) from 5 ul of 2 nM final library pool (200 pM at cBot loading). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics) using 75 cycles SBS reagents (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Single-indexed and single-end reads with 75 nucleotides length (1 × 75 bp) were generated. Fastq files generated from the sequence run were demultiplexed (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics), quality checked (quality score >38), trimmed from adapters with Trimmomatic (version 0.01) and mapped against mouse reference genome (_build_37.2) with TOPHAT2 (version 2). Overall mapping rate was ~85%. Expressed transcripts were counted with Multi HTSeq (version 0.02).Computational pipeline/RNA-Seq analysis tools Differential Expression analysis was carried out using raw counts from input to the R package DEseq2 Version 1.22.2 using R version 3.5.1. A gene was considered differentially expressed (DE) if was below a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of 0.163. Heatmaps were generated using the webtool Morpheus, from the Broad Institute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). Hierarchical clustering was performed on rows and columns using one minus Pearson correlation. DEGs that are transcription factors were annotated using the Panther database version 14.119. GO, gene network analysis, and phenotype graphs were created by performing an overrepresentation enrichment analysis using WebGestalt12. GO analysis was carried out using biological process database. Gene network analysis was carried out using the Reactome database64. Phenotype analysis was carried out using mammalian phenotype ontology. FDRs were calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Human disease associated genes were found for the diseases retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment using the database DisGeNET version 6.0 with a gene-disease association (GDA) score greater than 0.217. Human genes were converted to their mouse orthologs using the Mouse Genome Informatics database18. The genes KIZ, PCARE, RP2, and RP9 did not have their orthologs listed in the Mouse Genome Informatics database and were manually annotated using the GeneCards database (v4.10.0 Build 4)65.Supplementary information Supplementary Figure 1 (154.6KB, pdf) DEGs and Protein Classes (37.4KB, xlsx) WebGestalt Results, DEGs (21.5KB, xlsx) Gene-Disease Associations (21.1KB, xlsx) WebGestalt Results, DETFs (13.8KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements This study was supported by NASA Space Biology grant # NNX15AB41G and LLU Department of Basic Sciences.

    "abstract": "Abstract There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules. Keywords: space radiation, protons, mouse retina, optic nerve head, blood-retinal barrier, fractionation dose, apoptosis, oxidative stress",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Space radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) will pose significant health risks, especially for long-duration lunar and Mars missions. GCR are continuous low-dose-rate exposures composed of approximately 87% protons, 12% helium ions, and 1% high charge, high energy (HZE) particles of Z > 2 and will comprise the majority of space radiation exposure for long- duration missions beyond the Van Allen belts [1]. The space radiation environment also consists of mixtures of high-energy protons and a minor fraction of other ions released from the sun during SPEs. During long-term deep space missions, it is anticipated that multiple SPEs will be encountered. We and others have been studying the effects of space radiation on the ocular tissue in animal models using beams of high-energy protons produced by particle accelerators [2,3,4,5]. Prolonged spaceflight induces physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities in astronauts, collectively defined as the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) [6]. However, the underlying mechanisms of the changes and factors contributing to the development of damage are unclear. Studies have shown that radiation at doses less than 1 Gy induced significant levels of retinal oxidative damage including retinal cell apoptosis [4]. More recent reports showed optical nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optical nerve disc including prelaminar region, lamina cribrosa, and retro-laminar region [7]. The mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of optic disc edema are less known and not well investigated. Recognizing the importance of the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight, we believe that understanding the impact of space radiation on the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) is crucial in assessing the risk to astronauts during long-duration missions, especially for future deep-space missions that will expose astronauts to greater radiation than previously encountered [8]. However, the effects of spaceflight relevant dose and dose rate exposures to protons in the mouse retina and in the ONH have not been previously addressed. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of whole-body proton exposure at a single dose of 0.5 Gy on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retinal and ONH region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated doses for a total dose of 0.5 Gy in 12 equal fractions over 25 days to simulate the chronic exposures in space.",
    "methods": "2. Material and Methods 2.1. Animals and Irradiation with High Energy Protons Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice, each weighing between 30–35 g, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and shipped to Loma Linda University (LLU) in Loma Linda, CA. The animals were maintained under a constant temperature of 68 °F with a 12-h day/night cycle. Chow and water were available ad libitum. After a one-week acclimation period, the mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at a single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractionations for the total dose of 0.5 Gy over 25 days. To simulate a space-like energy distribution of protons, we have used a spread-out Bragg peak set-up. To facilitate frequent use of medical treatment facilities, we selected energies and field modulations that are commonly used in cancer treatment at the J.M. Slater Proton Treatment Facility at Loma Linda University Medical Center, so that dosimetry, beam tuning, and other practical considerations would be relatively routine and reproducible. This facility uses a synchrotron built at Fermi National Laboratory upgraded and operated by Optivus Proton Therapy, Inc. as the Conforma 3000® Proton Beam Treatment System. The operating and dosimetry system is Odessey™ provided by PerMedics, Inc., of San Bernardino, California, USA. Dosimetry is provided by a series of parallel plate ion chambers calibrated to a NIST-traceable thimble ion chamber [9]. Therefore we used a beam of tuned energy 186 MeV and passed the beam through ~12 cm of plastic (“solid water”™) to reduce energy to 140 MeV and a spinning modulator wheel to produce a field of constant dose over a depth of 14 cm resulting in a field of protons with energies from 0 to 140 MeV in approximately equal abundance with high spatial uniformity. The range of LET values in the field is from 0.57 at the entrance to ~21 keV/µm at component Bragg Peaks and samples occupied the first 7.5 cm of the spread-out Bragg peak. Proton exposures were performed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings after patient treatments. The acute exposure was a single exposure to 0.5 Gy while for the fractionated exposures there were 12 fractions each of 4.17 cGy. The acute exposures were 38–43 s long at a dose rate of 0.74 Gy/min (clinical dose rate) while the fractions were 30–37 s long delivered at 1/10th the clinical dose rate at 0.075 Gy/min in 13–16 accelerator spills. Acute exposures were performed only during the 12th irradiation session. For each exposure, there were two 10 × 10 × 7.5 cm ventilated plastic restraint boxes each containing two freely-moving animals from the same cage. The boxes were aligned to a 20 cm circular field target placed on the patient treatment table where the beam passed vertically downward through the target avoiding self-shielding by the animals. Animals were loaded into restraint boxes in the animal care facility and transported by covered cart to the proton treatment area. Small battery-powered fans operated inside the cart to assure adequate air circulation. Total time in restraint boxes was approximately one hour. To assure equal restraint and handling stress across the three treatment groups, sham irradiated mice were subjected to the same restraint and transportation procedures during each of the 12 irradiation sessions. Similarly, acute irradiated animals were restrained and transported during each irradiation session but only exposed to protons during the last session. Total time in restraint boxes for all animals was approximately one hour on each of the twelve procedure days. Restraint stress precautions were driven by post irradiation behavioral testing needs. All procedures were approved by the Radiation Safety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LLU. 2.2. Eye and Retina Preparation At four months after proton exposure and periodic behavioral testing, mice were euthanized and the right eye from each mouse was placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. 2.3. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Dutp Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay Sections were cut coronally through each left eye, and sections were roughly 100 μm apart providing five sections per eye for analysis. The ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Briefly, six μm paraffin-embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA). 2.4. Immunostaining for 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker on ocular sections was performed using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. Six μm sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) at 4 °C for overnight followed by a rabbit anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody ( Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 1.5 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. 2.5. Immunohistochemistry for Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and Vascular Double-Labeling Six μm sections were incubated overnight (18–21 h) at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA) and monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clone GA5 (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) in 0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed three times in PBS and further treated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. 2.6. Immunostaining Assays for Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1) and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) Immunofluorescence staining related to BRB integrity on ocular sections was performed using biomarkers against PECAM-1 and ZO-1. Six µm sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated and, washed in PBS for 20 min. Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) or CD31/PECAM-1 (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) in antibody dilution buffer. After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 h with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. 2.7. Quantification of Immunostaining Six to ten field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ, USA) at 20× magnification spanning the entire retina per section. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. For quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells were counted within the entire retina layer and in the ONH. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear/ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina or ONH were counted in five sections for each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.49v software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/, access date: 1 June 2018) and the density profiles were expressed as a mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. To determine AQP4, ZO-1, and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on six to ten randomly selected fields on the retina or in the ONH of each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across five ocular sections per eye within the group as one experimental value. 2.8. Statistical Analysis The results for the TUNEL assay and IHC were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). Means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. α-level was set at 0.05 for all tests of statistical significance.",

Apoptotic Damage in the Retina Quantitative assessment with TUNEL assay indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the irradiated groups by roughly 65% compared to that in the control group (Figure 1A). The number of TUNEL positive cells was also calculated in the ONH region (Figure 1B). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells was detected in the fractionated group by 50–67% compared to radiation with a single dose and sham controls, respectively (p < 0.05). Figure 1.

A strong trend increases (p = 0.06) in the fractionated dose group was also documented compared to controls (Figure 2B). In ONH (Figure 2C), the level of anti-HNE antibody protein in irradiated groups was significantly higher than controls.

Alteration of BRB Integrity Using Water Channel Protein AQP4, Adhesion Molecule PECAM-1, and Tight Junction Protein ZO-1 AQP4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet, which plays an important role in regulating of water permeability. No significant differences in protein expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker for astrocyte activation, was noted between groups. However, increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the irradiated groups compared with controls in the retina (Figure 3A). The difference in AQP-4 expression was greater in the irradiated retina of an acute single dose (p < 0.05) than that of fractionated one (p = 0.07) (Figure 3B). Low levels of AQP-4 expression were detected in the ONH region for all groups with no significant difference between groups (data not shown). Figure 3.

Protein expression of PECAM-1 and ZO-1 was evaluated in the retina and ONH region. In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells for PECAM-1 were found. In the irradiated retina from both single and fractionated dose groups, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and GCL (Figure 4A). Irradiated groups (single or fractionated doses) showed a significant increase of PECAM immunoreactivity compared to sham control in the retina (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B) and in the ONH region (Figure 4C). In the control retinal tissue, positive ZO-1 staining was apparent in the retinal INL and GCL. Only a few positive cells were found in the retina from irradiated mice (Figure 5A). Decreased ZO-1 expression was detected in the retina for both single and fractioned dose groups compared to controls (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B). However, positive staining for ZO-1 immunoreactivity, as observed in the retina of the control group, was not detected in the ONH region among all groups (data not shown). Figure 4.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion This study demonstrated that 0.5 Gy of proton radiation induced significant changes in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and BRB integrity biomarkers in the mouse retina four months after a dose of 0.5 Gy. There were differential responses between single and fractionated dose schedules in several parameters. Differences related to BRB biomarker distribution were observed between the retina and ONH (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of Biomarker Expressions in The Retina and Optic Nerve Head (ONH).

Radiation increases the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10]. Free radicals initiate a variety of cellular signaling and alter biomarkers that lead to cellular damage. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation [11]. Studies suggest that HNE plays an important role in stress-mediated signaling for cellular damage and in the mechanisms of apoptosis caused by these stress factors [12]. Our observations show increased 4-HNE staining indicative of oxidative damage to the retina and optic nerve after proton radiation exposure compared to controls. The findings were consistent with previous findings in many research models [11,13]. Radiation delivered in fractionation over 25 days showed a smaller level of HNE expression than that of a single dose in the retina and ONH. However, single- and fractionated-dose schedules appear to produce a similar level of apoptosis in the retina, while fractionated dose schedules showed a higher number of apoptotic cell damage in the ONH region. It is the general consensus that for radiotherapy, and for patients who receive high total doses, a hyperfractionated dose produces less damage to normal tissue by permitting dose recovery for damage repair to DNA and other proteins [14]. However, our retina apoptosis data did not indicate that there was substantial repair of injury or dose recovery at a late observation time point of four months, although the total doses that were delivered to the mouse were much lower than the dose delivered to the patients in the radiotherapy. Our previous study also showed that there were no significant differences in retinal endothelial cell density following single or split dose with two equal dose fractions of 8–28 Gy [15]. Evaluation of DNA repair of double-strand breaks in the rabbit retina, confirms that little DNA repair for dose recovery was found in the aged rabbit retinas [16,17], although retinal radiosensitivity of mice may be different compared to that of rats or rabbits. Surprisingly, a higher number of TUNEL positive cells were detected in the fractionated dose group compared to that of acute single dose exposure in the ONH region. One possible explanation is that acute radiation-induced apoptosis in the ONH may precede fractionated doses-induced apoptosis. By four months, the level of apoptotic damage already passes its peak in the retina that received single dose of 0.5 Gy, so it is less pronounced in acute irradiated group than that of fractionated dose group at four months. However, the complex regional difference in response to single and hyperfractionated dose schedule warrant further investigation. The difference in structure, cellular composition, and permeability or BRB property may contribute to the capacity of the tissue to regulate radiation response in the retina and ONH. In the present study, we found that low-dose proton radiation induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. AQP-4, a water channel protein, has an important role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet [18]. The upregulation of AQP-4 in irradiated retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential disruption of barrier integrity and even possible edema formation. PECAM-1 is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes that can be highly induced in response to inflammatory situations, leading to secretion of chemokines and cytokines [19]. PECAM-1 serves as an adhesion-signaling molecule with important roles in inflammation and leukocyte transmigration [20]. It functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to modulate endothelial cell junctional integrity [21] and may serve as a primary coordinator of many signaling pathways involved in cell metabolism and protein expression [22]. Increased expression of PECAM-1 has also been shown to lead to disruption of BRB integrity after retinal vascular injury [23]. Leukocyte migration from the blood into the retinal tissue promotes the breakdown of the BRB [24]. The higher PECAM-1 expression in the retina following radiation exposure observed in our study may facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to changes in the BRB permeability [25]. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on tight junctions (TJs). Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins and peripheral cytoplasmic proteins. ZO-1 is peripheral cytoplasmic protein and is critical in the initial formation, distinct organization, and function of TJs [26,27]. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 [28]. Our previous spaceflight study also showed decreased immunoreactivity of ZO-1 expression in the retina of the flight group compared to the ground controls [29]. Targeted irradiation of mice caused corneal endothelial cell loss, reduction of ZO-1 junctional contacts, and induction of corneal edema [30]. The degradation of TJ-associated proteins in the retina following injury has been also shown to lead to BRB breakdown [18]. In the current study, the decrease in ZO-1 protein expression in the retina together with the increase in water channel protein AQP-4 and adhesion molecules PECAM-1, in conjunction with increased apoptosis, suggests the BRB disturbance and prolonged tissue remodeling due to radiation exposure with single or fractionated dose schedules. More recently, ONH has become one of the focuses in the research surrounding SANS [7]. Edema was observed in the prelaminar ONH in astronauts [31]. These data points to the hypothesis that multiple factors, including fluid shifts, may lead to ONH swelling and associated intraocular alterations [32,33]. Previous human and monkey studies showed that prelaminar ONH has distinct BRB properties when compared to the retina. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ONH lack blood-brain barrier (BBB) proteins and display nonspecific permeability, while the retina has BBB characteristic proteins but lacks permeability biomarkers [34]. Some of our results are in agreement with their findings. In our mouse study, we found that radiation exposure induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. The staining pattern in the ONH differs from that of the retina. Low level positive staining for BRB biomarkers including water channel protein, AQP-4 and TJ protein, ZO-1 in ONH region indicates deficient BRB function, although adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 was present in the ONH. PECAM-1 also plays an important role in mediating trans-endothelial immune cell migration [35] and participates in key inflammatory events [25]. Lack of BRB biomarkers in the ONH may reflect dysregulation of barrier function and vessel integrity that can cause chronic inflammation, rendering more susceptible of this region to environmental insults and pathology of ONH diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate vascular permeability as well as lymphatic and glymphatic clearance related to the accumulation of fluid in the ONH region [36]. In conclusion, we hope that our investigation sheds light on the mechanism of space radiation-induced ocular response. Knowledge gained from this study could aid further approaches toward more effective countermeasures during human space travel. Our long-term goal is to use system biology approach to investigate the association between ophthalmic changes and other organs pathologies in response to ionizing radiation and to facilitate a better understanding of space radiation-induced tissues response and its relationship to health implication that may lead to disease development.",

Copyright notice ID: 8400407 PMID: 34440593 Abstract There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

Introduction Space radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) will pose significant health risks, especially for long-duration lunar and Mars missions. GCR are continuous low-dose-rate exposures composed of approximately 87% protons, 12% helium ions, and 1% high charge, high energy (HZE) particles of Z > 2 and will comprise the majority of space radiation exposure for long- duration missions beyond the Van Allen belts [1]. The space radiation environment also consists of mixtures of high-energy protons and a minor fraction of other ions released from the sun during SPEs. During long-term deep space missions, it is anticipated that multiple SPEs will be encountered. We and others have been studying the effects of space radiation on the ocular tissue in animal models using beams of high-energy protons produced by particle accelerators [2,3,4,5]. Prolonged spaceflight induces physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities in astronauts, collectively defined as the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) [6]. However, the underlying mechanisms of the changes and factors contributing to the development of damage are unclear. Studies have shown that radiation at doses less than 1 Gy induced significant levels of retinal oxidative damage including retinal cell apoptosis [4]. More recent reports showed optical nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optical nerve disc including prelaminar region, lamina cribrosa, and retro-laminar region [7]. The mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of optic disc edema are less known and not well investigated. Recognizing the importance of the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight, we believe that understanding the impact of space radiation on the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) is crucial in assessing the risk to astronauts during long-duration missions, especially for future deep-space missions that will expose astronauts to greater radiation than previously encountered [8]. However, the effects of spaceflight relevant dose and dose rate exposures to protons in the mouse retina and in the ONH have not been previously addressed. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of whole-body proton exposure at a single dose of 0.5 Gy on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retinal and ONH region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated doses for a total dose of 0.5 Gy in 12 equal fractions over 25 days to simulate the chronic exposures in space. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Animals and Irradiation with High Energy Protons Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice, each weighing between 30–35 g, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and shipped to Loma Linda University (LLU) in Loma Linda, CA. The animals were maintained under a constant temperature of 68 °F with a 12-h day/night cycle. Chow and water were available ad libitum. After a one-week acclimation period, the mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at a single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractionations for the total dose of 0.5 Gy over 25 days. To simulate a space-like energy distribution of protons, we have used a spread-out Bragg peak set-up. To facilitate frequent use of medical treatment facilities, we selected energies and field modulations that are commonly used in cancer treatment at the J.M. Slater Proton Treatment Facility at Loma Linda University Medical Center, so that dosimetry, beam tuning, and other practical considerations would be relatively routine and reproducible. This facility uses a synchrotron built at Fermi National Laboratory upgraded and operated by Optivus Proton Therapy, Inc. as the Conforma 3000® Proton Beam Treatment System. The operating and dosimetry system is Odessey™ provided by PerMedics, Inc., of San Bernardino, California, USA. Dosimetry is provided by a series of parallel plate ion chambers calibrated to a NIST-traceable thimble ion chamber [9]. Therefore we used a beam of tuned energy 186 MeV and passed the beam through ~12 cm of plastic (“solid water”™) to reduce energy to 140 MeV and a spinning modulator wheel to produce a field of constant dose over a depth of 14 cm resulting in a field of protons with energies from 0 to 140 MeV in approximately equal abundance with high spatial uniformity. The range of LET values in the field is from 0.57 at the entrance to ~21 keV/µm at component Bragg Peaks and samples occupied the first 7.5 cm of the spread-out Bragg peak. Proton exposures were performed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings after patient treatments. The acute exposure was a single exposure to 0.5 Gy while for the fractionated exposures there were 12 fractions each of 4.17 cGy. The acute exposures were 38–43 s long at a dose rate of 0.74 Gy/min (clinical dose rate) while the fractions were 30–37 s long delivered at 1/10th the clinical dose rate at 0.075 Gy/min in 13–16 accelerator spills. Acute exposures were performed only during the 12th irradiation session. For each exposure, there were two 10 × 10 × 7.5 cm ventilated plastic restraint boxes each containing two freely-moving animals from the same cage. The boxes were aligned to a 20 cm circular field target placed on the patient treatment table where the beam passed vertically downward through the target avoiding self-shielding by the animals. Animals were loaded into restraint boxes in the animal care facility and transported by covered cart to the proton treatment area. Small battery-powered fans operated inside the cart to assure adequate air circulation. Total time in restraint boxes was approximately one hour. To assure equal restraint and handling stress across the three treatment groups, sham irradiated mice were subjected to the same restraint and transportation procedures during each of the 12 irradiation sessions. Similarly, acute irradiated animals were restrained and transported during each irradiation session but only exposed to protons during the last session. Total time in restraint boxes for all animals was approximately one hour on each of the twelve procedure days. Restraint stress precautions were driven by post irradiation behavioral testing needs. All procedures were approved by the Radiation Safety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LLU.2.2. Eye and Retina Preparation At four months after proton exposure and periodic behavioral testing, mice were euthanized and the right eye from each mouse was placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. 2.3. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Dutp Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay Sections were cut coronally through each left eye, and sections were roughly 100 μm apart providing five sections per eye for analysis. The ocular sections were evaluated using the TUNEL assay according to standard procedures. Briefly, six μm paraffin-embedded sections were processed using DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue, Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA). 2.4. Immunostaining for 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker on ocular sections was performed using 4-HNE antibody specific for lipid peroxidation. Six μm sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) at 4 °C for overnight followed by a rabbit anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody ( Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 1.5 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI.2.5. Immunohistochemistry for Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and Vascular Double-Labeling Six μm sections were incubated overnight (18–21 h) at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-AQP-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA) and monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clone GA5 (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) in 0.25% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed three times in PBS and further treated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 Goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.2.6. Immunostaining Assays for Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1) and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) Immunofluorescence staining related to BRB integrity on ocular sections was performed using biomarkers against PECAM-1 and ZO-1. Six µm sections were deparaffinized in Histoclear, rehydrated and, washed in PBS for 20 min. Vasculature was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies against ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) or CD31/PECAM-1 (Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) in antibody dilution buffer. After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 h with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (Life Technologies) followed by PBS washes. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. 2.7. Quantification of Immunostaining Six to ten field images were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ, USA) at 20× magnification spanning the entire retina per section. Data were obtained for 6 ocular samples of each group. For quantitative analysis, numbers of TUNEL positive cells were counted within the entire retina layer and in the ONH. The total number of TUNEL-positive nuclear/ganglion cells or endothelial cells in the retina or ONH were counted in five sections for each eye. The surface of each section was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ v1.49v software (available as freeware from National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/, access date: 1 June 2018) and the density profiles were expressed as a mean number of apoptotic cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. To determine AQP4, ZO-1, and PECAM immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on six to ten randomly selected fields on the retina or in the ONH of each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Fluorescence intensities for positive cells (red channel for ZO-1 and PECAM, and green channel for AQP-4) from the areas of interest were measured and data were extracted and averaged across five ocular sections per eye within the group as one experimental value.2.8. Statistical Analysis The results for the TUNEL assay and IHC were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test for multiple pair-wise comparisons (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). Means and standard error of means (SEM) are reported. α-level was set at 0.05 for all tests of statistical significance.3. Results 3.1. Apoptotic Damage in the Retina Quantitative assessment with TUNEL assay indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the irradiated groups by roughly 65% compared to that in the control group (Figure 1A). The number of TUNEL positive cells was also calculated in the ONH region (Figure 1B). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells was detected in the fractionated group by 50–67% compared to radiation with a single dose and sham controls, respectively (p < 0.05). Figure 1.

Oxidative Damage Biomarker Using 4-HNE Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker was performed using an antibody against 4-HNE specific for lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in immunoreactivity of HNE was seen in the retina (Figure 2A) of the mice that received a single dose compared to sham controls (p < 0.05). A strong trend increases (p = 0.06) in the fractionated dose group was also documented compared to controls (Figure 2B). In ONH (Figure 2C), the level of anti-HNE antibody protein in irradiated groups was significantly higher than controls. The immunoreactivity of HNE was more pronounced in the acute single dose group compared to the fractionated mouse group (Figure 2D). Figure 2.

Alteration of BRB Integrity Using Water Channel Protein AQP4, Adhesion Molecule PECAM-1, and Tight Junction Protein ZO-1 AQP4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet, which plays an important role in regulating of water permeability. No significant differences in protein expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker for astrocyte activation, was noted between groups. However, increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the irradiated groups compared with controls in the retina (Figure 3A). The difference in AQP-4 expression was greater in the irradiated retina of an acute single dose (p < 0.05) than that of fractionated one (p = 0.07) (Figure 3B). Low levels of AQP-4 expression were detected in the ONH region for all groups with no significant difference between groups (data not shown). Figure 3.

Protein expression of PECAM-1 and ZO-1 was evaluated in the retina and ONH region. In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells for PECAM-1 were found. In the irradiated retina from both single and fractionated dose groups, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and GCL (Figure 4A). Irradiated groups (single or fractionated doses) showed a significant increase of PECAM immunoreactivity compared to sham control in the retina (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B) and in the ONH region (Figure 4C). In the control retinal tissue, positive ZO-1 staining was apparent in the retinal INL and GCL. Only a few positive cells were found in the retina from irradiated mice (Figure 5A). Decreased ZO-1 expression was detected in the retina for both single and fractioned dose groups compared to controls (p < 0.05) (Figure 5B). However, positive staining for ZO-1 immunoreactivity, as observed in the retina of the control group, was not detected in the ONH region among all groups (data not shown). Figure 4.

Discussion This study demonstrated that 0.5 Gy of proton radiation induced significant changes in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and BRB integrity biomarkers in the mouse retina four months after a dose of 0.5 Gy. There were differential responses between single and fractionated dose schedules in several parameters. Differences related to BRB biomarker distribution were observed between the retina and ONH (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of Biomarker Expressions in The Retina and Optic Nerve Head (ONH).

Free radicals initiate a variety of cellular signaling and alter biomarkers that lead to cellular damage. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation [11]. Studies suggest that HNE plays an important role in stress-mediated signaling for cellular damage and in the mechanisms of apoptosis caused by these stress factors [12]. Our observations show increased 4-HNE staining indicative of oxidative damage to the retina and optic nerve after proton radiation exposure compared to controls. The findings were consistent with previous findings in many research models [11,13]. Radiation delivered in fractionation over 25 days showed a smaller level of HNE expression than that of a single dose in the retina and ONH. However, single- and fractionated-dose schedules appear to produce a similar level of apoptosis in the retina, while fractionated dose schedules showed a higher number of apoptotic cell damage in the ONH region. It is the general consensus that for radiotherapy, and for patients who receive high total doses, a hyperfractionated dose produces less damage to normal tissue by permitting dose recovery for damage repair to DNA and other proteins [14]. However, our retina apoptosis data did not indicate that there was substantial repair of injury or dose recovery at a late observation time point of four months, although the total doses that were delivered to the mouse were much lower than the dose delivered to the patients in the radiotherapy. Our previous study also showed that there were no significant differences in retinal endothelial cell density following single or split dose with two equal dose fractions of 8–28 Gy [15]. Evaluation of DNA repair of double-strand breaks in the rabbit retina, confirms that little DNA repair for dose recovery was found in the aged rabbit retinas [16,17], although retinal radiosensitivity of mice may be different compared to that of rats or rabbits. Surprisingly, a higher number of TUNEL positive cells were detected in the fractionated dose group compared to that of acute single dose exposure in the ONH region. One possible explanation is that acute radiation-induced apoptosis in the ONH may precede fractionated doses-induced apoptosis. By four months, the level of apoptotic damage already passes its peak in the retina that received single dose of 0.5 Gy, so it is less pronounced in acute irradiated group than that of fractionated dose group at four months. However, the complex regional difference in response to single and hyperfractionated dose schedule warrant further investigation. The difference in structure, cellular composition, and permeability or BRB property may contribute to the capacity of the tissue to regulate radiation response in the retina and ONH. In the present study, we found that low-dose proton radiation induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. AQP-4, a water channel protein, has an important role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet [18]. The upregulation of AQP-4 in irradiated retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential disruption of barrier integrity and even possible edema formation. PECAM-1 is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes that can be highly induced in response to inflammatory situations, leading to secretion of chemokines and cytokines [19]. PECAM-1 serves as an adhesion-signaling molecule with important roles in inflammation and leukocyte transmigration [20]. It functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to modulate endothelial cell junctional integrity [21] and may serve as a primary coordinator of many signaling pathways involved in cell metabolism and protein expression [22]. Increased expression of PECAM-1 has also been shown to lead to disruption of BRB integrity after retinal vascular injury [23]. Leukocyte migration from the blood into the retinal tissue promotes the breakdown of the BRB [24]. The higher PECAM-1 expression in the retina following radiation exposure observed in our study may facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to changes in the BRB permeability [25]. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on tight junctions (TJs). Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins and peripheral cytoplasmic proteins. ZO-1 is peripheral cytoplasmic protein and is critical in the initial formation, distinct organization, and function of TJs [26,27]. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 [28]. Our previous spaceflight study also showed decreased immunoreactivity of ZO-1 expression in the retina of the flight group compared to the ground controls [29]. Targeted irradiation of mice caused corneal endothelial cell loss, reduction of ZO-1 junctional contacts, and induction of corneal edema [30]. The degradation of TJ-associated proteins in the retina following injury has been also shown to lead to BRB breakdown [18]. In the current study, the decrease in ZO-1 protein expression in the retina together with the increase in water channel protein AQP-4 and adhesion molecules PECAM-1, in conjunction with increased apoptosis, suggests the BRB disturbance and prolonged tissue remodeling due to radiation exposure with single or fractionated dose schedules. More recently, ONH has become one of the focuses in the research surrounding SANS [7]. Edema was observed in the prelaminar ONH in astronauts [31]. These data points to the hypothesis that multiple factors, including fluid shifts, may lead to ONH swelling and associated intraocular alterations [32,33]. Previous human and monkey studies showed that prelaminar ONH has distinct BRB properties when compared to the retina. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ONH lack blood-brain barrier (BBB) proteins and display nonspecific permeability, while the retina has BBB characteristic proteins but lacks permeability biomarkers [34]. Some of our results are in agreement with their findings. In our mouse study, we found that radiation exposure induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. The staining pattern in the ONH differs from that of the retina. Low level positive staining for BRB biomarkers including water channel protein, AQP-4 and TJ protein, ZO-1 in ONH region indicates deficient BRB function, although adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 was present in the ONH. PECAM-1 also plays an important role in mediating trans-endothelial immune cell migration [35] and participates in key inflammatory events [25]. Lack of BRB biomarkers in the ONH may reflect dysregulation of barrier function and vessel integrity that can cause chronic inflammation, rendering more susceptible of this region to environmental insults and pathology of ONH diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate vascular permeability as well as lymphatic and glymphatic clearance related to the accumulation of fluid in the ONH region [36]. In conclusion, we hope that our investigation sheds light on the mechanism of space radiation-induced ocular response. Knowledge gained from this study could aid further approaches toward more effective countermeasures during human space travel. Our long-term goal is to use system biology approach to investigate the association between ophthalmic changes and other organs pathologies in response to ionizing radiation and to facilitate a better understanding of space radiation-induced tissues response and its relationship to health implication that may lead to disease development.

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function. Subject terms: Neuroscience, Chronic inflammation",
    "introduction": "Introduction The spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts1,2 caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success3. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts3. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified4–8. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging9–12. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells13 and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB)14. Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function15. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion16. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion17. Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis18. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption19, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids20 and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses21. Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage22–26. Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling27–30. However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene expression using a neuroinflammatory assay panel to investigate inflammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue after spaceflight.",

Changes of gene expression associated with neuronal function Genes directly involved with neuronal function were universally downregulated and are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 1. Overall, a picture of decreased neuron plasticity and signaling dysfunction is painted. Those genes that are involved in neuron support cell function were also found to be broadly downregulated and are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inflammation related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two upregulated genes, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238). The summary is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3. Generally, we see the impairment of genes related to microbial defense with generalized dysfunction of immunity and disinhibition of inappropriate inflammation. And finally, genes with roles in cellular stress and growth are shown in Fig. 4 with downregulation in all genes with exception of HSPB1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_013560), GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817), CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635), SESN1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370), and CDC25A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658) which were significantly upregulated. In general, we see an increased cellular stress response, growth arrest, and a possible trend toward more inflammatory-associated cell death. Table 2.

Spaceflight-induced changes of pathways Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were altered by flight condition using DEG identified by Nanostring’s Advanced Analysis module pathway scoring through correlation-guided gene subsetting, which functionally annotated groups of genes followed by unsupervised clustering of samples31. Higher scores compared to normalized gene expression general means upregulation while lower scores represent downregulation. Figure 5 summarized pathway results in a plot of all pathway scores compared to GC controls. Among these pathways, scores for angiogenesis, cytokine signaling, epigenetic regulation, and notch signaling were significantly increased which may indicate upregulation of the pathway (p < 0.05), while scores for innate immune response and oligodendrocyte function were greatly reduced in the flight group compared to the controls which may indicate downregulation of the pathways (p < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (Fig. 6a–f).

    "discussion": "Discussion Our data showed robust changes in gene expression profiles after spaceflight. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated. Decreased expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Downregulation of microglial gene expression that is important for apoptotic cell clearance, phagocytosis, and proliferation were evident. Genes supporting innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of these observed changes are in line with our previous findings in the brains exposed to simulated spaceflight condition. Following combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are significantly altered29. Gene expression in the brain that was analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were downregulated32. However, in contrary to our findings, many genes related to stress, immune response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory response were significantly upregulated in their study. Duration of environmental stress may play a role in different response of gene expression profiles and pathway regulation. We saw uniform downregulation of gene expression in our mouse brain samples directly related to neuron function. NRGN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029) coding for a postsynaptic kinase called neurogranin was found to be significantly reduced in expression. When neurogranin binds calmodulin, the concentration of calcium needed to transduce a signal is increased33. Given the downregulation of NRGN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029) and possible decrease in availability of neurogranin, neurons may become more sensitive to firing. KCND1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423) codes for a potassium voltage-gated channel involved in neurotransmitter release which has been shown to be inhibited by some types of ROS generating treatments34–36. Environmental stressor-induced ROS may be provoking the down regulation of KCND1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423). DLG4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001109752) is transcribed into a protein associated with glutamatergic receptor signaling while also potentially participating in dendritogenesis37. Its downregulation observed in our assay has the potential to affect glutamatergic neuron signaling, and affect dendritic morphology leading to further dysfunction. NLGN2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_198862) codes for a molecule which selectively mediates inhibitory synapses38. Its downregulation may contribute to dysfunction at inhibitory neuron synapses. Previous study has shown that inflammation induced loss of inhibitory nerve terminals or a redistribution of presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons may increase risk for developing neurological disease and psychiatric illness, including seizures and schizophrenia39. Regarding genes involved in neuron function and plasticity, we continue to see universal downregulation in the flight tissue compared to GC controls. The gene SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) behaves as a transcriptional repressor involved in cortical neuron differentiation40. In past studies the silencing of this gene in mice has shown decreased memory consolidation41. It is possible that downregulation may have similar, albeit reduced effects on mice in spaceflight. RELN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011261) codes for an extracellular matrix serine protease that regulates microtubule function and plays a role in the layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex, among other structures42. Its enzymatic activity that is important for cell adhesion and reduced transcription, as seen in our flight mice, could lead to further reduction of nervous system plasticity. SLC2A5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_019741) in a gene responsible for the GLUT5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2700445) fructose transporter that has been found in numerous areas including the BBB, and the hippocampus43,44. The downregulation of this gene suggests the decreased ability of cells to utilize fructose as a potential energy source. Level of gene expression related to neuron support cells, like microglial cells and oligodendrocytes were also seen universally downregulated. Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the innate immune system in the brain and play an important role in cytokine production45. Their activation is closely associated with environmental stress and microglial dysfunction is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases46. CSF1R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001037859) is a gene coding for a cell-surface receptor which binds to colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529) and interleukin-34 (IL-34) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001135100)47. CSF1R null mice have been shown to have fewer phagocytic cells and reduced survival48. Given these findings we suggest that flight mice may have a reduced capacity to generate microglial cells in the nervous system. MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587) creates a kinase protein in innate immune cells which mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells and acts as a negative regulator of inflammation49–51. Downregulation of this gene may contribute to immune dysregulation in our flight mice. TREM2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_031254) codes for a regulator of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis of apoptotic52,53. In previous in vivo studies with microglial lacking TREM2, decreased migration to areas of apoptotic neurons was shown54. NCF1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001286037) codes for a key subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system55,56. Downregulation suggests a reduced capacity for microglial cells to generate an effective microbial defense. SLC2A5 codes for the GLUT5 fructose transporter, as described previously43. With reduced activity, microglial cells may have less capacity to utilize fructose as an energy source and may be more prone to suffer from metabolic related dysfunction. Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. It plays critical roles in axonal metabolic support, myelination, and providing nutritional support to neurons57,58. A couple of key genes involved in the oligodendrocyte function have been significantly downregulated in the flight mice. PLP1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011123) codes for a major myelin protein that plays an important role in its formation and maintenance59. The implication of significantly downregulated PLP1 indicates impaired neuron axonal function with the possibility of long-term neurodegeneration. OPALIN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_153520) plays a role in oligodendrocyte cytoskeletal remolding and morphology. Downregulation of this gene observed in our study may be an indication of decreased activity of oligodendrocytes. These findings are further reinforced by a significantly decreased oligodendrocyte function pathway score (Fig. 6a). In terms of gene expression that associated with general immune functions and inflammation, only two genes were found to be significantly upregulated in our flight mice population, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238). H2-T23 expression is essential for immunological protection and regulation60. HT-T23 dependent T-cell inhibitory interactions aid in preventing expansion of autoreactive CD4 T-cells and collateral autoimmune diseases61. Upregulation of this gene may be a protective response to generalized inflammation in the flight mice. SOX4 directly regulates Innate-like γδ T-cell (Tγδ17), a major source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010552). Increased SOX4 expression may lead to an increase of this cytokine expression in the flight mice62. The gene RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068) has been shown to be a promotor of survival, apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways63,64. However, mice deficient in RIPK1 demonstrated loss of inhibition of a necroptosis pathway which promoted the release of necroptotic damage-associated molecular patterns65. Downregulation of RIPK1 observed in our study may lead to a similar reduction of appropriate apoptosis and an increase in necroptosis resulting in undesirable inflammation. Overall, taking these findings in conjunction with a significantly increased cytokine signaling pathway score (Fig. 6b), inflammatory signaling appears to be significantly dysregulated in our spaceflight mice. Immune dysfunction is further illustrated via the downregulation of two genes important for antimicrobial defense. MPEG1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010821) is a pore-forming bactericidal molecule of the innate immune system. It has been shown to be required for the activity of ROS and nitric oxide and their antibacterial effects66,67. OPTN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_181848) codes for a protein that plays a key role in bacterial autophagic clearance. Deficient mice have also been shown to have impaired interferon regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001159393) signaling and reduced response to toll-like receptor stimulation68. In summary, these results imply the impaired antibacterial capabilities and increased viral susceptibility in the flight mouse brain compared to GC group. Our data indicate that the regulation of innate immune response was impaired following spaceflight. The pathway score for the innate immune response was significantly reduced in the flight group compared to GCs (Fig. 6c). The cell type score for exhausted CD8 cells is also greatly reduced for the flight group compared to controls and may indicate a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8 T-cell response. T-cell exhaustion represents an adaptive response to conditions of chronic antigen stimulation and inflammation69, as well as promoting tissue repair following an inflammatory injury70. Functionally exhausted CD8+ cells may result in a severely compromised innate immune response71. Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_024264) plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol and cholesterol-related compounds72. In humans, complete CYP27A1 deficiency leads to nodule formation in the brain which may lead to dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spinal cord paresis73. This altered cholesterol metabolism closely associates with inflammatory responses involved in the pathogenesis of AD progression74. In deficient mice, a significant increase in cholestanol in the brain is observed75. Downregulation of CYP27A1, as seen in our flight mice, may lead to neurodegeneration and inflammation in more chronic settings or to a milder degree. Fourteen genes that were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to GCs were found to have direct roles in cellular growth, proliferation, and stress response. Two upregulated genes play an important part in cell cycle arrest during times of cellular stress. GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817) has been found to play a role in activating checkpoints in the cell cycle following exposure of cells to irradiation76. CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635) contributes to cell cycle arrest during DNA damage and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli, including hypoxia77. Additionally, expression of CCNG2 is found to be significantly increased in cell cycle-arrested and terminally differentiated cells78. Upregulation of these genes may be due to exposure to irradiation, among other stressors, during spaceflight. The downregulation of genes involved in promoting transcription and cell cycle progression was also seen. BRD2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010238) codes for a nuclear kinase involved in regulating the expression of cell cycle genes via binding to multiple E2Fs, a family of transcription factors79. E2F1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007891) regulates activation of DNA replication and G1/S transition when interacting with BRD280. BRD2 also interacts with BRD3, a chromatin reader with roles in regulating transcription81. BRD3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113573) further regulates transcription by promoting the binding of the transcription factors to their targets82. SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) codes for a transcription factor which regulates cell cycle progression by repressing gene expression for cell cycle inhibitor40. It has been linked to functional cellular changes in proliferation, cell cycle, and stem cell function in mice models83. Downregulation of these genes involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation may further amplify the upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle arrest. These changes are similarly reinforced by a significantly increased epigenetic regulation pathway score (Fig. 6e) indicating that there may be an increased level of modulating and checks being implemented during transcription, due to spaceflight. A recent study has shown that cell cycle regulation is closely linked to hippocampal neurogenesis which plays critical roles in memory and learning84. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that involves proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, or survival and maturation of newborn neurons84. Environmental stressors have been shown to modulate cell cycle progression, particular in the G1 phase85. These observed changes of gene expression related to the cell cycle in our study may indicate altered regulation of neurogenesis. Many downregulated genes were known to be involved in cellular stress responses. MAP2K4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009157) is a kinase involved with responses to cellular stress including apoptosis, inflammation, cellular proliferation, and neurodegeneration. A deficiency of MAP2K4 has been shown to result in cellular susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition86. However, it has been demonstrated that disruption of both MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001042557) genes was required to thoroughly block cellular growth caused by environmental stressors87. MRE11A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_018736), a part of an exonuclease complex central to the cellular DNA damage response was downregulated. The MRE11 complex is essential to vertebrates and defects lead to sensitivity to DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoints deficiency88. Its downregulation may point to a certain level of dysfunction leading to an impaired response to cellular stress leaving the flight mice more vulnerable to DNA damage. Different brain regions have different vulnerability to environmental stressors due to structural and biological heterogeneity of the regions, cell types and molecular networks89. Regional differences of protein biomarkers in response to stressors were observed in a previous flight study41. Given this finding, gene expression profiles in specific regions of the brain in response to spaceflight will be investigated in future studies. More recently, single-cell sequencing technologies, including transcriptomics, are available by directly measuring multiple molecular signatures in specific brain cells, providing robust molecular identity of specific cell types90. Brain tissues were dissected and prepared for analysis within 60 h after landing. It is possible that observed changes in gene expression profiles in neuroinflammation are a compensatory acute response to the acceleration and intense noise of launch or reflect changes to the combined response of spaceflight environment and the landing. In order to evaluate the immune response to spaceflight environment, in the further study, mice will be euthanized in the orbit and brain tissues will be immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Furthermore, in order to test the hypothesis that neuroinflammation plays an important role in developing spaceflight-induced stress response in the brain, an anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory compound will be injected to mouse before or during the flight to determine the protective effect against oxidative damage in the brain. It is noted from our study that among those genes which expression were significantly altered by spaceflight, markedly more gene expressions are being downregulated than upregulated. It is speculated that many genes may be upregulated during spaceflight and the early phase after landing as an adaptation response. During re-adaptation, the expression of these previous upregulated genes could be then downregulated as a compensatory response, or when protein synthesis from upregulated genes has been completed, these genes expression may be downregulated32. Collectively, changes noted in our study indicate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in gene expression and signaling pathways related to neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function. Study showed that chronically dysfunctional and deregulated pathways, including cytokine signaling (Fig. 6b), epigenetic regulation (Fig. 6e), and notch signaling (Fig. 6f) play important roles in disease development91, and have been associated with several progressive neurodegenerative diseases92. Our observed changes of a dysregulated inflammatory response, downregulated T-cell response, and reduced microglia signaling (Fig. 6g) might also have an impact on brain structure and function, and further lead to chronic neuroinflammation. It has been shown that here are strong correlations between neuroinflammatory biomarkers, brain morphology and behavioral outcomes93. It may be hypothesized that chronical changes of observed gene expression profiles could have long-term effects on brain morphology and organism behavior.",

Copyright notice ID: 9365836 PMID: 35948598 Abstract It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function. Subject terms: Neuroscience, Chronic inflammationIntroduction The spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts1,2 caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success3. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts3. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified4–8. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging9–12. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells13 and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB)14. Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function15. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion16. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion17. Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis18. The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption19, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids20 and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses21. Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage22–26. Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling27–30. However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene expression using a neuroinflammatory assay panel to investigate inflammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue after spaceflight.Results Changes of gene expression in neuroinflammation panel A set of 54 differently expressed genes (DEG) significantly (p < 0.05) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test segregates the ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group (Table 1). Clusters of genes related to neuronal function, neuronal cell support, immune function, and cellular growth and stress were significantly altered and organized based on their protein’s role. SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350), SLC2A5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_019741), MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587), TREM2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_025864), RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068) are listed in multiple tables as they are found to play various roles.

Overall, a picture of decreased neuron plasticity and signaling dysfunction is painted. Those genes that are involved in neuron support cell function were also found to be broadly downregulated and are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 2. Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inflammation related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two upregulated genes, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238). The summary is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3. Generally, we see the impairment of genes related to microbial defense with generalized dysfunction of immunity and disinhibition of inappropriate inflammation. And finally, genes with roles in cellular stress and growth are shown in Fig. 4 with downregulation in all genes with exception of HSPB1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_013560), GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817), CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635), SESN1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370), and CDC25A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658) which were significantly upregulated. In general, we see an increased cellular stress response, growth arrest, and a possible trend toward more inflammatory-associated cell death. Table 2.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Spaceflight-induced changes of pathways Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were altered by flight condition using DEG identified by Nanostring’s Advanced Analysis module pathway scoring through correlation-guided gene subsetting, which functionally annotated groups of genes followed by unsupervised clustering of samples31. Higher scores compared to normalized gene expression general means upregulation while lower scores represent downregulation. Figure 5 summarized pathway results in a plot of all pathway scores compared to GC controls. Among these pathways, scores for angiogenesis, cytokine signaling, epigenetic regulation, and notch signaling were significantly increased which may indicate upregulation of the pathway (p < 0.05), while scores for innate immune response and oligodendrocyte function were greatly reduced in the flight group compared to the controls which may indicate downregulation of the pathways (p < 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (Fig. 6a–f). The score for microglia function was also decreased but with trending significance (p = 0.07) (Fig. 6g). Fig. 5. Spaceflight-induced changes of pathway scores.

Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated. Decreased expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Downregulation of microglial gene expression that is important for apoptotic cell clearance, phagocytosis, and proliferation were evident. Genes supporting innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of these observed changes are in line with our previous findings in the brains exposed to simulated spaceflight condition. Following combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are significantly altered29. Gene expression in the brain that was analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were downregulated32. However, in contrary to our findings, many genes related to stress, immune response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory response were significantly upregulated in their study. Duration of environmental stress may play a role in different response of gene expression profiles and pathway regulation. We saw uniform downregulation of gene expression in our mouse brain samples directly related to neuron function. NRGN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029) coding for a postsynaptic kinase called neurogranin was found to be significantly reduced in expression. When neurogranin binds calmodulin, the concentration of calcium needed to transduce a signal is increased33. Given the downregulation of NRGN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029) and possible decrease in availability of neurogranin, neurons may become more sensitive to firing. KCND1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423) codes for a potassium voltage-gated channel involved in neurotransmitter release which has been shown to be inhibited by some types of ROS generating treatments34–36. Environmental stressor-induced ROS may be provoking the down regulation of KCND1(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423). DLG4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001109752) is transcribed into a protein associated with glutamatergic receptor signaling while also potentially participating in dendritogenesis37. Its downregulation observed in our assay has the potential to affect glutamatergic neuron signaling, and affect dendritic morphology leading to further dysfunction. NLGN2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_198862) codes for a molecule which selectively mediates inhibitory synapses38. Its downregulation may contribute to dysfunction at inhibitory neuron synapses. Previous study has shown that inflammation induced loss of inhibitory nerve terminals or a redistribution of presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons may increase risk for developing neurological disease and psychiatric illness, including seizures and schizophrenia39. Regarding genes involved in neuron function and plasticity, we continue to see universal downregulation in the flight tissue compared to GC controls. The gene SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) behaves as a transcriptional repressor involved in cortical neuron differentiation40. In past studies the silencing of this gene in mice has shown decreased memory consolidation41. It is possible that downregulation may have similar, albeit reduced effects on mice in spaceflight. RELN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011261) codes for an extracellular matrix serine protease that regulates microtubule function and plays a role in the layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex, among other structures42. Its enzymatic activity that is important for cell adhesion and reduced transcription, as seen in our flight mice, could lead to further reduction of nervous system plasticity. SLC2A5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_019741) in a gene responsible for the GLUT5 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2700445) fructose transporter that has been found in numerous areas including the BBB, and the hippocampus43,44. The downregulation of this gene suggests the decreased ability of cells to utilize fructose as a potential energy source. Level of gene expression related to neuron support cells, like microglial cells and oligodendrocytes were also seen universally downregulated. Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the innate immune system in the brain and play an important role in cytokine production45. Their activation is closely associated with environmental stress and microglial dysfunction is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases46. CSF1R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001037859) is a gene coding for a cell-surface receptor which binds to colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529) and interleukin-34 (IL-34) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001135100)47. CSF1R null mice have been shown to have fewer phagocytic cells and reduced survival48. Given these findings we suggest that flight mice may have a reduced capacity to generate microglial cells in the nervous system. MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587) creates a kinase protein in innate immune cells which mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells and acts as a negative regulator of inflammation49–51. Downregulation of this gene may contribute to immune dysregulation in our flight mice. TREM2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_031254) codes for a regulator of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis of apoptotic52,53. In previous in vivo studies with microglial lacking TREM2, decreased migration to areas of apoptotic neurons was shown54. NCF1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001286037) codes for a key subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system55,56. Downregulation suggests a reduced capacity for microglial cells to generate an effective microbial defense. SLC2A5 codes for the GLUT5 fructose transporter, as described previously43. With reduced activity, microglial cells may have less capacity to utilize fructose as an energy source and may be more prone to suffer from metabolic related dysfunction. Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. It plays critical roles in axonal metabolic support, myelination, and providing nutritional support to neurons57,58. A couple of key genes involved in the oligodendrocyte function have been significantly downregulated in the flight mice. PLP1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011123) codes for a major myelin protein that plays an important role in its formation and maintenance59. The implication of significantly downregulated PLP1 indicates impaired neuron axonal function with the possibility of long-term neurodegeneration. OPALIN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_153520) plays a role in oligodendrocyte cytoskeletal remolding and morphology. Downregulation of this gene observed in our study may be an indication of decreased activity of oligodendrocytes. These findings are further reinforced by a significantly decreased oligodendrocyte function pathway score (Fig. 6a). In terms of gene expression that associated with general immune functions and inflammation, only two genes were found to be significantly upregulated in our flight mice population, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238). H2-T23 expression is essential for immunological protection and regulation60. HT-T23 dependent T-cell inhibitory interactions aid in preventing expansion of autoreactive CD4 T-cells and collateral autoimmune diseases61. Upregulation of this gene may be a protective response to generalized inflammation in the flight mice. SOX4 directly regulates Innate-like γδ T-cell (Tγδ17), a major source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010552). Increased SOX4 expression may lead to an increase of this cytokine expression in the flight mice62. The gene RIPK1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068) has been shown to be a promotor of survival, apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways63,64. However, mice deficient in RIPK1 demonstrated loss of inhibition of a necroptosis pathway which promoted the release of necroptotic damage-associated molecular patterns65. Downregulation of RIPK1 observed in our study may lead to a similar reduction of appropriate apoptosis and an increase in necroptosis resulting in undesirable inflammation. Overall, taking these findings in conjunction with a significantly increased cytokine signaling pathway score (Fig. 6b), inflammatory signaling appears to be significantly dysregulated in our spaceflight mice. Immune dysfunction is further illustrated via the downregulation of two genes important for antimicrobial defense. MPEG1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010821) is a pore-forming bactericidal molecule of the innate immune system. It has been shown to be required for the activity of ROS and nitric oxide and their antibacterial effects66,67. OPTN (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_181848) codes for a protein that plays a key role in bacterial autophagic clearance. Deficient mice have also been shown to have impaired interferon regulatory factors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001159393) signaling and reduced response to toll-like receptor stimulation68. In summary, these results imply the impaired antibacterial capabilities and increased viral susceptibility in the flight mouse brain compared to GC group. Our data indicate that the regulation of innate immune response was impaired following spaceflight. The pathway score for the innate immune response was significantly reduced in the flight group compared to GCs (Fig. 6c). The cell type score for exhausted CD8 cells is also greatly reduced for the flight group compared to controls and may indicate a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8 T-cell response. T-cell exhaustion represents an adaptive response to conditions of chronic antigen stimulation and inflammation69, as well as promoting tissue repair following an inflammatory injury70. Functionally exhausted CD8+ cells may result in a severely compromised innate immune response71. Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_024264) plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol and cholesterol-related compounds72. In humans, complete CYP27A1 deficiency leads to nodule formation in the brain which may lead to dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spinal cord paresis73. This altered cholesterol metabolism closely associates with inflammatory responses involved in the pathogenesis of AD progression74. In deficient mice, a significant increase in cholestanol in the brain is observed75. Downregulation of CYP27A1, as seen in our flight mice, may lead to neurodegeneration and inflammation in more chronic settings or to a milder degree. Fourteen genes that were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to GCs were found to have direct roles in cellular growth, proliferation, and stress response. Two upregulated genes play an important part in cell cycle arrest during times of cellular stress. GADD45G (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817) has been found to play a role in activating checkpoints in the cell cycle following exposure of cells to irradiation76. CCNG2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635) contributes to cell cycle arrest during DNA damage and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli, including hypoxia77. Additionally, expression of CCNG2 is found to be significantly increased in cell cycle-arrested and terminally differentiated cells78. Upregulation of these genes may be due to exposure to irradiation, among other stressors, during spaceflight. The downregulation of genes involved in promoting transcription and cell cycle progression was also seen. BRD2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010238) codes for a nuclear kinase involved in regulating the expression of cell cycle genes via binding to multiple E2Fs, a family of transcription factors79. E2F1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007891) regulates activation of DNA replication and G1/S transition when interacting with BRD280. BRD2 also interacts with BRD3, a chromatin reader with roles in regulating transcription81. BRD3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113573) further regulates transcription by promoting the binding of the transcription factors to their targets82. SIN3A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350) codes for a transcription factor which regulates cell cycle progression by repressing gene expression for cell cycle inhibitor40. It has been linked to functional cellular changes in proliferation, cell cycle, and stem cell function in mice models83. Downregulation of these genes involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation may further amplify the upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle arrest. These changes are similarly reinforced by a significantly increased epigenetic regulation pathway score (Fig. 6e) indicating that there may be an increased level of modulating and checks being implemented during transcription, due to spaceflight. A recent study has shown that cell cycle regulation is closely linked to hippocampal neurogenesis which plays critical roles in memory and learning84. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that involves proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, or survival and maturation of newborn neurons84. Environmental stressors have been shown to modulate cell cycle progression, particular in the G1 phase85. These observed changes of gene expression related to the cell cycle in our study may indicate altered regulation of neurogenesis. Many downregulated genes were known to be involved in cellular stress responses. MAP2K4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009157) is a kinase involved with responses to cellular stress including apoptosis, inflammation, cellular proliferation, and neurodegeneration. A deficiency of MAP2K4 has been shown to result in cellular susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition86. However, it has been demonstrated that disruption of both MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001042557) genes was required to thoroughly block cellular growth caused by environmental stressors87. MRE11A (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_018736), a part of an exonuclease complex central to the cellular DNA damage response was downregulated. The MRE11 complex is essential to vertebrates and defects lead to sensitivity to DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoints deficiency88. Its downregulation may point to a certain level of dysfunction leading to an impaired response to cellular stress leaving the flight mice more vulnerable to DNA damage. Different brain regions have different vulnerability to environmental stressors due to structural and biological heterogeneity of the regions, cell types and molecular networks89. Regional differences of protein biomarkers in response to stressors were observed in a previous flight study41. Given this finding, gene expression profiles in specific regions of the brain in response to spaceflight will be investigated in future studies. More recently, single-cell sequencing technologies, including transcriptomics, are available by directly measuring multiple molecular signatures in specific brain cells, providing robust molecular identity of specific cell types90. Brain tissues were dissected and prepared for analysis within 60 h after landing. It is possible that observed changes in gene expression profiles in neuroinflammation are a compensatory acute response to the acceleration and intense noise of launch or reflect changes to the combined response of spaceflight environment and the landing. In order to evaluate the immune response to spaceflight environment, in the further study, mice will be euthanized in the orbit and brain tissues will be immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Furthermore, in order to test the hypothesis that neuroinflammation plays an important role in developing spaceflight-induced stress response in the brain, an anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory compound will be injected to mouse before or during the flight to determine the protective effect against oxidative damage in the brain. It is noted from our study that among those genes which expression were significantly altered by spaceflight, markedly more gene expressions are being downregulated than upregulated. It is speculated that many genes may be upregulated during spaceflight and the early phase after landing as an adaptation response. During re-adaptation, the expression of these previous upregulated genes could be then downregulated as a compensatory response, or when protein synthesis from upregulated genes has been completed, these genes expression may be downregulated32. Collectively, changes noted in our study indicate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in gene expression and signaling pathways related to neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function. Study showed that chronically dysfunctional and deregulated pathways, including cytokine signaling (Fig. 6b), epigenetic regulation (Fig. 6e), and notch signaling (Fig. 6f) play important roles in disease development91, and have been associated with several progressive neurodegenerative diseases92. Our observed changes of a dysregulated inflammatory response, downregulated T-cell response, and reduced microglia signaling (Fig. 6g) might also have an impact on brain structure and function, and further lead to chronic neuroinflammation. It has been shown that here are strong correlations between neuroinflammatory biomarkers, brain morphology and behavioral outcomes93. It may be hypothesized that chronical changes of observed gene expression profiles could have long-term effects on brain morphology and organism behavior.Materials and methods Flight and ground control conditions Ten-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Bar Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission and lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats aboard the International Space Station. All FLT mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. Habitat GC mice were kept under similar housing conditions, including temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels using 48-h delayed telemetry data from the FLT group. Water and food bar diet specifically designed by NASA were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received the same access to food and water. NASA-Ames Research Center and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved this flight study. The study has been done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health.Mouse brain dissection after spaceflight Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, the FLT mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2. The GC mice were euthanized with the same method after 38 days of GC housing. Shortly after euthanasia, brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse (n = 5–6 per group) was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use.RNA isolation and gene expression profiling Isolation of total RNA from the brain tissues was performed using DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, # 80224) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, tissue homogenization was performed using 1.5 mm beads (Benchmark, # 1032-15) on Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) in RLT Plus buffer. The purity and concentration of the eluted RNA were measured using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. RNA samples (20 ng/ul) were then shipped to Nanostring (Technologies Seattle, WA) and gene expression profiling of brain tissues was conducted using the nCounter® neuroflammation pathways panel. The panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions and 13 potential housekeeping genes for normalization. RNA samples (100 ng each) on 2 cartridges were used for the Gene Expression Assay with Mouse Neuroinflammation panel performed on the nCounter MAX system (https://nanostring.com/wp-content/uploads/MAN-C0035_nCounter_Analysis_System_MAX_FLEX.pdf), a multi-channel epifluorescence scanner with Nanostring Advanced Analysis Module plugin for QC, normalization, and differential expression analysis (DE). Data files generated from nCounter system were analyzed using nSolver 4.0 software with the Advanced Analysis module for QC (quality control), normalization, DE analysis, and gene-set enrichment analysis. Data normalization included 2 steps: Positive control normalization to correct platform-associated variation and Codeset content normalization using the housekeeping (HK) genes to correct variability of input samples. Geometric means of selected HK probes were used to normalize counts of the samples and DEGs were generated from the normalized counts.Statistical analysis Gene expression profiling data were analyzed using nSolver analysis and the advanced analysis module software. Advanced analysis module software uses open-source R program for pathway scoring and gene-set enrichment analysis. Using the Reactome pathway database annotations, pathway scores are derived by calculating the first principle component of pathway genes’ normalized expression86 and data are summarized from changes of a gene set within a given pathway into a single score. To further analyze the associated pathways of the DEGs, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis was performed using biological process database to identify the annotated sets of genes based on the biological processes in which they participate. Significantly differential expression genes were presented in the tables with individual genes using log10 (p value) andlog2 fold change compared to the GC group. Pathview module was used to display upregulated genes or downregulated genes overlaid on KEGG pathways. For DEG and pathway analysis, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant between FLT and GC groups by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Dataset (217.2KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (1.2MB, pdf) Acknowledgements This study was supported by NASA Space Biology grant # NNX15AB41G and the LLU Department of Basic Sciences.
