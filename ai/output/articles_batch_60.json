    "abstract": "Abstract Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Space flight exposes astronauts to a variety of stressors [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] ranging from psychological to physical that stem from the environment they experience [9]. These environmental factors include gravity changes, radiation exposure, altered nutrition or altered circadian rhythms, all of which affect the immune response [10,11,12,13,14]. Dysregulation of the immune response has two-fold consequences for astronauts. First, it has the potential to jeopardize the mission while in space, and it causes long-term detrimental consequences [8,15,16], not just while they are in space, but also once they return to Earth [8,17,18,19]. Therefore, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of how the immune response is altered by space flight. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes comprising a sensor molecule such as NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and the cysteine aspartase caspase-1 [20]. The inflammasome plays a significant role in the regulation of the inflammatory response [21,22,23,24,25] by modulating the innate immune response through the activation of caspase-1, the processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, as well as the programmed cell death mechanism of pyroptosis [26]. The inflammasome has been shown to contribute to a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis [27,28,29,30,31], Parkinson’s disease [32,33], Alzheimer’s disease [34,35], inflammaging [36,37] and metabolic syndrome [38,39]. Several of these diseases, with an inflammasome etiology, have also been suggested to be relevant in the context of space flight such as the development of dementia [40], altered aging and inflammation [41] or diabetes [42]. Hence, it is important to understand the effects of space flight on inflammasome signaling to develop therapies against specific targets of the immune response to protect and improve the performance of astronauts not only during a mission, but also their health on Earth [43,44]. It has been shown that space radiation affects hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks [45], spatial navigation and episodic memory formation [46,47], which is very important for the overall health of astronauts [43,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. In addition, it has been suggested that space radiation affects the cortex and causes altered cognitive flexibility and synaptic plasticity, which contribute to cognitive deficits [58]. A recent study used the anti-oxidant LGM2605 to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in an in vitro model of lung vascular networks that were exposed to γ-rays and mixed-field radiation sources to mimic some of the space flight conditions in vitro [59]. The study found that 3–4 keV/µm and 8–10 keV/µm linear energy transfer (LET) proton radiation elevated the levels of NLRP3, and that this increase can be targeted with anti-oxidant approaches [59]. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effect of space flight on the expression of inflammasome proteins and inflammatory cytokines in mice that were part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission (RR-1) on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft that spent 37 to 38 days at the International Space Station (ISS).",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods Animal procedures were approved by IACUC numbers NASA: NAS-13-002-Y1 and CASIS: CAS-13-001-Y1 for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center and the Kennedy Space Center in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. 2.1. Flight Animals This animal study was approved by the NASA Ames Research Center and The Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Brain tissue samples were obtained by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft [60]. During the flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28 °C in a 12 h light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Study timeline.RR-1 (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/RR-1, accessed on 9 March 2025) lasted 37 days, and according to the NASA Open Science Data Repository′s (OSDR) Environmental Data App, between 21 September and 23 September, these mice experienced temperature changes ranging from 18.3 °C to 26.69 °C. On 24 September, the temperature stabilized between 21 and 23 °C. Importantly, mice in the ISS (flight group) and in the ground control group experienced the same temperature conditions. Overall, the lowest temperature in the ISS during RR-1 was 18.50 °C and the highest temperature was 26.80 °C, with a mean temperature of 22.76 °C, whereas in the ground control group, the lowest temperature was 18.30 °C and the maximum was 27.10 °C (mean temperature 22.76 °C). Moreover, telemetry data indicated that mice in the flight group experienced initial higher CO2 levels at around 2621 ppm on 20 September, whereas mice in the ground group experienced much lower CO2 levels at approximately 476 ppm. By 27 September, both groups of mice experienced similar CO2 conditions through the rest of the flight, approximately between 1868 ppm and 4690 ppm. The minimum CO2 level in the ISS group was 1862 ppm and the maximum was 4667 ppm (mean 3197.27, median 3192 ppm), whereas in the ground group, the minimum was 438 ppm, the maximum was 4690 ppm and the mean was 2853.74. The median was 3188 ppm. Moreover, by October 25th, mice in the ISS experienced an accumulated radiation dose of 7.17 mGy/day. In the ISS group, the minimum galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) dose was 0.13 mGy/day, and the maximum was 0.14 mGy/day (mean 0.13 mGy/day). Furthermore, the radiation experienced as a result of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) ranged between 0.06 and 0.10 mGy/day (mean 0.07 mGy/day). Together, these accounted for a minimum total dose of 0.19 mGy/day, a maximum of 0.23 mGy/day and an average of 0.20 mGy/day. 2.2. Ground Control Animals Animals were kept in similar conditions to flight animals (ambient temperature of 26 to 28 °C in a 12 h light and dark cycle). Telemetry data (with a 4-day delay) from the flight group were used to keep the ground control animals under similar conditions (housed in RR-1 flight hardware within an environmental simulator under the same conditions as the ISS). Water and food conditions for this group were the same as for the flight animal group as described. 2.3. Vivarium and Baseline Animals Animals in the vivarium group were animals that were housed under standard vivarium conditions and remained alive for the duration of study. Animals in the baseline group consisted of mice that were euthanized at the time when the animals in the flight group were launched. 2.4. Brain Dissection Within 4 h of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols [61,62,63], and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification [64]. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of brain cortex, hippocampus and rest of the tissue from the brain areas are referred as “other than cortex and hippocampus”. 2.5. Immunoblotting Analysis of inflammasome signaling proteins in brain protein lysates by immunoblotting was carried out as described in [65]. Accordingly, brain lysates (25 μg) were run and resolved in 4–20% Criterion TGX Stain-Free precast gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) prior to transfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals Centennial, CO, USA), ASC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), and IL-1β (Cell Signaling, Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h followed by HRP-linked secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 45 min. β-actin (1:5000, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a standard and protein loading control. Membranes were imaged with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad) following enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis for relative protein quantification was carried out with UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.3 Software (Silk Scientific Corporation, Vineyard, UT, USA). 2.6. Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections as described in [66,67] using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD, Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10, after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 µL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibodies for 2 h followed by 3 more washing steps and the addition of the 2X Read Buffer (MSD, Rockville, MD, USA). After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL for each analyte using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein concentration per sample. 2.7. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were carried out with Prism 10.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics were first calculated. Data were tested for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk Test. Comparisons between the flight and ground groups were carried out by a one-tail t-test when data met normality and by the Mann–Whittney test when data were not normally distributed.",

Levels of Inflammasome Signaling Molecules Are Decreased in the Brain of Mice That Experienced Spaceflight It has been previously shown that space travel affects the immune response [11]. To test the effects of spaceflight on inflammasome activation in the brain, we carried out an immunoblot analysis of brain areas other than cortex and hippocampus from mice that were in the ISS for approximately 1 month (Figure 1). Our findings indicate that caspase-1 (95% CI = Ground [1.06–5.9], Flight [0.3–2.3]) (Figure 2A), ASC (Ground [1.3–7.6], Flight [0.6–3.5]) (Figure 2B) and IL-1β (Ground [1.8–5.4], Flight [0.8–2.7]) (Figure 2C) were significantly decreased in the mice that were in the ISS when compared to the ground control group. In addition, the expression levels for all the inflammasome proteins analyzed in these studies in the vivarium group and those in the baseline group were similar to the spaceflight group (Figure S1). Together, these findings indicate that the expression levels of inflammasome signaling proteins in the brain of mice are lower in the mice that were in the ISS (flight) than the mice in the ground control group.

Inflammasome Proteins Are Decreased in the Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice After Spaceflight We then aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome signaling proteins present in the cortex (Figure 3A) and hippocampus (Figure 3B). Accordingly, immunoblot analysis of cortical and hippocampal protein lysates suggested that similar to our previously described findings (Figure 2), there was a trend towards decreased inflammasome activation in the cortex (Figure 3A) and the hippocampus (Figure 3B) of mice after spaceflight when compared to the ground control group. In addition, the brains of mice in the baseline group also had significantly lower levels of inflammasome activation in the cortex and hippocampus, which were similar to the protein expression levels in the flight group. Moreover, animals in the vivarium group presented much higher inflammasome protein levels than under baseline and spaceflight conditions. These findings suggest that in the cortex and hippocampus, inflammasome activation is lower after spaceflight. Figure 3.

Data were normalized to β-actin as a protein loading control. N = 2 per group. 3.3. Levels of Tnf-α and Il12p70 Are Decreased in the Brain of Mice After Spaceflight Gene expression changes associated with inflammation have been described in the brains of mice who experienced spaceflight conditions and remained in the ISS for over 30 days [61]. To determine the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in the brain of mice in the ground control and spaceflight conditions, we carried out an ECLIA to measure the protein levels of TNF-α (Figure 4A), IL-2 (Figure 4B), IFN-γ (Figure 4C), IL-5 (Figure 4D), IL-6 (Figure 4E), IL-12p70 (Figure 4F) and IL-10 (Figure 4G) in brain areas other than the cortex and hippocampus. Accordingly, we found similar levels of these cytokines between the ground and flight groups (Figure 4). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower levels of TNF-α and IL-12p70 in the baseline group when compared to the other groups (Figure S2). Together, these trends suggest that these inflammatory cytokines were not altered in regions outside the cortex and hippocampus as a result of mission RR1. Figure 4.

Data were normalized to total protein. Data presented as box-plots with dots as all data points. N = 5 per group. 3.4. Inflammatory Cytokine Levels in the Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice After Spaceflight To preliminarily determine the inflammatory profile in the cortex (Figure S3) and hippocampus (Figure S4) of mice, we used ECLIA to measure the levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12p70 in protein lysates. However, due to the low sample size (N = 2), we were unable to carry out any statistical analyses in these tissues for the expression of these cytokines, yet the preliminary findings suggest that in the brain, the inflammatory response mediated by different cytokines is different in the cortex (Figure S3) than in the hippocampus (Figure S4) as a result of space flight.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Previous studies have shown that the adaptive immune response is compromised as a result of space flight missions, resulting in the reactivation of viruses [68]. In addition, a previous study has shown that following 13 days of spaceflight on board of space shuttle mission STS-118, mice experienced a decrease in liver, spleen and thymus mass compared to the ground control group, which was consistent with the decreased number of lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophage and granulocytes [69]. However, how space flight affects the inflammatory response mediated by the inflammasome in the brain of mice has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we determined the levels of the key inflammasome signaling proteins caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β in the brain of mice after a stay of 37 days on the ISS. In addition, we measured the levels of cytokines that contribute significantly to the inflammatory response in the brain such as TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12p70 [70,71,72]. We used immunoblotting and ECLIA approaches to determine the inflammatory protein profile in the brains of mice that were in the ISS as part of the RR-1 mission that was launched on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 on 21 September 2014 and returned to earth on October 25th of the same year. Consistent with results from the STS-118 study, here we demonstrate that conditions experienced during a mission to low Earth orbit result in a significant decrease in levels of inflammasome proteins in the brain. Previous studies from RR-1 have shown that these mice experienced increased expression of genes associated with non-shivering thermogenesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue as well as increased expression of genes associated with glucose metabolism and adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue [73], consistent with other studies that showed altered liver [74] and muscle metabolism in these mice, which suggested that these mice experienced muscle atrophy [75] and that dietary changes might have been needed as a countermeasure [76]. During the RR-1 mission, mice in the flight group presented higher levels of CO2 than the ground control group (2621 ppm vs. 476 ppm). However, approximately a week later, mice in both groups experienced similar CO2 conditions. Increased CO2 levels in neutrophils for a couple of hours have been shown to increase IL-1β as well as the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 without affecting the levels of ASC [77]. Thus, it is possible that the changes seen between the ground control group and the flight group are due to the fluctuations in the CO2 levels. Furthermore, another variable that needs to be taken into account is that there was a difference between the vivarium group and the ground control group, bringing up the possibility of an effect due to the habitat. Notably, the CO2 levels in the vivarium group were the same as ambient air (~419 ppm), which were much lower than the ground group (median: 3188 ppm). In addition, some differences have been described between the vivarium and the animal enclosure module in which water and food consumption were higher in the animal enclosure module without a significant effect on overall body mass but some differences in the weight of certain organs were reported; however, that study did not report the weight of the brain [78]. Alternatively, taken together, it is possible that the effects seen in the flight group are in part due to the effects of the CO2 levels in the brain and the stress associated with space flight. Therefore, part of the elevated levels seen in the ground control group compared to the vivarium group may be due in part to the habitat environment and the CO2 levels. Importantly, the CO2 levels between the ground and the flight groups eventually stabilized after 7 days (ISS median: 3192 ppm; ground median: 3188 ppm). During the RR-1, mice in the flight group experienced an average of 0.20 mGy/day. Previous studies have shown that whole body exposure to higher doses from a 137CsCl radiation source (0.5 to 4 Gy) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in inflammasome activation as determined by the cleavage of caspase-1 at 1 day after exposure, an effect that was not present at 1 and 4 h; moreover, caspase-1 cleavage was significantly decreased by day 14 in immune cells [79]. Following this radiation protocol, inflammasome activation was mainly identified in macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells [79]. In addition, UV radiation has been shown to also activate inflammasomes [80]. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure of mice to silicon (0.5 Gy) or iron (0.15 Gy) ions results in increased cytokine production that is associated with infiltration of immune cells [81,82]. A recent study in a model of the lung vascular network exposed to low levels of radiation ranging from 0.25 to 1 Gy [83] showed increased expression of the inflammasome sensor NLRP3, which was decreased by treatment with LGM2605, a scavenger of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and active chlorine species (ACS), which is capable of reducing ionizing species due to radiation [59]. Similarly, in a study using a clinostat to model microgravity (10−3 gravitational force) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the authors showed that microgravity also increased the expression of NLRP3 consistent with increased expression of IL-1β and increased stress in the endoplasmic reticulum [84]. Moreover, a recent study showed that 8 Gy of radiation can inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages exposed to ATP and LPS by a mechanism that involves inhibiting TWIK2 expression [85]. However, whether the 7.17 mGy/day of accumulated radiation is also capable of causing lower levels of inflammasome protein expression experienced by mice in the flight group is yet to be tested. In this study, we have shown that in the brain of mice who were in the ISS, there were lower levels of the inflammasome signaling proteins caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β when compared to the ground control group. Interestingly, the levels of these proteins were similar to those levels present in the brains of the animals corresponding to the baseline group, which were sacrificed at the time of launch, suggesting that the inflammasome proteins continued to increase over time in the ground control group; however, this increase in inflammasome protein expression was arrested or stalled in the ISS group. We have previously shown that inflammasome activation in the brain increases as part of the inflammaging response [36,37,67]. In contrast to those inflammaging studies, the brain data from the mice in RR1 presented lower levels of these inflammasome proteins similar to those levels that were present in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch. These data would suggest that the innate immune response mediated by the inflammasome is not weakened by space flight, but that it does not develop as it normally does on Earth. Consistent with these findings on decreased inflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS), animals in RR-1 have also been shown to present younger epigenetic age in the retina than the ground control group [86]. Similarly, in the NASA Twin Study, the spaceflight twin presented a longer telomere length than his twin brother who remained on Earth, suggesting that in space, the aging process is slowed down [41]. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that spaceflight decreases brain inflammaging mediated by the inflammasome. It is possible that the decrease in the levels of inflammasome signaling proteins after spaceflight may be the result of a protective attempt to dampen the innate immune response in the brain following the stress experienced in space in the ISS. Stalled replication forks have been previously shown to limit the innate immune response mediated by cGAS–STING following replication stress and in order to maintain genome stability [87]. Thus, it is possible that the stress of exposure associated with radiation and microgravity [88,89,90,91,92,93] in the ISS mice resulted in stalled replication forks responsible for regulating inflammasome expression in the brain, which ultimately is responsible for the levels of inflammasome activation in the brain similar to those seen in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch (baseline group). Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines tested presented a similar pattern of expression between the baseline and flight groups. Moreover, our findings on the cortex and hippocampus suggest a differential expression of different cytokines in different parts of the brain, even with a very limited sample size. As anticipated, these findings suggest diverse roles in the inflammatory response mounted by different cytokines in the brain. In general, we would have anticipated that the inflammasome would be increased in the ISS group when compared to the baseline group based on previous studies looking at the peripheral immune response as a result of space flight. However, in this study, we have measured the inflammatory response in the CNS, suggesting that the immune response mounted in the brain as a result of space flight differs between the CNS and the periphery, an effect that is perhaps due to the relatively immune-privileged status of the brain owing to the characteristics of the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, similar observations have been previously reported in which spaceflight conditions resulted in immune dysfunctions and dysregulated inflammation [94,95]. Future studies are needed to confirm these results in other missions. However, consistent with these results, a previous study in the brain of mice that were in the ISS for 35 days and were flown on board SpaceX-12 as part of RR9 showed downregulation of immune genes [61]. Furthermore, in this study, only female mice were used. Thus, future studies are needed to better understand the sex differences associated with space flight in the inflammatory response in the brain, considering that previous studies have shown that brain cells respond differently in males vs. females to space-related radiation conditions [96,97,98,99]. Another limitation of this study is the low sample size characteristic of this type of space biology studies. In addition, although the trends are similar across different brain areas, it is not clear what areas of the brain are included in those that did not include the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, since we have only analyzed samples from RR-1, we were not able to compare the results of RR-1 to other missions. Thus, we do not know if the results of this study could be generalized to space flight in general or if these findings are particular to events/conditions that took place during the RR-1 mission. Future, studies should aim at analyzing mouse brains from other missions with larger sample sizes, as well as studies with more accurately described dissected brain areas, and with considerations for sex differences. Furthermore, it would be important to compare these findings in the rodent brain to blood-based biomarkers obtained from astronauts in missions of different durations. In conclusion, this study offers for the first time information on the effects of spaceflight on the innate immune response mediated by the inflammasome in the mouse brain after inhabiting the ISS for approximately one month. Thus, it is important to expand on these findings in the future to develop effective countermeasures against the detrimental effects associated with space flight.",

Copyright notice ID: 11941215 PMID: 40136666 Abstract Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.

Introduction Space flight exposes astronauts to a variety of stressors [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] ranging from psychological to physical that stem from the environment they experience [9]. These environmental factors include gravity changes, radiation exposure, altered nutrition or altered circadian rhythms, all of which affect the immune response [10,11,12,13,14]. Dysregulation of the immune response has two-fold consequences for astronauts. First, it has the potential to jeopardize the mission while in space, and it causes long-term detrimental consequences [8,15,16], not just while they are in space, but also once they return to Earth [8,17,18,19]. Therefore, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of how the immune response is altered by space flight. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes comprising a sensor molecule such as NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and the cysteine aspartase caspase-1 [20]. The inflammasome plays a significant role in the regulation of the inflammatory response [21,22,23,24,25] by modulating the innate immune response through the activation of caspase-1, the processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, as well as the programmed cell death mechanism of pyroptosis [26]. The inflammasome has been shown to contribute to a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis [27,28,29,30,31], Parkinson’s disease [32,33], Alzheimer’s disease [34,35], inflammaging [36,37] and metabolic syndrome [38,39]. Several of these diseases, with an inflammasome etiology, have also been suggested to be relevant in the context of space flight such as the development of dementia [40], altered aging and inflammation [41] or diabetes [42]. Hence, it is important to understand the effects of space flight on inflammasome signaling to develop therapies against specific targets of the immune response to protect and improve the performance of astronauts not only during a mission, but also their health on Earth [43,44]. It has been shown that space radiation affects hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks [45], spatial navigation and episodic memory formation [46,47], which is very important for the overall health of astronauts [43,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. In addition, it has been suggested that space radiation affects the cortex and causes altered cognitive flexibility and synaptic plasticity, which contribute to cognitive deficits [58]. A recent study used the anti-oxidant LGM2605 to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in an in vitro model of lung vascular networks that were exposed to γ-rays and mixed-field radiation sources to mimic some of the space flight conditions in vitro [59]. The study found that 3–4 keV/µm and 8–10 keV/µm linear energy transfer (LET) proton radiation elevated the levels of NLRP3, and that this increase can be targeted with anti-oxidant approaches [59]. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effect of space flight on the expression of inflammasome proteins and inflammatory cytokines in mice that were part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission (RR-1) on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft that spent 37 to 38 days at the International Space Station (ISS).2. Materials and Methods Animal procedures were approved by IACUC numbers NASA: NAS-13-002-Y1 and CASIS: CAS-13-001-Y1 for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center and the Kennedy Space Center in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. 2.1. Flight Animals This animal study was approved by the NASA Ames Research Center and The Kennedy Space Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Brain tissue samples were obtained by the authors through an award from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft [60]. During the flight, animals were kept at an ambient temperature of 26 to 28 °C in a 12 h light and dark cycle. Flight animals received water and a food bar diet specifically designed by NASA ad libitum. RR-1 mission animals were on board the Dragon capsule for 4 days (transit time) and then spent 37 days in the ISS (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Study timeline.RR-1 (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/RR-1, accessed on 9 March 2025) lasted 37 days, and according to the NASA Open Science Data Repository′s (OSDR) Environmental Data App, between 21 September and 23 September, these mice experienced temperature changes ranging from 18.3 °C to 26.69 °C. On 24 September, the temperature stabilized between 21 and 23 °C. Importantly, mice in the ISS (flight group) and in the ground control group experienced the same temperature conditions. Overall, the lowest temperature in the ISS during RR-1 was 18.50 °C and the highest temperature was 26.80 °C, with a mean temperature of 22.76 °C, whereas in the ground control group, the lowest temperature was 18.30 °C and the maximum was 27.10 °C (mean temperature 22.76 °C). Moreover, telemetry data indicated that mice in the flight group experienced initial higher CO2 levels at around 2621 ppm on 20 September, whereas mice in the ground group experienced much lower CO2 levels at approximately 476 ppm. By 27 September, both groups of mice experienced similar CO2 conditions through the rest of the flight, approximately between 1868 ppm and 4690 ppm. The minimum CO2 level in the ISS group was 1862 ppm and the maximum was 4667 ppm (mean 3197.27, median 3192 ppm), whereas in the ground group, the minimum was 438 ppm, the maximum was 4690 ppm and the mean was 2853.74. The median was 3188 ppm. Moreover, by October 25th, mice in the ISS experienced an accumulated radiation dose of 7.17 mGy/day. In the ISS group, the minimum galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) dose was 0.13 mGy/day, and the maximum was 0.14 mGy/day (mean 0.13 mGy/day). Furthermore, the radiation experienced as a result of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) ranged between 0.06 and 0.10 mGy/day (mean 0.07 mGy/day). Together, these accounted for a minimum total dose of 0.19 mGy/day, a maximum of 0.23 mGy/day and an average of 0.20 mGy/day.2.2. Ground Control Animals Animals were kept in similar conditions to flight animals (ambient temperature of 26 to 28 °C in a 12 h light and dark cycle). Telemetry data (with a 4-day delay) from the flight group were used to keep the ground control animals under similar conditions (housed in RR-1 flight hardware within an environmental simulator under the same conditions as the ISS). Water and food conditions for this group were the same as for the flight animal group as described.2.3. Vivarium and Baseline Animals Animals in the vivarium group were animals that were housed under standard vivarium conditions and remained alive for the duration of study. Animals in the baseline group consisted of mice that were euthanized at the time when the animals in the flight group were launched.2.4. Brain Dissection Within 4 h of splashdown, flight and ground control animals were sacrificed and brains were removed and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. For the study focusing on the forebrain, microdissections of the entire hippocampus and primary motor cortex were performed following well-established rodent brain microdissection protocols [61,62,63], and a brain atlas served as a reference to ensure accuracy of brain region identification [64]. Following brain dissection, samples were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Tissues used in this study consisted of brain cortex, hippocampus and rest of the tissue from the brain areas are referred as “other than cortex and hippocampus”.2.5. Immunoblotting Analysis of inflammasome signaling proteins in brain protein lysates by immunoblotting was carried out as described in [65]. Accordingly, brain lysates (25 μg) were run and resolved in 4–20% Criterion TGX Stain-Free precast gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) prior to transfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies against caspase-1 (Novus Biologicals Centennial, CO, USA), ASC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), and IL-1β (Cell Signaling, Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h followed by HRP-linked secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 45 min. β-actin (1:5000, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a standard and protein loading control. Membranes were imaged with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad) following enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis for relative protein quantification was carried out with UN-SCAN-IT gel 6.3 Software (Silk Scientific Corporation, Vineyard, UT, USA).2.6. Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) Using protein lysates, a V-PLEX ECLIA kit (MSD) was used to measure the inflammatory profile in the different brain sections as described in [66,67] using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM (MSD, Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, to measure the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10, after washing steps, the plate was incubated overnight with 50 µL of samples. The following day, after washing steps, samples were incubated in detection antibodies for 2 h followed by 3 more washing steps and the addition of the 2X Read Buffer (MSD, Rockville, MD, USA). After obtaining the quantity of protein in pg/mL for each analyte using the MESO-QuickPlex SQ-120MM, samples were then normalized to total protein concentration per sample.2.7. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were carried out with Prism 10.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics were first calculated. Data were tested for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk Test. Comparisons between the flight and ground groups were carried out by a one-tail t-test when data met normality and by the Mann–Whittney test when data were not normally distributed.3. Results 3.1. Levels of Inflammasome Signaling Molecules Are Decreased in the Brain of Mice That Experienced Spaceflight It has been previously shown that space travel affects the immune response [11]. To test the effects of spaceflight on inflammasome activation in the brain, we carried out an immunoblot analysis of brain areas other than cortex and hippocampus from mice that were in the ISS for approximately 1 month (Figure 1). Our findings indicate that caspase-1 (95% CI = Ground [1.06–5.9], Flight [0.3–2.3]) (Figure 2A), ASC (Ground [1.3–7.6], Flight [0.6–3.5]) (Figure 2B) and IL-1β (Ground [1.8–5.4], Flight [0.8–2.7]) (Figure 2C) were significantly decreased in the mice that were in the ISS when compared to the ground control group. In addition, the expression levels for all the inflammasome proteins analyzed in these studies in the vivarium group and those in the baseline group were similar to the spaceflight group (Figure S1). Together, these findings indicate that the expression levels of inflammasome signaling proteins in the brain of mice are lower in the mice that were in the ISS (flight) than the mice in the ground control group.

Inflammasome Proteins Are Decreased in the Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice After Spaceflight We then aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome signaling proteins present in the cortex (Figure 3A) and hippocampus (Figure 3B). Accordingly, immunoblot analysis of cortical and hippocampal protein lysates suggested that similar to our previously described findings (Figure 2), there was a trend towards decreased inflammasome activation in the cortex (Figure 3A) and the hippocampus (Figure 3B) of mice after spaceflight when compared to the ground control group. In addition, the brains of mice in the baseline group also had significantly lower levels of inflammasome activation in the cortex and hippocampus, which were similar to the protein expression levels in the flight group. Moreover, animals in the vivarium group presented much higher inflammasome protein levels than under baseline and spaceflight conditions. These findings suggest that in the cortex and hippocampus, inflammasome activation is lower after spaceflight. Figure 3.

Data were normalized to β-actin as a protein loading control. N = 2 per group.3.3. Levels of Tnf-α and Il12p70 Are Decreased in the Brain of Mice After Spaceflight Gene expression changes associated with inflammation have been described in the brains of mice who experienced spaceflight conditions and remained in the ISS for over 30 days [61]. To determine the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in the brain of mice in the ground control and spaceflight conditions, we carried out an ECLIA to measure the protein levels of TNF-α (Figure 4A), IL-2 (Figure 4B), IFN-γ (Figure 4C), IL-5 (Figure 4D), IL-6 (Figure 4E), IL-12p70 (Figure 4F) and IL-10 (Figure 4G) in brain areas other than the cortex and hippocampus. Accordingly, we found similar levels of these cytokines between the ground and flight groups (Figure 4). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower levels of TNF-α and IL-12p70 in the baseline group when compared to the other groups (Figure S2). Together, these trends suggest that these inflammatory cytokines were not altered in regions outside the cortex and hippocampus as a result of mission RR1. Figure 4.

Data were normalized to total protein. Data presented as box-plots with dots as all data points. N = 5 per group.3.4. Inflammatory Cytokine Levels in the Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice After Spaceflight To preliminarily determine the inflammatory profile in the cortex (Figure S3) and hippocampus (Figure S4) of mice, we used ECLIA to measure the levels of TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12p70 in protein lysates. However, due to the low sample size (N = 2), we were unable to carry out any statistical analyses in these tissues for the expression of these cytokines, yet the preliminary findings suggest that in the brain, the inflammatory response mediated by different cytokines is different in the cortex (Figure S3) than in the hippocampus (Figure S4) as a result of space flight.4. Discussion Previous studies have shown that the adaptive immune response is compromised as a result of space flight missions, resulting in the reactivation of viruses [68]. In addition, a previous study has shown that following 13 days of spaceflight on board of space shuttle mission STS-118, mice experienced a decrease in liver, spleen and thymus mass compared to the ground control group, which was consistent with the decreased number of lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophage and granulocytes [69]. However, how space flight affects the inflammatory response mediated by the inflammasome in the brain of mice has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we determined the levels of the key inflammasome signaling proteins caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β in the brain of mice after a stay of 37 days on the ISS. In addition, we measured the levels of cytokines that contribute significantly to the inflammatory response in the brain such as TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12p70 [70,71,72]. We used immunoblotting and ECLIA approaches to determine the inflammatory protein profile in the brains of mice that were in the ISS as part of the RR-1 mission that was launched on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 on 21 September 2014 and returned to earth on October 25th of the same year. Consistent with results from the STS-118 study, here we demonstrate that conditions experienced during a mission to low Earth orbit result in a significant decrease in levels of inflammasome proteins in the brain. Previous studies from RR-1 have shown that these mice experienced increased expression of genes associated with non-shivering thermogenesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue as well as increased expression of genes associated with glucose metabolism and adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue [73], consistent with other studies that showed altered liver [74] and muscle metabolism in these mice, which suggested that these mice experienced muscle atrophy [75] and that dietary changes might have been needed as a countermeasure [76]. During the RR-1 mission, mice in the flight group presented higher levels of CO2 than the ground control group (2621 ppm vs. 476 ppm). However, approximately a week later, mice in both groups experienced similar CO2 conditions. Increased CO2 levels in neutrophils for a couple of hours have been shown to increase IL-1β as well as the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 without affecting the levels of ASC [77]. Thus, it is possible that the changes seen between the ground control group and the flight group are due to the fluctuations in the CO2 levels. Furthermore, another variable that needs to be taken into account is that there was a difference between the vivarium group and the ground control group, bringing up the possibility of an effect due to the habitat. Notably, the CO2 levels in the vivarium group were the same as ambient air (~419 ppm), which were much lower than the ground group (median: 3188 ppm). In addition, some differences have been described between the vivarium and the animal enclosure module in which water and food consumption were higher in the animal enclosure module without a significant effect on overall body mass but some differences in the weight of certain organs were reported; however, that study did not report the weight of the brain [78]. Alternatively, taken together, it is possible that the effects seen in the flight group are in part due to the effects of the CO2 levels in the brain and the stress associated with space flight. Therefore, part of the elevated levels seen in the ground control group compared to the vivarium group may be due in part to the habitat environment and the CO2 levels. Importantly, the CO2 levels between the ground and the flight groups eventually stabilized after 7 days (ISS median: 3192 ppm; ground median: 3188 ppm). During the RR-1, mice in the flight group experienced an average of 0.20 mGy/day. Previous studies have shown that whole body exposure to higher doses from a 137CsCl radiation source (0.5 to 4 Gy) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in inflammasome activation as determined by the cleavage of caspase-1 at 1 day after exposure, an effect that was not present at 1 and 4 h; moreover, caspase-1 cleavage was significantly decreased by day 14 in immune cells [79]. Following this radiation protocol, inflammasome activation was mainly identified in macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells [79]. In addition, UV radiation has been shown to also activate inflammasomes [80]. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure of mice to silicon (0.5 Gy) or iron (0.15 Gy) ions results in increased cytokine production that is associated with infiltration of immune cells [81,82]. A recent study in a model of the lung vascular network exposed to low levels of radiation ranging from 0.25 to 1 Gy [83] showed increased expression of the inflammasome sensor NLRP3, which was decreased by treatment with LGM2605, a scavenger of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and active chlorine species (ACS), which is capable of reducing ionizing species due to radiation [59]. Similarly, in a study using a clinostat to model microgravity (10−3 gravitational force) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the authors showed that microgravity also increased the expression of NLRP3 consistent with increased expression of IL-1β and increased stress in the endoplasmic reticulum [84]. Moreover, a recent study showed that 8 Gy of radiation can inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages exposed to ATP and LPS by a mechanism that involves inhibiting TWIK2 expression [85]. However, whether the 7.17 mGy/day of accumulated radiation is also capable of causing lower levels of inflammasome protein expression experienced by mice in the flight group is yet to be tested. In this study, we have shown that in the brain of mice who were in the ISS, there were lower levels of the inflammasome signaling proteins caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β when compared to the ground control group. Interestingly, the levels of these proteins were similar to those levels present in the brains of the animals corresponding to the baseline group, which were sacrificed at the time of launch, suggesting that the inflammasome proteins continued to increase over time in the ground control group; however, this increase in inflammasome protein expression was arrested or stalled in the ISS group. We have previously shown that inflammasome activation in the brain increases as part of the inflammaging response [36,37,67]. In contrast to those inflammaging studies, the brain data from the mice in RR1 presented lower levels of these inflammasome proteins similar to those levels that were present in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch. These data would suggest that the innate immune response mediated by the inflammasome is not weakened by space flight, but that it does not develop as it normally does on Earth. Consistent with these findings on decreased inflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS), animals in RR-1 have also been shown to present younger epigenetic age in the retina than the ground control group [86]. Similarly, in the NASA Twin Study, the spaceflight twin presented a longer telomere length than his twin brother who remained on Earth, suggesting that in space, the aging process is slowed down [41]. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that spaceflight decreases brain inflammaging mediated by the inflammasome. It is possible that the decrease in the levels of inflammasome signaling proteins after spaceflight may be the result of a protective attempt to dampen the innate immune response in the brain following the stress experienced in space in the ISS. Stalled replication forks have been previously shown to limit the innate immune response mediated by cGAS–STING following replication stress and in order to maintain genome stability [87]. Thus, it is possible that the stress of exposure associated with radiation and microgravity [88,89,90,91,92,93] in the ISS mice resulted in stalled replication forks responsible for regulating inflammasome expression in the brain, which ultimately is responsible for the levels of inflammasome activation in the brain similar to those seen in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch (baseline group). Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines tested presented a similar pattern of expression between the baseline and flight groups. Moreover, our findings on the cortex and hippocampus suggest a differential expression of different cytokines in different parts of the brain, even with a very limited sample size. As anticipated, these findings suggest diverse roles in the inflammatory response mounted by different cytokines in the brain. In general, we would have anticipated that the inflammasome would be increased in the ISS group when compared to the baseline group based on previous studies looking at the peripheral immune response as a result of space flight. However, in this study, we have measured the inflammatory response in the CNS, suggesting that the immune response mounted in the brain as a result of space flight differs between the CNS and the periphery, an effect that is perhaps due to the relatively immune-privileged status of the brain owing to the characteristics of the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, similar observations have been previously reported in which spaceflight conditions resulted in immune dysfunctions and dysregulated inflammation [94,95]. Future studies are needed to confirm these results in other missions. However, consistent with these results, a previous study in the brain of mice that were in the ISS for 35 days and were flown on board SpaceX-12 as part of RR9 showed downregulation of immune genes [61]. Furthermore, in this study, only female mice were used. Thus, future studies are needed to better understand the sex differences associated with space flight in the inflammatory response in the brain, considering that previous studies have shown that brain cells respond differently in males vs. females to space-related radiation conditions [96,97,98,99]. Another limitation of this study is the low sample size characteristic of this type of space biology studies. In addition, although the trends are similar across different brain areas, it is not clear what areas of the brain are included in those that did not include the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, since we have only analyzed samples from RR-1, we were not able to compare the results of RR-1 to other missions. Thus, we do not know if the results of this study could be generalized to space flight in general or if these findings are particular to events/conditions that took place during the RR-1 mission. Future, studies should aim at analyzing mouse brains from other missions with larger sample sizes, as well as studies with more accurately described dissected brain areas, and with considerations for sex differences. Furthermore, it would be important to compare these findings in the rodent brain to blood-based biomarkers obtained from astronauts in missions of different durations. In conclusion, this study offers for the first time information on the effects of spaceflight on the innate immune response mediated by the inflammasome in the mouse brain after inhabiting the ISS for approximately one month. Thus, it is important to expand on these findings in the future to develop effective countermeasures against the detrimental effects associated with space flight.Acknowledgments Figures created with BioRender.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells14060417/s1: Figure S1: Inflammasome proteins in the brain.

    "abstract": "Abstract Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.

    "results": "Results The mouse cardiac transcriptome after immunization on the ISS The transcriptomic changes induced in the heart following vaccination with tetanus toxoid plus the adjuvant CpG versus flight saline were identified using RNAseq (n = 3 per group) (Fig. 1a). The hearts of mice vaccinated in flight showed 658 upregulated and 472 downregulated transcripts (p < 0.01) when compared to flight saline mice (Fig. 1b). Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on all significantly expressed transcripts indicated that inflammatory and immune responses were most highly activated (Fig. 1c, d). A comparative overview of differential transcript expression in flight-immunized mice and flight saline mice is shown in the heat map (Fig. 1e). The data collected from RNA sequencing was uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to assess the impact of immunization in space on major biological processes in the heart. A graphical summary of the regulation of these processes is shown in Fig. 1f. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), interferon-gamma (IFNγ), interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were predicted to be activated (orange). These signaling transcripts promote immune responses and enhance pathway activation. Similarly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified an upregulation of the overall inflammatory response (Fig. 1g). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The Impact of Tetanus Toxoid + CpG Immunization on the Heart in Space. (a) Two groups of mice were sent to the ISS for 34–35 days. One group was vaccinated with tetanus toxoid plus CpG 13 days before launch, and again after 21 days in space. A second group, vaccinated with saline only, served as a control (created with BioRender.com). Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group. (b) The volcano plot identified significant differences in the flight-immunized mice in reference to the flight control. The red clusters show a positive change, and the blue clusters show a negative change in transcript expression compared to spaceflight controls. (c) GO Enrichment analysis of statistically significant transcripts (p < 0.05) shows the enriched processes in flight-immunized mice versus flight saline mice. (d) KEGG analysis revealed that the statistically significant transcripts promoted an immune response and inflammation in the heart. (e) The heatmap lists the top 80 up- and down-regulated genes in the flight-immunized mice when compared to the flight-saline mice. Many highly regulated genes in flight-immunized mice (left three panels) were focused on immune-associated markers when compared to flight control mice (right three panels), where, in the heat map, red shows upregulation and blue downregulation in Fragments Per Kilobase Million. (f) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of all statistically significant, differentially expressed transcripts predicted increased cytokine signaling as well as recruitment and response of immune cells (orange = predicted activation, blue = predicted downregulation). (g) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) shows that the inflammatory response was upregulated in the flight-immunized mice when compared to flight saline (FDR q-value = 0.0) Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of cardiomyocytes Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or pattern recognition receptors, were analyzed for increased expression following vaccination. The adjuvant used in this study, CpG ODN 1826, is recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [31]. However, vaccination with TT + CpG in space showed a trend toward elevated expression of several other TLRs in cardiovascular tissue. In flight-immunized mice, there was a significant increase in expression of Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 when compared to the flight control group. (Fig. 2a, b). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified enrichment of Toll-like receptors 1–9 and 11–13 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, there was a significant upregulation of receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11, and 18 (2 < fold change (fc) < 6,000, p-value < 0.05, Fig. 2d). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Genes Encoding Toll-Like Receptors are Induced in the Heart after Immunization in Space. a, b) Transcriptomic analysis showed induction of genes for Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 following immunization in spaceflight when compared to flight control. c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of genes associated with Toll-like receptor pathways. The enriched genes were depicted in red, while the genes that were not enriched were shown in blue. In this representation, the relative intensity of the color indicates the strength of gene enrichment (e.g., saturated red versus light red) or decreased gene enrichment (e.g., saturated blue versus light blue) d) Receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11 and 18 were upregulated in flight-immunized mice when compared against flight control mice. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per groupWhen CpG activates TLR9, it promotes a cascade of signaling molecules within cardiomyocytes that leads to the translocation of transcription factors IRF7 and NF-κB to the nucleus. Once they enter the cells, they will begin transcription of IFNα and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. This proposed mechanism of inflammation in cardiomyocytes is outlined in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Inflammatory Response in Cardiomyocytes. a) NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines is induced in cardiomyocytes following CpG activation of endogenous Toll-like receptor 9. Downstream effects promote an inflammatory response in cardiac tissue (created with BioRender.com). b, c) TLR9 expression was significantly upregulated following vaccination of CpG alone in flight, on the ground, and post-TT + CpG administration in flight mice only (n = 3–5, 2 < fc < 22, t-test, p-value < 0.05). d, e) NF-κB induction occurred via CpG-only administration on the ground but required combined administration of TT plus CpG in space (n = 3–5, fc > 1.5, t-test, p-value < 0.05). The flight and ground TT + CpG groups and the flight and ground CpG-only group were each normalized to their appropriate control groupsOn Earth, CpG alone can evoke an immune response through activation of TLR9 and, subsequently, NF-κB (Fig. 3b, d). In spaceflight mice, RT-qPCR was used to show that there was a significant elevation in TLR9 expression following vaccination with CpG alone. However, administration of CpG alone in space was not sufficient to lead to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3c, e). In flight, activation of NF-κB only occurred when administration of the adjuvant CpG was combined with tetanus toxoid. Inflammatory response induced in the heart after immunization in spaceflight To further our understanding of the effects of immunization in space, we used transcriptomic analysis in combination with RT-qPCR to conduct a targeted analysis. IPA predicted that immunization in flight promoted activation of NF-κB in cardiomyocytes, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, eventually, inflammation of the myocardium (Fig. 4a, Table S4-S5). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also identified upregulated transcripts that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway (Table S6). Transcription factor NF-κB is involved in inflammatory pathways where increased expression activates and maintains the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), a key modulator of chronic inflammation (Fig. 4b). Among the immune-related pathways most activated by vaccination in flight mice, interleukin 6 was one of the most significantly changed. Given the changes in gene expression related to the regulation of IL-6 (Fig. 4c), we focused on transcripts identified by GO enrichment analysis as related to the regulation of inflammatory pathways. Signaling from its receptor, IL6rα (Fig. 2d), promotes the transition of infiltration from neutrophilic to mononuclear, furthering inflammation from acute to chronic [32, 33]. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Inflammation Occurs in Mouse Hearts Immunized in Space. (a) According to IPA, transcripts that lead to inflammation of the myocardium were predicted to be upregulated in immunized flight mice when compared to saline controls (orange = predicted activation). (b) NF-κB is a known regulator of signaling molecules which activate processes such as inflammation (created with BioRender.com). (c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of Interleukin 6 production following immunization with TT + CpG in space. d-f) Markers of inflammation, including NF-κB, IL-17A, and IL22ra2, were evaluated via RT-qPCR and were shown to be activated in the mouse heart post-vaccination (1.5 ≤ fc ≤ 4 in flight-immunized mice, p-value < 0.05). g) STAT3 was significantly upregulated in all immunized mice when compared to controls (fc > 1, p-value < 0.05). h) IFNγ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (fc ≥ 2, p-value < 0.05). Flight-immunized and ground-immunized groups were each normalized against their own flight or ground control. i) Macrophages in the heart of flight-immunized mice were predicted to be activated according to IPA, where upregulation is identified by an orange color and downregulated transcripts are identified in blue (created with BioRender.com). Flight-immunized versus flight-control mice were compared by uploading transcripts which were altered in expression at p-value < 0.05In order to verify that inflammation was upregulated in spaceflight after immunization, likely through an NF-κB-dependent pathway, RT-qPCR analysis was conducted on both flight groups of mice, control and immunized, as well as comparable ground controls. Vaccination led to a significant increase in NF-κB expression in flight-immunized mice, which was not observed in ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4d). Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-22rα2) were similarly induced in the flight-immunized mice, but not in ground-immunized mice (Figure e, f). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) were elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4g, h). Cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were analyzed by RT-qPCR but were not induced in mice which were immunized in space (Figure S1). Transcripts encoding a subset of cytokines specific to the NF-κB inflammatory pathway were elevated in mice following immunization while housed on the ISS. Although we did not identify specific cell populations in our bulk transcriptomic analysis, macrophage activation was predicted in the immunized flight mice when compared to their saline-treated counterparts (Fig. 4i). IPA predicted that a pro-inflammatory response of macrophages occurs via IL-6 activation, and polarization of M1 macrophages occurs through interleukin 12 (IL-12) activation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of IL-12 production after TT + CpG vaccination in flight-immunized mice (Figure S1). Immunization in spaceflight amplifies cytoskeletal rearrangements Transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were significantly induced following immunization in space. Elevated transcripts with fold changes above 4,000 are listed in Fig. 5a, along with their functional role. These transcripts enhance signal transduction and motility between cells and mediate tubulin protein and actin-based cytoskeletal filaments. The cytoskeletal-associated transcription factor signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) promoted cardiac protection through the regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-κB. Elevated transcripts in flight-immunized mice as compared to flight-control mice are shown in Fig. 5b and c, in which each distinct color denotes a different mouse in each flight group. The individual data points indicate the differential transcript expression of each of the cytoskeletal-related markers. According to the IPA and GSEA analysis, transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were elevated following IFNγ activation (Tables S7, S8). This activation promotes leukocyte activation, mononuclear leukocyte migration, cell transmigration, and inflammatory responses (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5.

Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group Transcripts protecting the heart from oxidative stress are induced in spaceflight Transcripts that aid in protecting the heart from the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were elevated after immunization in space (Fig. 6a, b). Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (Trpm2) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1) respond to inflammation by maintaining homeostasis and were upregulated in flight mice after immunization. Many of the protective transcripts induced in this model exhibited a fold change exceeding 1,000 in the flight-immunized mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6a). RT-qPCR was used to further validate the transcriptomic data. We analyzed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which protects various organ systems, including the heart, against the effects of oxidative stress [34–36]. HGF transcript levels were significantly increased in all immunized mice (Fig. 6c). Notably, glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), or prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), mediators of oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species stabilization, were not induced in flight-immunized mice (Fig. 6d-f).

Many of these markers lead to cell and mitochondrial protection.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur in the mouse heart following immunization with TT + CpG in the spaceflight environment. A shift in cytokine expression and activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to inflammation, occurred following vaccine administration. Although reports of myocarditis associated with vaccination on Earth are rare [37, 38], immunization with an adjuvant under microgravity conditions aboard the ISS can activate transcripts associated with inflammation in the heart. Tetanus toxoid vaccinations have been implemented as part of health regimes worldwide, commonly as part of the TDAP vaccination series [39]. The tetanus toxoid vaccine contains an inactivated form of the tetanus toxin. This version is recognized by the body, priming immune cells for future encounters. Tetanus is a potentially life-threatening disease commonly found on metal surfaces. Vaccinations have been developed to prevent the bacterial neurotoxin that causes the disease. The tetanus vaccine is first administered at two months of age and is followed by boosters every ten years through adulthood [39]. Our study utilized the tetanus toxin vaccination model since it has the potential to be relevant for astronauts on long-duration space missions. Accordingly, vaccinations and boosters for other diseases should be studied in the future for prolonged missions. It has recently been reported that thirteen strains of E. bugandensis, a drug-resistant bacterium, were isolated from the ISS [40]. Under stress, mutations in these strains occurred such that they evolved to become distinct compared to their Earth counterparts [40]. Astronauts may require immunization while in space due to these or other potential bacteria, including Clostridium tetani, the bacteria that causes tetanus [41]. Understanding how space changes the response to pathogens is important, especially because vaccination in flight elicits a dampened immune response when compared to vaccination on Earth [42, 43]. Changes in the physical environment can disrupt cell function and cell signaling. Immune cells readily respond to cytokine signaling. Microgravity produces a shift in the expression of cytokines and their receptors [44–46]. In space, receptors that activate T cells, such as Toll-like and interleukin receptors, demonstrate reduced signaling. If the receptors present on immune cells are disrupted, downstream activation and proliferation of the cell will be inhibited [47]. In space, reports have shown that spleen and thymus mass decrease post-flight [48, 49]. Furthermore, microgravity impedes proper adhesion of mononuclear cells. Suppression of surface adhesion molecules, such as CD62L and HLA-DR, prevents cell-to-cell signaling, tissue migration, and antigen presentation, dampening the overall immune response [50]. One proposed method of improving immune responses during spaceflight is the inclusion of adjuvants, such as CpG, during immunization. On Earth, CpG, an immune-stimulating molecule, acts as an agonist for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which promotes the activation of B cells, leading to a more robust immune reaction [51–53]. TLR9 stimulation can activate IRF7 signaling, which regulates T cells through IFNα release [54]. This effect appears to occur in our model following immunization with CpG alone. Alternatively, TLR9 activation can induce NF-κB which leads to inflammation [55]. The response triggered by the interaction between TLR9 and NF-κB on Earth has been reported to induce inflammation in multiple organ systems, including the lungs [56]. TLR9 is also known to be expressed by cardiomyocytes [57]. Once a cardiomyocyte responds to TLR9 signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, and a domino effect activates inflammation in neighboring cardiomyocytes via stimulation of the NF-κB pathway [58, 59]. The subsequent cytokine release activates resident macrophages [60]. The cardiomyocyte-specific inflammatory response leads to cardiac remodeling [61]. Our findings suggest that activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, in addition to those associated with TLR9, can occur when tetanus toxoid + CpG is administered in the spaceflight environment. TLR7, 8 and 13 transcripts were significantly elevated in our model. Although TLR13 has no analog in humans, TLR7 and TLR8 are present in humans and can be identified on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on cardiomyocytes [62–66]. TLR7 recognizes pathogens and initiates an immune response by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and consequently, TLR7 antagonists inhibit cardiomyocyte inflammation [67]. TLR signaling leads to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1) activation. MyD88 activation, utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, induces NF-κB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines [68]. In cardiomyocytes, expression of TLR8 and its interaction with MyD88 can initiate and maintain a chronic immune response in the heart [64]. Macrophages may also play a role in cardiac inflammation through cytokine release and infiltration into cardiovascular tissue. Activated resident or infiltrating cardiac macrophages can undergo cytoskeletal remodeling, as identified in flight-immunized mice, which may be attributed to tubulin re-organization [69]. Plectin (Plec) transcripts were upregulated almost 15,000-fold in flight-immunized mice. Plec proteins are involved in the organization and stabilization of the cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation [70]. When activated, macrophages become plectin-positive [71, 72]. Similarly, allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), another marker of inflammation which is primarily expressed by macrophages, alters the cytoskeleton and was elevated in our model [73]. AIF1 interacts with TLR2 and TLR4, which were enriched in our study. These TLRs are important mediators of inflammatory pathways [74]. AIF1 also plays a role in the activation of the transcription factor the NF-κB which can induce a potent inflammatory response [75]. Prolonged activation of NF-κB can lead to tissue damage [76]. Inflammatory markers were not induced in the heart by the spaceflight environment in the absence of immunization [11], nor were they elevated in the mice which were immunized on the ground. However, inflammation associated with elevated expression of NF-κB was identified in the hearts of mice that received the TT + CpG vaccination in space. In this study, immunization can be viewed as a two-hit stressor on the heart, where one hit is represented by the vaccine itself, and the second hit by the spaceflight environment. Under these conditions, the combination of two hits in space versus one hit on Earth influences the cellular response, impacting the activation of signaling pathways and leading to inflammation. On Earth, TNF-α and IL-1β activate the canonical NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathway [55]. In our study, these inflammatory signaling molecules were not activated in the hearts of immunized mice either on Earth or in space. In mice which were immunized in space, IL-17A and IL-22 were induced, resulting in activation of NF-κB which is capable of initiating a positive feedback loop by sustaining the release of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines [77]. This response was not evident in the mice immunized on the ground. Additionally, prolonged activation of STAT3, for example, can lead to inflammatory disease [78]. In the heart, when STAT3 is elevated in the presence of IL-6, a positive feedback loop maintains STAT3 in the phosphorylated state for extended periods [79]. This effect is regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), whose activity may differ in the spaceflight environment [79]. Prolonged STAT3 activation leads to cardiac dysfunction [79, 80]. The immune response may be prolonged in flight mice due to continued activation of regulators of STAT3. The spaceflight environment impacts the immune system as a consequence of both microgravity and radiation [42, 81]. The role of NF-κB and the mechanisms by which inflammation occurs in various organs during spaceflight are currently under investigation in several laboratories [82, 83]. Interestingly, during a typical inflammatory response on Earth, NF-κB activates pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNFα [55]. However, recent studies show that in some cases, the selective activation of cytokines, such as IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-17, during spaceflight depends on the antigen and/or adjuvant administered [84]. Furthermore, an inflammatory response can be initiated by resident and systemic cells, and the response may be tissue-specific. In the heart, inflammation can disrupt the network of microtubules and intermediate filaments in cardiomyocytes that alter the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton [85, 86]. If inflammation becomes chronic after stress, it can direct cardiomyocytes toward ventricular remodeling [61, 87]. This would be consistent with the idea that the prolonged stress due to spaceflight, combined with the increase in inflammation after exposure to an antigen, could lead to cardiac remodeling in astronauts. Interestingly, immunization in space induced transcripts that function to protect against oxidative stress in the presence of inflammation, including HGF, Gpx4, and TRPM2. HGF is expressed during myocardial injury and protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of caspase activation [34, 88]. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), one of the most highly expressed oxidative stress-related transcripts in flight-immunized mice and a key antioxidant agent, inhibits ferroptosis through the reduction of Glutathione [89, 90]. The expression of this gene stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential [91]. TRPM2 is an ion channel which is activated during periods of oxidative stress and helps to maintain the balance of ions in the heart [92, 93]. TRPM2 plays a vital role in protecting the heart from damage caused by reactive oxygen species [92, 93]. Cytoprotective transcripts, which are elevated in the heart in space, may contribute to maintaining homeostasis in the cardiac environment. DNA replication (Figure S2), which was elevated in our study, may reflect an increase in cardiomyocyte nuclei number in the absence of cell division which has been reported in association with improved cell responses and survival during stress exposure [94, 95]. Cardiac protection can aid in adaptation and may account for the absence of reported long-term adverse effects on the heart following space travel. Spaceflight studies include limitations such as the number of animals which can be housed on the ISS and the number of variables that can be tested at any one time. Consequently, our study was limited to the use of same-sex, same-strain mice. Future work using the experimental design reported here should include both male and female mice to address this question further in the spaceflight environment, with and without immunization. The use of inbred mice and a defined immunization schedule over a specified amount of time should allow for reproducibility of the current findings and an expansion of the information gained here in mice of both sexes.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion A 30-day exposure to the spaceflight environment, combined with immunological events, such as vaccination or exposure to a pathogen, can induce inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling in the mouse heart. Protective transcripts are induced in the heart, which reduce oxidative stress associated with inflammatory responses and prevent cardiomyocyte loss. This report lends insight into the cardiovascular response to immune challenges in space and provides a foundation for future studies designed to elucidate whether inflammation in the heart is a transient or chronic effect following vaccination in the spaceflight environment.",

Copyright notice ID: 11892206 PMID: 40065216 Abstract Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.

Indeed, human and animal model studies have already shown structural and/or functional deficits in the musculoskeletal system, the lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, and immune system after spaceflight [1–3]. Of particular concern is the impact of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system. It is already well known that microgravity leads to significant fluid shifts and subsequent decreases in total blood volume, potentially changing physiological stressors inherent to normal heart function [4, 5]. Astronauts experience dysregulation of their lymphatic and blood circulatory systems while in space, resulting in a shift of fluids towards the head [5, 6]. Some investigators have also linked both microgravity and the space radiation environment to increased risk for cardiovascular disease [7, 8]. Inflammation is a well-known component of cardiovascular disease in ground-based studies [9, 10]. However, the link between inflammation and spaceflight-induced changes in cardiac function has not been extensively studied. Our previous work has demonstrated that the spaceflight environment does not induce cardiac inflammation in mice which were housed on the ISS for 30 days [11]. This is surprising as it has long been known that spaceflight can increase inflammatory markers in many tissues, including the musculoskeletal system, liver and kidneys [12–14]. In rare cases, immunization can induce myocarditis associated with cardiac inflammation [15–18]. We therefore sought to determine whether or not the stress of the spaceflight environment exacerbates the risk for vaccine-induced cardiac inflammation, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in astronauts. To explore the impact of combined physiological and immunological stressors on cardiovascular risk, RNAseq analysis was used to identify transcriptomic changes in the hearts of mice after immunization in space. Our results showed that immunization during spaceflight activated an inflammation-related gene expression response in the heart similar to myocarditis on Earth.Materials and methods Experimental animal model Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (FIACUC) (protocol #RR-12). The experiments described here were a component of a larger investigation which was focused on the impact of immunization in the context of the spaceflight environment. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of immunization on the heart in space. Heart tissue was provided to our laboratory by the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Eight- to nine-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Animal Care Facility. Due to the limited number of mice that could be approved for housing on the ISS and to facilitate the interpretation of the data, the inbred mice in all of the experimental and control groups were selected to be of the same age and sex. This allowed us to distribute a uniform set of mice of the same strain and sex into the various groups. Mice were acclimatized for 1 to 2 weeks before study initiation. During this period, their living conditions were controlled for temperature and humidity, and a 12:12 h light: dark cycle was established. Treatments were assigned randomly for each cage. The body mass of the mice within each of the cages and across groups was measured to ensure that there were no statistically significant differences in body mass within and between the groups of flight and ground control mice. The entire cage of mice was not used for the project if any mice in the cage showed signs of stress, such as over-grooming or fighting during the adaptation period, in order to maintain consistency across all treatment and control groups. Complete cages were then divided into one of three treatment groups (Saline, TT + CpG, CpG only) for ground controls and flight mice. All five mice within one cage received the same treatment. For the purpose of this study, we focused on thirty mice, as indicated in Table 1, in order to identify the effects of immunization with tetanus toxoid plus adjuvant in the context of spaceflight. Table 1. Animal numbers in flight and control groups Group Treatment Total N number per group Samples used for RT-qPCR Samples used for Sequencing Flight TT + CpG 5 5 3 Saline 5 5 3 CpG only 5 3 − Ground TT + CpG 5 5 − Saline 5 5 − CpG only 5 3 − Total: n = 30 Open in a new tabGround controls remained at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES), a controlled environment chamber that matched temperature, humidity and CO2 levels from the ISS on a 48-hour delay via telemetry. Flight groups were flown to Wallops Island (VA), placed on board the Northrop Grumman robotic resupply spacecraft Cygnus mission 11 (NG-11), and sent to the International Space Station (ISS). To ensure a robust immune response while in space, mice were first vaccinated on the ground 13 days prior to launch with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of either 0.1 ml saline vehicle (control), 0.1 ml of 10Lf/ml tetanus toxoid (AJ Vaccines, Denmark) + 0.1 ml of 0.8 mg/ml CpG ODN 1826 adjuvant (InvivoGen), or + 0.1 ml of 0.8 mg/ml CpG ODN 1826 adjuvant only, allowing time for the development of immunological memory. A second, identical vaccination was given to the flight mice 21 days after launch. Saline was administered to flight control animals. Finally, the flight mice were euthanized via IP injection of ketamine/xylazine (3 mg/0.9 mg ketamine/xylazine in a volume of 300 μl PBS) 13–14 days after the second immunization. The euthanized mice were wrapped in foil and kept frozen at -76 °C until they were returned to Earth. Hearts were later extracted from semi-thawed animals, flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C until RNA was prepared for transcriptomics. Comparable ground treatment (TT+CpG, CpG only) and control (saline) mice were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center.RNA and cDNA synthesis To extract RNA, < 25 mg of tissue was cut on dry ice and the tissue was collected and suspended in QIAzol® Lysis Reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Samples were then homogenized, and RNA was extracted using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Sample quality was assessed with gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III and the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis The RNA samples for three spaceflight saline-injected control mice and three spaceflight mice which were immunized with TT + CpG, were shipped to LC Sciences (Houston, TX, USA) on dry ice for RNA sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis. RNA with a RIN above 8 (Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer) was used to generate a sequencing library. The poly(A) RNA sequencing library was made following Illumina’s TruSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol. Quality control was done using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip. Sequencing was performed on Illumina NovaseqTM 6000 following the vendor’s protocol. To analyze the RNA-seq data, the workflow involved using in-house Perl scripts in addition to Cutadapt (version 1.10) for trimming any adapter sequences and processing the raw sequence data [19]. A thorough assessment using FASTQC (version 0.10.1) was performed and the trimmed reads were aligned to the reference mouse genome (Ensembl release-101 mus_musculus; v101) using HISAT (version 2.0) [20]. Gene assembly was conducted by calculating the expression of genes based on the total number or coverage of reads aligning to each gene locus. Full-length transcripts and splice variants were assembled and quantitated using StringTie [21]. Individual transcriptomes were combined to create a complete transcriptome. This was done by merging transcripts using Perl scripts and GffCompare. Stringtie (version 1.3.4) and ballgown (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ballgown.html; version 3.20) were then used to approximate the expression levels of each completed transcript. StringTie was utilized to quantify mRNA expression levels across all six mice, as represented by the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) metric. Transcripts with a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.05 and an absolute fold change ≥ 2 were considered differentially expressed. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 and edgeR [22, 23]. These tools used a negative binomial distribution within a generalized linear model (GLM) framework for modeling RNA sequencing count data to identify significant changes in gene expression. This was followed by GO (2019.05) and KEGG (2019.05) enrichment analyses [24, 25]. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and insertion-deletion (Indel) analyses were carried out using SAMtools (version 0.1.19), and variant annotation was conducted with ANNOVAR (2017.09). For alternative splicing analysis, rMATS (version 4.1.1) was employed for use of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Differentially expressed genes and transcripts were uploaded for analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and DAVID Bioinformatics [26–29]. These programs analyze large-scale omics data to determine changes in pathway activation and biological function. Three flight immunized and three flight saline hearts were included in the transcriptomic analyses. All software used for RNA sequencing and downstream analysis is listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.RT-qPCR RT-qPCR was used to validate transcriptomic findings comparing the flight control and the flight TT + CpG, as well as comparable ground controls. In addition, administration of CpG only versus immunization with TT + CpG was assessed using quantitative PCR. Primer pairs were designed using  PrimerBlast (Table S3). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene. RT-qPCRs were run at 94oC for 10 min, 94oC for 15 s, 56-58oC (depending on the primer) for 60 s and 72oC for 30 s for 45 cycles. Results were analyzed using the delta delta cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) method for relative gene expression [30]. Five mouse hearts were analyzed in each ground control group as well as in each of the flight immunization and control mouse groups. Three to five technical replicates were used for each RT-qPCR analysis. Values for the flight-immunized group were normalized to their respective flight saline control group and ground-immunized group. To assess the normality of values, we conducted a Shapiro-Wilk test. If the values successfully passed this test, we proceeded with an unpaired t-test to determine their statistical significance. In the event that non-normality was detected in any dataset, we utilized Wilcoxon’s t-test to analyze their statistical significance. T-tests were performed on Graphpad’s Prism at a significant p-value less than 0.05 (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01, ***=p < 0.001, ****=p < 0.0001).Results The mouse cardiac transcriptome after immunization on the ISS The transcriptomic changes induced in the heart following vaccination with tetanus toxoid plus the adjuvant CpG versus flight saline were identified using RNAseq (n = 3 per group) (Fig. 1a). The hearts of mice vaccinated in flight showed 658 upregulated and 472 downregulated transcripts (p < 0.01) when compared to flight saline mice (Fig. 1b). Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on all significantly expressed transcripts indicated that inflammatory and immune responses were most highly activated (Fig. 1c, d). A comparative overview of differential transcript expression in flight-immunized mice and flight saline mice is shown in the heat map (Fig. 1e). The data collected from RNA sequencing was uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to assess the impact of immunization in space on major biological processes in the heart. A graphical summary of the regulation of these processes is shown in Fig. 1f. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), interferon-gamma (IFNγ), interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were predicted to be activated (orange). These signaling transcripts promote immune responses and enhance pathway activation. Similarly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified an upregulation of the overall inflammatory response (Fig. 1g). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The Impact of Tetanus Toxoid + CpG Immunization on the Heart in Space. (a) Two groups of mice were sent to the ISS for 34–35 days. One group was vaccinated with tetanus toxoid plus CpG 13 days before launch, and again after 21 days in space. A second group, vaccinated with saline only, served as a control (created with BioRender.com). Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group. (b) The volcano plot identified significant differences in the flight-immunized mice in reference to the flight control. The red clusters show a positive change, and the blue clusters show a negative change in transcript expression compared to spaceflight controls. (c) GO Enrichment analysis of statistically significant transcripts (p < 0.05) shows the enriched processes in flight-immunized mice versus flight saline mice. (d) KEGG analysis revealed that the statistically significant transcripts promoted an immune response and inflammation in the heart. (e) The heatmap lists the top 80 up- and down-regulated genes in the flight-immunized mice when compared to the flight-saline mice. Many highly regulated genes in flight-immunized mice (left three panels) were focused on immune-associated markers when compared to flight control mice (right three panels), where, in the heat map, red shows upregulation and blue downregulation in Fragments Per Kilobase Million. (f) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of all statistically significant, differentially expressed transcripts predicted increased cytokine signaling as well as recruitment and response of immune cells (orange = predicted activation, blue = predicted downregulation). (g) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) shows that the inflammatory response was upregulated in the flight-immunized mice when compared to flight saline (FDR q-value = 0.0)Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of cardiomyocytes Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or pattern recognition receptors, were analyzed for increased expression following vaccination. The adjuvant used in this study, CpG ODN 1826, is recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [31]. However, vaccination with TT + CpG in space showed a trend toward elevated expression of several other TLRs in cardiovascular tissue. In flight-immunized mice, there was a significant increase in expression of Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 when compared to the flight control group. (Fig. 2a, b). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified enrichment of Toll-like receptors 1–9 and 11–13 (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, there was a significant upregulation of receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11, and 18 (2 < fold change (fc) < 6,000, p-value < 0.05, Fig. 2d). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Genes Encoding Toll-Like Receptors are Induced in the Heart after Immunization in Space. a, b) Transcriptomic analysis showed induction of genes for Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 following immunization in spaceflight when compared to flight control. c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of genes associated with Toll-like receptor pathways. The enriched genes were depicted in red, while the genes that were not enriched were shown in blue. In this representation, the relative intensity of the color indicates the strength of gene enrichment (e.g., saturated red versus light red) or decreased gene enrichment (e.g., saturated blue versus light blue) d) Receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11 and 18 were upregulated in flight-immunized mice when compared against flight control mice. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per groupWhen CpG activates TLR9, it promotes a cascade of signaling molecules within cardiomyocytes that leads to the translocation of transcription factors IRF7 and NF-κB to the nucleus. Once they enter the cells, they will begin transcription of IFNα and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. This proposed mechanism of inflammation in cardiomyocytes is outlined in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Inflammatory Response in Cardiomyocytes. a) NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines is induced in cardiomyocytes following CpG activation of endogenous Toll-like receptor 9. Downstream effects promote an inflammatory response in cardiac tissue (created with BioRender.com). b, c) TLR9 expression was significantly upregulated following vaccination of CpG alone in flight, on the ground, and post-TT + CpG administration in flight mice only (n = 3–5, 2 < fc < 22, t-test, p-value < 0.05). d, e) NF-κB induction occurred via CpG-only administration on the ground but required combined administration of TT plus CpG in space (n = 3–5, fc > 1.5, t-test, p-value < 0.05). The flight and ground TT + CpG groups and the flight and ground CpG-only group were each normalized to their appropriate control groupsOn Earth, CpG alone can evoke an immune response through activation of TLR9 and, subsequently, NF-κB (Fig. 3b, d). In spaceflight mice, RT-qPCR was used to show that there was a significant elevation in TLR9 expression following vaccination with CpG alone. However, administration of CpG alone in space was not sufficient to lead to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3c, e). In flight, activation of NF-κB only occurred when administration of the adjuvant CpG was combined with tetanus toxoid.Inflammatory response induced in the heart after immunization in spaceflight To further our understanding of the effects of immunization in space, we used transcriptomic analysis in combination with RT-qPCR to conduct a targeted analysis. IPA predicted that immunization in flight promoted activation of NF-κB in cardiomyocytes, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, eventually, inflammation of the myocardium (Fig. 4a, Table S4-S5). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also identified upregulated transcripts that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway (Table S6). Transcription factor NF-κB is involved in inflammatory pathways where increased expression activates and maintains the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), a key modulator of chronic inflammation (Fig. 4b). Among the immune-related pathways most activated by vaccination in flight mice, interleukin 6 was one of the most significantly changed. Given the changes in gene expression related to the regulation of IL-6 (Fig. 4c), we focused on transcripts identified by GO enrichment analysis as related to the regulation of inflammatory pathways. Signaling from its receptor, IL6rα (Fig. 2d), promotes the transition of infiltration from neutrophilic to mononuclear, furthering inflammation from acute to chronic [32, 33]. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Inflammation Occurs in Mouse Hearts Immunized in Space. (a) According to IPA, transcripts that lead to inflammation of the myocardium were predicted to be upregulated in immunized flight mice when compared to saline controls (orange = predicted activation). (b) NF-κB is a known regulator of signaling molecules which activate processes such as inflammation (created with BioRender.com). (c) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of Interleukin 6 production following immunization with TT + CpG in space. d-f) Markers of inflammation, including NF-κB, IL-17A, and IL22ra2, were evaluated via RT-qPCR and were shown to be activated in the mouse heart post-vaccination (1.5 ≤ fc ≤ 4 in flight-immunized mice, p-value < 0.05). g) STAT3 was significantly upregulated in all immunized mice when compared to controls (fc > 1, p-value < 0.05). h) IFNγ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (fc ≥ 2, p-value < 0.05). Flight-immunized and ground-immunized groups were each normalized against their own flight or ground control. i) Macrophages in the heart of flight-immunized mice were predicted to be activated according to IPA, where upregulation is identified by an orange color and downregulated transcripts are identified in blue (created with BioRender.com). Flight-immunized versus flight-control mice were compared by uploading transcripts which were altered in expression at p-value < 0.05In order to verify that inflammation was upregulated in spaceflight after immunization, likely through an NF-κB-dependent pathway, RT-qPCR analysis was conducted on both flight groups of mice, control and immunized, as well as comparable ground controls. Vaccination led to a significant increase in NF-κB expression in flight-immunized mice, which was not observed in ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4d). Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-22rα2) were similarly induced in the flight-immunized mice, but not in ground-immunized mice (Figure e, f). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) were elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4g, h). Cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were analyzed by RT-qPCR but were not induced in mice which were immunized in space (Figure S1). Transcripts encoding a subset of cytokines specific to the NF-κB inflammatory pathway were elevated in mice following immunization while housed on the ISS. Although we did not identify specific cell populations in our bulk transcriptomic analysis, macrophage activation was predicted in the immunized flight mice when compared to their saline-treated counterparts (Fig. 4i). IPA predicted that a pro-inflammatory response of macrophages occurs via IL-6 activation, and polarization of M1 macrophages occurs through interleukin 12 (IL-12) activation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of IL-12 production after TT + CpG vaccination in flight-immunized mice (Figure S1).Immunization in spaceflight amplifies cytoskeletal rearrangements Transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were significantly induced following immunization in space. Elevated transcripts with fold changes above 4,000 are listed in Fig. 5a, along with their functional role. These transcripts enhance signal transduction and motility between cells and mediate tubulin protein and actin-based cytoskeletal filaments. The cytoskeletal-associated transcription factor signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) promoted cardiac protection through the regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-κB. Elevated transcripts in flight-immunized mice as compared to flight-control mice are shown in Fig. 5b and c, in which each distinct color denotes a different mouse in each flight group. The individual data points indicate the differential transcript expression of each of the cytoskeletal-related markers. According to the IPA and GSEA analysis, transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were elevated following IFNγ activation (Tables S7, S8). This activation promotes leukocyte activation, mononuclear leukocyte migration, cell transmigration, and inflammatory responses (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Cytoskeletal Interaction during Immune Response in Space. a) Top 18 significantly induced cytoskeletal markers with fold changes above 4,000. b, c) Analysis of differentially expressed transcripts revealed an upregulation associated with cytoskeletal rearrangement in flight-immunized mice (p < 0.05). d) Functions of IFNγ following activation in flight-immunized mice (created with BioRender.com). Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per groupTranscripts protecting the heart from oxidative stress are induced in spaceflight Transcripts that aid in protecting the heart from the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were elevated after immunization in space (Fig. 6a, b). Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (Trpm2) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1) respond to inflammation by maintaining homeostasis and were upregulated in flight mice after immunization. Many of the protective transcripts induced in this model exhibited a fold change exceeding 1,000 in the flight-immunized mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6a). RT-qPCR was used to further validate the transcriptomic data. We analyzed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which protects various organ systems, including the heart, against the effects of oxidative stress [34–36]. HGF transcript levels were significantly increased in all immunized mice (Fig. 6c). Notably, glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), or prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), mediators of oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species stabilization, were not induced in flight-immunized mice (Fig. 6d-f). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Elevated Expression of Transcripts Protecting the Heart from Oxidative Stress in Flight-immunized Mice. (a) Oxidative stress transcripts were significantly elevated in flight mice after immunization when normalized to flight control mice, according to transcriptomic analysis. (b) The function of several upregulated transcripts related to oxidative stress included protection from cell damage through increased response to stress and ROS. Many of these markers lead to cell and mitochondrial protection. (c) RT-qPCR analysis showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cardioprotective gene active during heart damage, was highly elevated in all immunized mice when normalized to their appropriate controls (fc ≥ 4, p-value < 0.05). d-f) RT-qPCR was used to verify that no significant change in common oxidative stress markers was detected in immunized mice when compared to flight control and ground immunized mice (p-value < 0.05)Discussion In this study, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur in the mouse heart following immunization with TT + CpG in the spaceflight environment. A shift in cytokine expression and activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to inflammation, occurred following vaccine administration. Although reports of myocarditis associated with vaccination on Earth are rare [37, 38], immunization with an adjuvant under microgravity conditions aboard the ISS can activate transcripts associated with inflammation in the heart. Tetanus toxoid vaccinations have been implemented as part of health regimes worldwide, commonly as part of the TDAP vaccination series [39]. The tetanus toxoid vaccine contains an inactivated form of the tetanus toxin. This version is recognized by the body, priming immune cells for future encounters. Tetanus is a potentially life-threatening disease commonly found on metal surfaces. Vaccinations have been developed to prevent the bacterial neurotoxin that causes the disease. The tetanus vaccine is first administered at two months of age and is followed by boosters every ten years through adulthood [39]. Our study utilized the tetanus toxin vaccination model since it has the potential to be relevant for astronauts on long-duration space missions. Accordingly, vaccinations and boosters for other diseases should be studied in the future for prolonged missions. It has recently been reported that thirteen strains of E. bugandensis, a drug-resistant bacterium, were isolated from the ISS [40]. Under stress, mutations in these strains occurred such that they evolved to become distinct compared to their Earth counterparts [40]. Astronauts may require immunization while in space due to these or other potential bacteria, including Clostridium tetani, the bacteria that causes tetanus [41]. Understanding how space changes the response to pathogens is important, especially because vaccination in flight elicits a dampened immune response when compared to vaccination on Earth [42, 43]. Changes in the physical environment can disrupt cell function and cell signaling. Immune cells readily respond to cytokine signaling. Microgravity produces a shift in the expression of cytokines and their receptors [44–46]. In space, receptors that activate T cells, such as Toll-like and interleukin receptors, demonstrate reduced signaling. If the receptors present on immune cells are disrupted, downstream activation and proliferation of the cell will be inhibited [47]. In space, reports have shown that spleen and thymus mass decrease post-flight [48, 49]. Furthermore, microgravity impedes proper adhesion of mononuclear cells. Suppression of surface adhesion molecules, such as CD62L and HLA-DR, prevents cell-to-cell signaling, tissue migration, and antigen presentation, dampening the overall immune response [50]. One proposed method of improving immune responses during spaceflight is the inclusion of adjuvants, such as CpG, during immunization. On Earth, CpG, an immune-stimulating molecule, acts as an agonist for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which promotes the activation of B cells, leading to a more robust immune reaction [51–53]. TLR9 stimulation can activate IRF7 signaling, which regulates T cells through IFNα release [54]. This effect appears to occur in our model following immunization with CpG alone. Alternatively, TLR9 activation can induce NF-κB which leads to inflammation [55]. The response triggered by the interaction between TLR9 and NF-κB on Earth has been reported to induce inflammation in multiple organ systems, including the lungs [56]. TLR9 is also known to be expressed by cardiomyocytes [57]. Once a cardiomyocyte responds to TLR9 signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, and a domino effect activates inflammation in neighboring cardiomyocytes via stimulation of the NF-κB pathway [58, 59]. The subsequent cytokine release activates resident macrophages [60]. The cardiomyocyte-specific inflammatory response leads to cardiac remodeling [61]. Our findings suggest that activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, in addition to those associated with TLR9, can occur when tetanus toxoid + CpG is administered in the spaceflight environment. TLR7, 8 and 13 transcripts were significantly elevated in our model. Although TLR13 has no analog in humans, TLR7 and TLR8 are present in humans and can be identified on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on cardiomyocytes [62–66]. TLR7 recognizes pathogens and initiates an immune response by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and consequently, TLR7 antagonists inhibit cardiomyocyte inflammation [67]. TLR signaling leads to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1) activation. MyD88 activation, utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, induces NF-κB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines [68]. In cardiomyocytes, expression of TLR8 and its interaction with MyD88 can initiate and maintain a chronic immune response in the heart [64]. Macrophages may also play a role in cardiac inflammation through cytokine release and infiltration into cardiovascular tissue. Activated resident or infiltrating cardiac macrophages can undergo cytoskeletal remodeling, as identified in flight-immunized mice, which may be attributed to tubulin re-organization [69]. Plectin (Plec) transcripts were upregulated almost 15,000-fold in flight-immunized mice. Plec proteins are involved in the organization and stabilization of the cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation [70]. When activated, macrophages become plectin-positive [71, 72]. Similarly, allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), another marker of inflammation which is primarily expressed by macrophages, alters the cytoskeleton and was elevated in our model [73]. AIF1 interacts with TLR2 and TLR4, which were enriched in our study. These TLRs are important mediators of inflammatory pathways [74]. AIF1 also plays a role in the activation of the transcription factor the NF-κB which can induce a potent inflammatory response [75]. Prolonged activation of NF-κB can lead to tissue damage [76]. Inflammatory markers were not induced in the heart by the spaceflight environment in the absence of immunization [11], nor were they elevated in the mice which were immunized on the ground. However, inflammation associated with elevated expression of NF-κB was identified in the hearts of mice that received the TT + CpG vaccination in space. In this study, immunization can be viewed as a two-hit stressor on the heart, where one hit is represented by the vaccine itself, and the second hit by the spaceflight environment. Under these conditions, the combination of two hits in space versus one hit on Earth influences the cellular response, impacting the activation of signaling pathways and leading to inflammation. On Earth, TNF-α and IL-1β activate the canonical NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathway [55]. In our study, these inflammatory signaling molecules were not activated in the hearts of immunized mice either on Earth or in space. In mice which were immunized in space, IL-17A and IL-22 were induced, resulting in activation of NF-κB which is capable of initiating a positive feedback loop by sustaining the release of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines [77]. This response was not evident in the mice immunized on the ground. Additionally, prolonged activation of STAT3, for example, can lead to inflammatory disease [78]. In the heart, when STAT3 is elevated in the presence of IL-6, a positive feedback loop maintains STAT3 in the phosphorylated state for extended periods [79]. This effect is regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), whose activity may differ in the spaceflight environment [79]. Prolonged STAT3 activation leads to cardiac dysfunction [79, 80]. The immune response may be prolonged in flight mice due to continued activation of regulators of STAT3. The spaceflight environment impacts the immune system as a consequence of both microgravity and radiation [42, 81]. The role of NF-κB and the mechanisms by which inflammation occurs in various organs during spaceflight are currently under investigation in several laboratories [82, 83]. Interestingly, during a typical inflammatory response on Earth, NF-κB activates pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNFα [55]. However, recent studies show that in some cases, the selective activation of cytokines, such as IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-17, during spaceflight depends on the antigen and/or adjuvant administered [84]. Furthermore, an inflammatory response can be initiated by resident and systemic cells, and the response may be tissue-specific. In the heart, inflammation can disrupt the network of microtubules and intermediate filaments in cardiomyocytes that alter the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton [85, 86]. If inflammation becomes chronic after stress, it can direct cardiomyocytes toward ventricular remodeling [61, 87]. This would be consistent with the idea that the prolonged stress due to spaceflight, combined with the increase in inflammation after exposure to an antigen, could lead to cardiac remodeling in astronauts. Interestingly, immunization in space induced transcripts that function to protect against oxidative stress in the presence of inflammation, including HGF, Gpx4, and TRPM2. HGF is expressed during myocardial injury and protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of caspase activation [34, 88]. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), one of the most highly expressed oxidative stress-related transcripts in flight-immunized mice and a key antioxidant agent, inhibits ferroptosis through the reduction of Glutathione [89, 90]. The expression of this gene stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential [91]. TRPM2 is an ion channel which is activated during periods of oxidative stress and helps to maintain the balance of ions in the heart [92, 93]. TRPM2 plays a vital role in protecting the heart from damage caused by reactive oxygen species [92, 93]. Cytoprotective transcripts, which are elevated in the heart in space, may contribute to maintaining homeostasis in the cardiac environment. DNA replication (Figure S2), which was elevated in our study, may reflect an increase in cardiomyocyte nuclei number in the absence of cell division which has been reported in association with improved cell responses and survival during stress exposure [94, 95]. Cardiac protection can aid in adaptation and may account for the absence of reported long-term adverse effects on the heart following space travel. Spaceflight studies include limitations such as the number of animals which can be housed on the ISS and the number of variables that can be tested at any one time. Consequently, our study was limited to the use of same-sex, same-strain mice. Future work using the experimental design reported here should include both male and female mice to address this question further in the spaceflight environment, with and without immunization. The use of inbred mice and a defined immunization schedule over a specified amount of time should allow for reproducibility of the current findings and an expansion of the information gained here in mice of both sexes.Conclusion A 30-day exposure to the spaceflight environment, combined with immunological events, such as vaccination or exposure to a pathogen, can induce inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling in the mouse heart. Protective transcripts are induced in the heart, which reduce oxidative stress associated with inflammatory responses and prevent cardiomyocyte loss. This report lends insight into the cardiovascular response to immune challenges in space and provides a foundation for future studies designed to elucidate whether inflammation in the heart is a transient or chronic effect following vaccination in the spaceflight environment.Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel. Subject terms: Biotechnology, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Biomarkers, Risk factors",
    "introduction": "Introduction Rodent studies demonstrate that spaceflight negatively impacts liver function1–3. Astronaut studies including the seminal NASA Twins Study also reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation4,5. Despite these findings, there has been relatively little research studying the impact of microgravity or space radiation on the liver, with more research emphasis on central nervous system effects and carcinogenesis. This is a key knowledge gap considering the disruption of such a critical organ could impact astronaut health and jeopardize the success of future long-term space missions. Identifying the genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction is required as a first step in precisely mitigating those deleterious effects. Traditional statistical methods identify correlations which may or may not be spurious, especially in high-dimensional, high-throughput data analysis6. While randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for identifying non-spurious, causal relationships between dependent and independent variables7, such experiments can be very expensive and time consuming, or logistically infeasible, especially in a spaceflight environment where sample sizes are limited. Instead, we turn to new machine learning (ML) approaches to identify genes in transcriptomic data predictive of a lipid metabolic response from spaceflight and ground control rodent liver samples. Tools which are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional data, and ML algorithms in general, share an intrinsic flaw. They discover those patterns in data which minimize training error, but training data are often flawed by selection bias, label bias, capture bias, and negative set bias8. Algorithms which train on biased datasets inherit these data biases. Minimizing training error encourages algorithms to indiscriminately absorb all the correlations found in training data, real or spurious. Spurious correlations resulting from data biases are unrelated to the true underlying signal9. Recently, disambiguating true correlations from spurious ones has been studied in the context of causal inference. For this reason, we leverage tools from the causal inference domain to identify genes which are robustly correlated with a phenotype. While such genes are putatively causal, validating true causality is beyond the scope of this research. In this research, we use CRISP—an ensemble machine learning platform developed by the Frontier Development Laboratory (FDL) 2020 Astronaut Health team10 to enhance biological and medical research with heterogeneous and high-dimensional observational data11. The FDL team used CRISP to identify genetic drivers that differentiate two subtypes of colorectal cancer and to implicate operational taxonomic units of the associated microbiome. The algorithms in the CRISP platform are based on the concept of invariance as a proxy for causal inference. Invariance is a property of a feature which reflects how well a classification algorithm performs using that feature to predict a response invariantly; that is, on data which were generated in different environments, under different circumstances, different conditions, or using different interventions12,13. An algorithm based on invariance can identify those features that predict the target label regardless of the background data generating processes that gave rise to the dataset. The classic example is a machine learning classifier built to distinguish images of cows from images of camels14. A machine learning classifier that is overfit to a particular environment may learn that a cow is an animal that lives in green pastures while a camel is an animal that lives in beige deserts. Given a cow on a sandy beach, this classifier would likely call it a camel. By contrast, a classifier based on invariance would be optimized to ignore the background environment and learn the salient features which truly distinguish a cow from a camel, such as the dimensions of the neck and legs and the shape of the face. Classification algorithms which exploit invariance promote learning correlations that are stable across training environments, as these are expected to persist on out-of-distribution data (i.e. data generated in environments not seen by the algorithm during training) and therefore be robustly correlated to and more likely causal of the response variable15. In this research, we leverage several data transformations for augmenting the dataset that additionally provide an environment in which to leverage the CRISP invariance strategy. We use CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a high lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice liver tissue. We establish a binary threshold of lipid density using scalar values associated with oil red O (ORO) stained tissue. To compare our method with traditional differential gene expression tools, we use EdgeR and DESeq2. We also compare our results with those derived from generic machine learning classifiers including random forest and empirical risk minimization. Overall, we find that CRISP identifies a biologically relevant set of genes which are uniquely predictive of a high lipid density response in space-flown mice. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses reveal that the dysfunctional regulation of the genes identified by CRISP is implicated in the spectrum of diseases caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mice in the experiment flight group were only in space for a maximum of 54 days, yet their gene expression profiles were altered significantly enough to manifest markers of NAFLD. NASA has gathered a significant amount of biomedical data on the effect of short-term spaceflight (< 6 months), from the astronauts of the Apollo missions to those who fly on the International Space Station (ISS). What matters now is not merely the impact of being in space, but rather the impact of living there. Surviving long-term spaceflight (> 6 months) is necessary for the success of the planned Artemis and Mars missions16. Our study provides the first machine learning analysis of gene expression predictive of a disease-related response to spaceflight in the liver.",
    "methods": "Methods and data The data we used for our experiment include transcriptomic and histology data from the liver tissue of space-flown and ground-control mice. The overall workflow for our data and methods is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Experiment setup to compare the most predictive genes of space-flown and ground-control murine lipid density from liver tissue RNA-seq data using both traditional (non-causal inference) methods and the CRISP ensemble of causal inference methods. Gene expression data were transformed to augment the data set and then combined into a single matrix. Environment strings were assigned to each sample based on the name of the transformation performed and the RNA-seq library preparation method. Binary labels (0 and 1) were assigned to each sample based on a threshold value of lipid density. We compare which methods (causal or non-causal inference) perform better at identifying the top genes implicated in the lipid density phenotype. NASA open science data repository The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides AI-ready datasets allowing rapid deployment of machine learning algorithms for data mining. This is possible because OSDR is a FAIR database (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)16,17 with rich metadata providing full context for the data and experiments. The full set of metadata for the samples in our experiment is shown in Supplementary Table 1. RNA-seq data This study uses transcriptomic data from four OSDR datasets: OSD-4717 (version 11), OSD-4817 (version 10), OSD-13718 (version 6), and OSD-16817 (version 10). These datasets were generated from three rodent research (RR) missions: RR-1 CASIS, RR-1 NASA, and RR-3. Two different strains of mice were used: C57 and Balb/C. The RR-1 CASIS experiment was designed to study the effects of microgravity of C57 mice on muscle degeneration due to spaceflight (OSD-47). The RR-1 NASA mission was designed to validate the experimental hardware and scientific capabilities on the International Space Station (OSD-48). The RR-3 mission was designed to study countermeasures in Balb/C mice for loss of mass in muscle and bone that have been observed in spaceflight (OSD-137 and OSD-168). The OSD-168 dataset was not based on a separate mission but rather to test the utility of External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) RNA sequencing controls and therefore constitute technical replicates in our experiments. These rodent research missions were originally designed as randomized controlled experiments, with mice randomly assigned to the groups described in Table 1. Table 1. The four experimental groups of mice from the OSDR datasets. Group Description Basal Housed in standard vivarium cages on Earth, euthanized 1 day after launch Vivarium Housed in standard vivarium cages on Earth, euthanized n days after launch Ground Housed in ISS habitat cages on Earth, euthanized n days after launch Flight Housed in ISS habitat cages on ISS, euthanized n days after launch Open in a new tab The basal, vivarium, and ground groups were combined as “non-flight” samples.In our analyses, we consider the mice in the basal, vivarium, and ground experimental groups as “non-flight” and compare them with the flight group. We are re-using these data to explore the relationship between the transcriptomes and a phenotype, constituting the data as observational in our research. Indeed, the causal inference algorithms in the CRISP platform ensemble were designed to run on observational data.Liver histology phenotype data Liver tissues used for gene expression were quantified for lipid density using the oil red O (ORO) staining protocol. ORO is a fat soluble, hydrophobic dye that stains lipid molecules red19. ORO percent positivity was calculated for each sample from the stained images, providing a scalar value that measures the lipid density—higher ORO positivity values directly correspond to higher lipid densities. ORO positivity is the de facto histological biomarker for diagnosing the spectrum of disorders in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) post mortem. Because OSD-168 is comprised of technical replicates, the ORO positivity data are associated with the biological replicates in OSD-47, OSD-48, and OSD-137 and not in OSD-168 itself. Data preparation A typical machine learning pipeline includes a data preprocessing step. At the very least, the data must be prepared to satisfy the assumptions and requirements of the algorithms which use the data. CRISP requires that the features be real-valued, that the target be binary, and that the environment string be ASCII text, as described in the following sections. Binarized target The ORO positivity scalar values in our dataset range from 0.91 to 26.94, but the CRISP platform only permits binary targets (low and high) for classification. We converted the scalar value to a per-mission binary value using the mean value between flight and non-flight medians. The thresholds are depicted in the box-and-whisker plot of Fig. 2 as a horizontal dashed blue line. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Box-and-whisker plots for ORO values (y-axis) based on mission (x-axis). The dashed blue line is the rodent research mission threshold that was calculated as the mean of the two group medians (yellow lines). The 2-sided student t-test p-values show that the differences between the medians of flight and non-flight samples are all significant. The top of each box represents the 75th percentile, the bottom of each box represents the 25th percentile, and the solid black lines on the very top and bottom represent the maxima and minima, respectively.Using the thresholds per mission indicated in Fig. 2, a sample was assigned a binary target of 0 if its ORO positivity is less than the threshold value and 1 if its ORO positivity is greater than or equal to the threshold value.Feature transformations and data augmentation There are many types of transformations, including power-scaling and normalization, that are commonly performed on data as pre-processing steps in a machine learning pipeline. Gonzalez et al.20 and others have shown that while data preprocessing is a necessary step in a machine learning pipeline, there isn’t much agreement as to which is the best. Some data transformations are more volatile than others. A data transformation may change the data so drastically that it destroys some of the underlying signals of interest. This lack of data preprocessing standard exists in transcriptomic data analysis as well21. In our research, instead of choosing one pre-processing method, we used several methods as shown in Table 2. This technique of adding differently transformed samples to a dataset is referred to as data augmentation and is a common practice in machine learning22. Standardization (converting values to z-scores) is a proven method of data harmonization when combining multiple datasets into one dataset23. Each transformation was considered a separate environment across which CRISP must find genes invariantly correlated to the target. We exploit CRISP’s built-in search for invariance across environments and consider each transformation as a perturbation of the data akin to a causal intervention24. Table 2. Description of and reference for each gene expression data transformation used in pre-processing of data. Transformation Description Reference Log scale Scales values to their log base 2 Quinn et al.25 Square root Scales values to their square roots Zhang et al.26 Median of ratios Scales values to account for sequencing depth, gene length, and outliers Robinson et al.27 Centered log ratio Transforms data to eliminate over-dispersion Anders et al.28 Box-Cox Transforms non-normal data into a normal shape Sun et al.29 Z-score Scales values to their number of standard deviations from the mean Zwiener et al.30 Open in a new tab These 5 transformations (log, square root, median of ratios, centered log ratio, and Box-Cox) provide 6 times more data for building the models and create environments in which to leverage invariance for CRISP. The z-scores of each transformation were individually calculated prior to merging the datasets.Figure 3 shows the original data distribution (named “identity”) and the data after having been transformed and plotted as (variance vs mean) coordinates in log scale. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Scatter plots of variance versus mean for different transformations used in preprocessing. The vertical and horizontal axes are shown in log2 scale after having standardized the data. The identity transformation represents the original, untransformed data. The square root (sqrt) transformation computes the square root of each expression value. The normalization (norm) transformation uses the median of ratios method from the R DESeq2 package. The centered log ratio (clr) method divides each row of gene expression data by the mean of that row and returns the logarithms of those ratios. The log transformation computes the logarithm (base 2) of each expression value. The boxcox transformation is a type of power transformation that makes the gene expression data more normally distributed.The mean–variance plots of the differently transformed data in Fig. 3 reveals that certain transformations change the data significantly while other transformations are relatively mild in effect, compared to the original raw data. In addition to these transformations, we applied some basic filtering of the input to remove transcripts which don’t have ENSEMBL identifiers, don’t code for a protein, have counts of 0 in 80% or more of the samples, have a coefficient of variation less than 0.1, or have counts less than 50 in 80% or more of the samples, as shown in Supplementary Table 6. This filtering produced the final set of 8,092 genes which we subsequently used in all downstream analysis. To prevent data leakage, we first separated the data into training, validation, and test datasets and standardized the training and validation sets separately31. We held out 90% of the raw data for testing and did not perform any transformations on it32. We held out 10% of the raw data for validation, and we used all the augmented data during the training phase.Technical batch effects We examined the dataset for batch effects and found that only the type of library preparation of the RNA-seq experiments generating the transcriptomic data clearly separate the samples, as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab PCA plots of OSD datasets colorized by the different covariates, including (a) library preparation, (b) dataset, (c) experimental group, (d) mouse strain, and (e) Rodent Research study. The first two principal components capture 92% of the total variance of the gene expression. Colorizing by library preparation in Fig. 4a shows a distinct separation of all samples.Unlike Fig. 4a (library preparation), Fig. 4b–e do not show a clean separation of samples colored by covariate. To account for this library preparation batch effect, we include the library preparation in the environment string, as discussed in the following section.Constructing the environment string CRISP defines the environments of each sample by associating with it an environment string value. Different values of this string represent known perturbations in the data generating process for that sample. In our experiment, the two known perturbations of the data include the library preparation and the data transformation. Because the other covariates do not cluster in the PCA plot, we conclude they do not create a batch effect and therefore are not included in the environment string. Causal inference algorithms which exploit environment invariance theoretically perform better on out-of-distribution data when the number of environments used to train the model is high12. However, if the number of samples in the dataset is small (which is intrinsic to transcriptomic experiments), then the environment string must be selected such that there are enough samples in each partition to test for significance. Therefore, we restricted our choice of environment string to include only known perturbations of the data—i.e. transformation and library preparation—and excluded perturbations of unknown effect such as study and group. We show results using strain in the environment string in Supplemental Figs. 4 and 5. Table 3 shows a snippet of one fictitious sample’s input data after having performed the 5 data transformations and the standardization. The identity transformation is the original data, standardized. The environment string (here, called “env”) is a concatenation of the sample library preparation (here, “polyA”) and the transformation name (e.g. “boxcox”). Only the binary ORO threshold (called “oro_thresh”) for the sample remains unchanged across the same sample as well as for its respective technical replicates of OSD-168, if they exist. As a result of performing these 5 data transformations, our combined dataset size of 51 samples was increased six-fold to 306 samples. Table 3.

The binary ORO threshold (“oro_thresh”) is set to either 0 (low ORO positivity) or 1 (high ORO positivity). Running CRISP experiments With the data in place, we turn now to how we run the CRISP in silico experiments. CRISP ensemble methods CRISP is an ensemble of machine learning methods which have been designed to identify features causal of a target11. We leveraged CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a phenotype. There are 2 types of algorithms in CRISP: one based on invariant causal prediction (ICP)13; and one based on invariant risk minimization (IRM)12. There is a linear and non-linear version of each of these algorithms. The linear versions use linear combinations of the feature space to construct a binary output, and the non-linear versions use non-linear combinations (multi-layer perceptrons with non-linear activation functions) of the feature space to construct a binary output. Both algorithms rely on invariance as a proxy for causality, and invariance in turn relies on having data partitioned by known interventions or perturbations. Each of these methods trains a model using a training set, selects model hyper-parameters using a validation set, and provides a final model accuracy on a held-out test set. CRISP partitions the data into different environments such that the model is trained on data from one environment and then validated and tested on the data from the other environments. CRISP uses two methods of feature reduction to reduce the number of variables to search. The first method removes features whose correlation to the target is below a certain threshold, and the second method uses a multi-layer perceptron to identify the most salient features based on model feature importance.CRISP configuration CRISP experiments are configured with several parameters in a JSON configuration file. By default, the test_val_split parameter defines how much data to dedicate for training, testing, and validation. We overrode this default data splitting configuration and explicitly defined the training, testing, and validation data subsets. The training data is used to train the model parameters, the validation data is used to select the optimal set of model hyperparameters, and the test data is held out after the model is trained and validated to report accuracy. It is this held-out test accuracy that we subsequently report on. The max_features parameter defines the number of features each model in the ensemble should find as most predictive of the target. We used the default value of 20 in our CRISP experiment. The data_options parameter defines the file location containing the dataset, which columns in that dataset are to be used as predictors, which column is the environment variable, and which column is the target variable. There are several other parameters that may be configured in this JSON configuration file which get consumed by the machine learning algorithms configured in the ensemble. The JSON configuration we used in our experiment is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.CRISP ensemble voting CRISP is an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. Ensembles are used to combine a set of multiple “weak” learners into a single “strong” learner to minimize training errors33. Each model in the ensemble is trained on the dataset to identify the features most predictive of the target. After training, each model selects the features (20 by default) which it found as most predictive of the target. For the linear models—linear invariant risk minimization (linear IRM) and linear invariant causal prediction (linear ICP)—the features which are most predictive are those whose coefficients of the linear model have the highest absolute values. For non-linear models—non-linear invariant risk minimization (non-linear IRM) and non-linear invariant causal prediction (non-linear ICP)—the most predictive features are selected through sensitivity analysis (the features which have the highest impact on the response variable). After each model has selected its top-most predictive features, the ensemble votes to elect a single set of (by default, 20) features to present as the final result of the experiment. Non-Causal Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and random forest (RF) are not causal predictors and do not participate in CRISP’s selection of the features. Non-causal ERM relies on statistical minimization of risk or error, while RF is another non-causal method which combines decision trees for a classification result. They are included in the experiment only as a basis of comparison to the causal predictors (non-linear IRM, linear ICP, non-linear ICP, and linear IRM). CRISP attributes the highest weight to the feature that the highest accuracy model gives the largest coefficient (or highest sensitivity). Conversely, the lowest ranking feature from the worst performing model will be attributed the lowest weight. Furthermore, the higher degree of concordance across the ensemble (i.e. how many models found the feature in their top 20 list), the higher the weighted coefficient of that feature. This attribution weight w(k) of feature k is calculated as shown in the following equation. The values pk represent the fraction of models which found this feature k in its list of top (by default, 20) features. The number M is the number of models CRISP is configured to use. The values sm(k) are the absolute values of the linear coefficients (for linear models) or sensitivity factors (for non-linear models) scaled to the unit interval. The values am are the predictive accuracies of the models. In this way, CRISP identifies those features that are most predictive of the target from the highest number of best performing models.CRISP results on synthetic data To help validate whether CRISP is truly identifying features robustly correlated to the target, we ran an experiment in which we synthetically generated a feature space with a known causal relationship to a target using structural equation modeling. Of the 6 known causal features, the CRISP ensemble found 5 of them in its list of top 20 features, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. The probability of this happening at random is 0.00124 as shown in Supplementary Eq. 1. By contrast, the RF and ERM classifiers didn’t find any of the 6 causal features in their top 20 list. This is further evidence that CRISP can distinguish robustly correlated features from uncorrelated ones.CRISP updates Accompanying this paper we publish a CRISPv1.1 code release, with the following updates. First, we updated the linear IRM code to output continuous feature weights such that the coefficients are now on the unit interval [0, 1]. We create confusion matrices for the test results and append them to the results so that we can calculate sensitivity, specificity, and F-1 scores. We changed the default batch size from 128 to 8 to improve accuracy. We updated the configuration to provide a means to override the default method used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Last, we updated the post-processing step by putting their feature coefficients on the scale of z-scores.",
    "results": "Results In this section, we show the results of the CRISP experiment. We validate our findings using pathway analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), and a search of relevant literature. We show the results of the gene expression analysis using DESeq2 and EdgeR to compare the CRISP results with commonly used bioinformatic tools. CRISP results Each of the models in the ensemble trains on the same data set to identify the features which best predict the target across all environments. Figure 5 depicts the confusion matrices and performance metrics for each model in the ensemble. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab (a–g) Show confusion matrices and (h) shows performance metrics for each model in the CRISP ensemble. The horizontal rows are the actual classes, and the vertical columns are the predicted classes. We assigned the low lipid density class (0) to “positive” and the high lipid density class (1) to “negative” for the purpose of calculating precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision and F1-score values are undefined for the linear ICP model because it did not predict any positive classes, as shown in (d). The higher the accuracy of the model, the higher the weight associated with the results of that model in the ensemble.The best and worst accuracies in the experiment do not participate in the ensemble vote. The RF test accuracy was the best out of all the models, scoring a 100% accuracy rate (and therefore perfect precision, recall, and F1-score). Conversely, ERM accuracy was the lowest. Non-linear ICP has 89% test accuracy and therefore contributes the most to the ensemble results. Conversely, linear IRM performed the worst across the ensemble (58% test accuracy) and therefore contributes the least to the ensemble results. The linear ICP algorithm did not predict any samples to have a low lipid density, so its precision and F1-scores are undefined. The bar chart in Fig. 6 shows the degree to which each gene across the ensemble is predictive of the lipid density response variable. Based on Fig. 6, we see that the Mup11 gene was found in the top 20 genes most predictive of lipid density in all 5 models. By contrast, the Fasn gene was found in the top 20 genes most predictive of lipid density in only 3 of the models. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab The weight of the top 20 genes and their degree of concordance across the ensemble. The direction of the bar indicates whether the gene expression is predictive of high or low lipid density. Each bar is colored by the number of models which found that gene in their list of the top 20 most predictive genes.The biological functions of the 20 CRISP genes are shown in Table 4. The functions were derived from the information provided in the  Gene tool at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/. Table 4.

Validation using gene set enrichment analysis We used the 20 genes from the CRISP experiment to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp) using the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) ontology gene sets (C5) collection version v2023.2.Mm. This tool finds those gene ontologies from all ontology gene sets (GO: Gene Ontology and HPO: Human Phenotype Ontology) that have a significant overlap with the query gene set in the mouse genome. Table 5 shows the top gene sets in the C5 collection that significantly overlap with these 20 mouse genes. Table 5.

These gene sets are consistent with our lipid density phenotype as they are involved in the metabolism of fats, and we will explore the scientific literature to determine how these genes are implicated in NAFLD in the “Validation from scientific literature” section.Validation using pathway analysis We submitted the 20 genes resulting from our CRISP experiment, and as background all 8,092 genes which were used in our CRISP experiment, to the KEGG pathway34 of the ShinyGO 0.80 pathway analysis tool (https://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/). This tool finds the Gene Ontology pathways which overlap with the query gene set as compared to the background gene set. Table 6 shows the enriched pathway that ShinyGO identified. Table 6. Enriched gene ontology pathways involving the genes from the CRISP experiment.

This fold enrichment is then used to provide an enrichment false discovery rate (FDR), all of which are below our 0.05 threshold of significance.Using the enrichment false discovery rate metric of significance, the significant pathways relating to our gene set include cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and alcoholic liver disease. Cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism are consistent with both our gene set enrichment analysis as well as our lipid density phenotype. Lipid dysregulation is a key factor of fatty liver disease: the accumulation of lipids creates a lipotoxic environment that can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and liver damage. The genes enriching these 3 pathways include Apoe, Star, Apoc3, Apoc1, Fasn, Scd1, and Cyp2e1. We will explore the scientific literature to determine how these genes are implicated in NAFLD in the “Validation from scientific literature” section.Validation from SPOKE The Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) is a massive knowledge graph of biomedical information which may be leveraged for a variety of purposes from drug discovery to disease diagnosis35. We used SPOKEv5 to identify disease conditions (derived from the Disease Ontology Knowledgebase36) from the list of 20 genes that CRISP found. Table 7 identifies those disease conditions and their associated adjusted p-value. Table 7. Disease ontologies and associated Bonferroni-corrected p-values. Disease ontology Adjusted p-value Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (DOID: 0080208) < 0.001 Lipid storage disease (DOID:9455) < 0.001 Steatotic liver disease (DOID:9452) 0.001 Disease of metabolism (DOID: 0014667) 0.001 Open in a new tab All the disease ontology identifiers (DOID) that SPOKE found as statistically significantly associated with the CRISP result gene set are related to dysfunctional lipid metabolism.All these statistically significant disease ontologies are consistent with a high lipid density phenotype and NAFLD. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the more recent term used for NAFLD.Validation from scientific literature Table 8 shows one relatively recent and relevant research article that discusses the relationship of NAFLD to each of the CRISP genes which enrich the pathways and gene sets previously discussed.

Fuior et al. discuss how the overexpression of Apoc1 in mice may lead to hyperlipidemia. Lu et al. demonstrated that overexpression of Apoc3 manifests in features similar to NAFLD, including increased hepatic lipid content. Harjumaki et al. discuss the role of Cyp2e1 in the development of NASH which is a precursor condition to NAFLD, suggesting that the over-expression of the Cyp2e1 enzyme and subsequent oxidative stress is sufficient to induce hepatic lipid accumulation. Woolsey et al. found that hepatic mRNA expression of Cyp3a41b in NASH was 69% lower than control livers. Testing its pharmacological inhibition in human cell culture, O’Farrell et al. consider Fasn to be a promising therapeutic target for NASH as they observed that its reduced expression reduced overall triglyceride content, markers of fibrosis and inflammation, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The Gamt gene encodes an enzyme which helps synthesize creatine, and Marinello et al. found that its supplementation has been demonstrated to prevent NAFLD progression. Qin et al. describe how aberrant transcriptional activation of Scd1 causes excessive lipid accumulation and promotes progression of NAFLD (among other metabolic complications), making it a promising therapeutic target. Finally, Qiu et al. found that Star overexpression, among other protective roles, can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation—suggesting it may be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD. Comparing CRISP results to other analyses In this section, we compare the results of our CRISP experiments with other tools which associate features with targets including DESeq2, random forest, and empirical risk minimization. Comparing results from CRISP and DESeq2 We used DESeq2 version 1.34.0 to perform differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) on the data on the same set of genes as we used in CRISP to identify which genes are significantly differentially expressed between the high and low ORO groups. DESeq2 performs its own filtering and normalization steps, so we did not transform the data. Because of the distinct batch effect due to library preparation, we added the library preparation covariate to the column data and included it in the DESeq2 design formula along with the ORO threshold value. DESeq2 did not find any genes that were significantly differentially expressed when setting the Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value cutoff to 0.05.Comparing results from CRISP and EdgeR We used EdgeR version 3.36.0 to perform DGEA on the data on the same set of genes as we used in CRISP to identify which genes are significantly differentially expressed between the high and low ORO groups. EdgeR performs its own filtering and normalization steps, so we did not transform the data. Because of the distinct batch effect due to library preparation, we added the library preparation covariate to the column data and included it in the EdgeR design formula along with the ORO threshold value. Table 9 shows the 6 differentially expressed genes from the EdgeR experiment using 0.05 as the Bonferroni adjusted p-value threshold and not using a log2 fold change threshold. Table 9. Gene result set using EdgeR to find differentially expressed genes between low and high ORO groups. Gene Function Atp1a2 Integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane Des This gene encodes a muscle-specific class III intermediate filament.

Acts upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process; glucocorticoid metabolic process; and regulation of steroid biosynthetic process Akr1b7 Predicted to act upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process Open in a new tab Half of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism (Akr1b7, Tpm2, and Star).Submitting these genes to the GSEA tool, we see that these genes are implicated in hyperplasia, abnormal myocardium morphology, reduced systolic function, weakness of facial musculature, and areflexia (shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The ShinyGO tool finds several pathways overlapping these 6 genes, from cardiomyopathy to ovarian steroidogenesis, folate biosynthesis, cortisol synthesis and secretion, thyroid hormone synthesis, pancreatic secretion, cardiomyopathy, Cushing Syndrome, and various metabolic pathways including galactose, cholesterol, fructose, and lipid metabolism. Given such a wide range of pathways and gene sets that affect so many different organs and pathologies, it is not at all clear what, if any, conclusions could be drawn from the EdgeR gene result set.Statistical analysis of gene distributions Taken together, the genes enriched in the pathways and gene sets shown in Tables 5 and 6 include Alg5, Apoc1, Apoc3, Apoe, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a41b, Fasn, Gamt, Scd1, and Star. Figure 7 shows the box-and-whisker plots of the distributions of the raw counts of gene expression for each of these 10 genes between the flight samples and non-flight samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Box-and-whisker plots of the distributions of gene expression for each of the genes with associated Wilcoxon p-values comparing flight and non-flight groups. Several p-values are not statistically significant, suggesting that only using statistics to analyze differences in gene expression between groups may not be sufficient.As indicated in Fig. 7, not all the differences between flight and non-flight lipid densities are statistically significant. This suggests that using statistics alone to identify genes predictive of a response may be insufficient in some circumstances. Indeed, the CRISP platform is intended to complement current approaches which rely heavily, if not entirely, on statistical methods.Analyzing results from CRISP when using non-augmented data Running CRISP without data augmentation (i.e. using the original gene expression of the n = 51 samples and using only library preparation in the environment string), CRISP identified the genes in Supplementary Fig. 7 as most predictive of the phenotype. However, pathway enrichment analysis on these 20 genes reveals a long list of pathways, not all of which are related to the phenotype (e.g. hormone synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and coronavirus disease). We attribute this result to the lack of training data, poor model performance, and insufficient exploitation of invariance in the CRISP experiment.Analyzing results from CRISP when using other environment strings We include Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 to show the CRISP results and model performance when using group in the environment variable rather than library preparation. Because the mean lipid density is significantly different between flight and non-flight groups, we expected the accuracy to be higher in the CRISP models predicting the lipid density response when using the group (flight vs non-flight) in the environment variable rather than library preparation. However, the performance of the ensemble was not as good, and the downstream analyses were inconsistent with respect to liver metabolism. We attribute this to the fact that while the metabolic response to spaceflight in the liver was statistically significantly different than ground control, the gene expression data between the 2 groups does not separate in the PCA plot, as shown in Fig. 4c. We include Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 to show the CRISP results and model performance when using strain in the environment variable rather than library preparation. We observe that while the CRISP experiments have 50% concordance in their gene sets, using library preparation as the environment variable yields more biologically specific and plausible results. The gene ontologies and pathways enriched by the genes that CRISP found when using strain in the environment variable are not uniformly related to lipid metabolism and include pathways such as cardiomyopathy and thyroid hormone synthesis.Analyzing results from the random forest classifier CRISP includes non-causal algorithms in its ensemble to compare results with causal algorithms. While random forest lays no claim to identify features causal of a target, the algorithm is one of the best-performing and highly used ML classification algorithms37. The CRISP ensemble uses the RandomForestClassifier module from version 0.24.2 of the scikit-learn package. Like its causal counterparts, the random forest algorithm calculates a feature importance metric which can be used to define confidence in the results. Among the top 20 genes that random forest identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to the  Gene tool. Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the random forest classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response. The 20 genes which random forest found as most predictive of the lipid density phenotype are shown in Supplementary Table 4.Analyzing results from empirical risk minimization Following the same analysis as with random forest, here we analyze the results from empirical risk minimization (ERM). ERM uses the canonical minimization of the sum of the squares of the residuals as its unconditional objective function. It does not partition the data into environments like IRM. As such, it is perhaps the closest comparison to the linear IRM and non-linear IRM results from CRISP. Among the 20 genes that ERM identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to . Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the ERM classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response. The 20 genes which ERM found as most predictive of the lipid density phenotype are shown in Supplementary Table 5.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The CRISP platform trains an ensemble of binary classifiers on data in one environment and validates and tests them using the data from the other environments. Separating the environments in this way ensures that the ensemble algorithms are rewarded for finding correlations that are independent of biases in the data generating processes. Classifying data independently of the environment is the definition of invariance in this context and leads to more robustly correlated results. Using the CRISP ensemble, we’ve identified a set of genes which are predictive of high and low lipid density. These genes are significantly associated with gene sets and genetic pathways that are consistent with NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction. On the other hand, machine learning methods such as empirical risk minimization and random forest do not distinguish between spurious and non-spurious correlations. In our experiment, their top 20 genes are not biologically related to lipid metabolism, despite the random forest classifier having the highest held-out test accuracy (100%) of all the models in predicting lipid density. The DESeq2 package did not find any genes significantly correlated to our phenotype. The EdgeR package found 6 genes whose expression was significantly correlated to the lipid density response variable—one of which (Star) was also found by CRISP. However, gene set enrichment and pathway analysis tools found a wide variety of conditions and processes associated with these 6 genes, leaving the results difficult to interpret. We attribute these quantitative and qualitative differences in results to the environment invariance modeling approach that the CRISP ML algorithms use in conjunction with the data augmentation methods we leveraged. As opposed to the non-specific pathways enriched by the EdgeR genes, the CRISP genes enrich lipid metabolism pathways including cholesterol, fatty acid, and NAFLD pathways—all of which are consistent with using lipid density as a response in our machine learning models. The NAFLD pathway is significantly enriched by the CRISP gene result set and includes Cyp2e1, Fasn, and Scd1 genes with a 0.014 strength of association, as shown in Table 6. As noted in Table 8, the literature is consistent in finding these genes implicated in experiments on NAFLD. Moreover, the SPOKE knowledge graph found MASLD (the new name for NAFLD) to be the most significantly associated disease ontology with the CRISP gene result set. The use of data augmentation in this CRISP experiment is crucial. Not only does augmentation provide known perturbations of the data as required by CRISP, data augmentation also provides more samples to train, test, and validate the ensemble of machine learning classifiers. Even so, having more samples than 51 would enrich the underlying gene expression signals which would lead to even more robust correlations. We therefore recommend future spaceflight experiments to increase the cohort size and make the liver a standard tissue to collect, process, and analyze. We acknowledge a caveat that the OSD-137 study used the Balb/c mouse strain, while the other three studies used the C57BL6 strain. These two mouse strains are known to have differing responses to spaceflight5. Thus, a future study would benefit from further investigating the responses of the different mouse strains in larger cohorts. To further validate our findings, one could explore other data associated with these same rodents including proteomic and methylation data, as well as leverage existing molecular tests of liver function. A future analysis of the gene expression of ground models of NAFLD may help validate the genes identified here by CRISP. Future work could focus on randomized controlled experiments specifically designed to manipulate the function of each putative gene to verify they do, in fact, cause high or low lipid density in liver tissue. For example, reverse transcriptase PCR or quantitative immunohistochemistry studies on liver samples from controlled experiments could provide key validation results. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) related to fatty liver, steatosis, and NAFLD could be explored to identify the molecular pathways responsible for the lipid density phenotype and to gain a more complete purview of the putative dysfunction. Additionally, to further elucidate a link to human manifestation of NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction, it will be important to address the species differences between mouse and human. In this research, we provide a novel approach to identify potentially causal genes associated with liver dysfunction during spaceflight. These genes constitute potential biomarkers of NAFLD for targeted monitoring or therapeutics development in the future that would otherwise be more time consuming or impossible to identify with traditional statistical or experimental approaches. Given the expense of randomized controlled experiments, having a targeted set of genes putatively causal of the response is invaluable. While the results of our research link the expression of certain genes to a lipid dysregulation phenotype in liver tissue, our approach can be generalized to other tissues, phenotypes, and even other -omics data. For NASA to embark on longer and more frequent space missions, understanding the impact of spaceflight on biological function is paramount. To this end, there are many data sets in OSDR left to explore, and more are continuing to be published.",

Copyright notice ID: 11748630 PMID: 39824847 Abstract Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel. Subject terms: Biotechnology, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Biomarkers, Risk factorsIntroduction Rodent studies demonstrate that spaceflight negatively impacts liver function1–3. Astronaut studies including the seminal NASA Twins Study also reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation4,5. Despite these findings, there has been relatively little research studying the impact of microgravity or space radiation on the liver, with more research emphasis on central nervous system effects and carcinogenesis. This is a key knowledge gap considering the disruption of such a critical organ could impact astronaut health and jeopardize the success of future long-term space missions. Identifying the genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction is required as a first step in precisely mitigating those deleterious effects. Traditional statistical methods identify correlations which may or may not be spurious, especially in high-dimensional, high-throughput data analysis6. While randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for identifying non-spurious, causal relationships between dependent and independent variables7, such experiments can be very expensive and time consuming, or logistically infeasible, especially in a spaceflight environment where sample sizes are limited. Instead, we turn to new machine learning (ML) approaches to identify genes in transcriptomic data predictive of a lipid metabolic response from spaceflight and ground control rodent liver samples. Tools which are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional data, and ML algorithms in general, share an intrinsic flaw. They discover those patterns in data which minimize training error, but training data are often flawed by selection bias, label bias, capture bias, and negative set bias8. Algorithms which train on biased datasets inherit these data biases. Minimizing training error encourages algorithms to indiscriminately absorb all the correlations found in training data, real or spurious. Spurious correlations resulting from data biases are unrelated to the true underlying signal9. Recently, disambiguating true correlations from spurious ones has been studied in the context of causal inference. For this reason, we leverage tools from the causal inference domain to identify genes which are robustly correlated with a phenotype. While such genes are putatively causal, validating true causality is beyond the scope of this research. In this research, we use CRISP—an ensemble machine learning platform developed by the Frontier Development Laboratory (FDL) 2020 Astronaut Health team10 to enhance biological and medical research with heterogeneous and high-dimensional observational data11. The FDL team used CRISP to identify genetic drivers that differentiate two subtypes of colorectal cancer and to implicate operational taxonomic units of the associated microbiome. The algorithms in the CRISP platform are based on the concept of invariance as a proxy for causal inference. Invariance is a property of a feature which reflects how well a classification algorithm performs using that feature to predict a response invariantly; that is, on data which were generated in different environments, under different circumstances, different conditions, or using different interventions12,13. An algorithm based on invariance can identify those features that predict the target label regardless of the background data generating processes that gave rise to the dataset. The classic example is a machine learning classifier built to distinguish images of cows from images of camels14. A machine learning classifier that is overfit to a particular environment may learn that a cow is an animal that lives in green pastures while a camel is an animal that lives in beige deserts. Given a cow on a sandy beach, this classifier would likely call it a camel. By contrast, a classifier based on invariance would be optimized to ignore the background environment and learn the salient features which truly distinguish a cow from a camel, such as the dimensions of the neck and legs and the shape of the face. Classification algorithms which exploit invariance promote learning correlations that are stable across training environments, as these are expected to persist on out-of-distribution data (i.e. data generated in environments not seen by the algorithm during training) and therefore be robustly correlated to and more likely causal of the response variable15. In this research, we leverage several data transformations for augmenting the dataset that additionally provide an environment in which to leverage the CRISP invariance strategy. We use CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a high lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice liver tissue. We establish a binary threshold of lipid density using scalar values associated with oil red O (ORO) stained tissue. To compare our method with traditional differential gene expression tools, we use EdgeR and DESeq2. We also compare our results with those derived from generic machine learning classifiers including random forest and empirical risk minimization. Overall, we find that CRISP identifies a biologically relevant set of genes which are uniquely predictive of a high lipid density response in space-flown mice. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses reveal that the dysfunctional regulation of the genes identified by CRISP is implicated in the spectrum of diseases caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mice in the experiment flight group were only in space for a maximum of 54 days, yet their gene expression profiles were altered significantly enough to manifest markers of NAFLD. NASA has gathered a significant amount of biomedical data on the effect of short-term spaceflight (< 6 months), from the astronauts of the Apollo missions to those who fly on the International Space Station (ISS). What matters now is not merely the impact of being in space, but rather the impact of living there. Surviving long-term spaceflight (> 6 months) is necessary for the success of the planned Artemis and Mars missions16. Our study provides the first machine learning analysis of gene expression predictive of a disease-related response to spaceflight in the liver.Methods and data The data we used for our experiment include transcriptomic and histology data from the liver tissue of space-flown and ground-control mice. The overall workflow for our data and methods is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Experiment setup to compare the most predictive genes of space-flown and ground-control murine lipid density from liver tissue RNA-seq data using both traditional (non-causal inference) methods and the CRISP ensemble of causal inference methods. Gene expression data were transformed to augment the data set and then combined into a single matrix. Environment strings were assigned to each sample based on the name of the transformation performed and the RNA-seq library preparation method. Binary labels (0 and 1) were assigned to each sample based on a threshold value of lipid density. We compare which methods (causal or non-causal inference) perform better at identifying the top genes implicated in the lipid density phenotype.NASA open science data repository The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides AI-ready datasets allowing rapid deployment of machine learning algorithms for data mining. This is possible because OSDR is a FAIR database (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)16,17 with rich metadata providing full context for the data and experiments. The full set of metadata for the samples in our experiment is shown in Supplementary Table 1. RNA-seq data This study uses transcriptomic data from four OSDR datasets: OSD-4717 (version 11), OSD-4817 (version 10), OSD-13718 (version 6), and OSD-16817 (version 10). These datasets were generated from three rodent research (RR) missions: RR-1 CASIS, RR-1 NASA, and RR-3. Two different strains of mice were used: C57 and Balb/C. The RR-1 CASIS experiment was designed to study the effects of microgravity of C57 mice on muscle degeneration due to spaceflight (OSD-47). The RR-1 NASA mission was designed to validate the experimental hardware and scientific capabilities on the International Space Station (OSD-48). The RR-3 mission was designed to study countermeasures in Balb/C mice for loss of mass in muscle and bone that have been observed in spaceflight (OSD-137 and OSD-168). The OSD-168 dataset was not based on a separate mission but rather to test the utility of External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) RNA sequencing controls and therefore constitute technical replicates in our experiments. These rodent research missions were originally designed as randomized controlled experiments, with mice randomly assigned to the groups described in Table 1. Table 1. The four experimental groups of mice from the OSDR datasets. Group Description Basal Housed in standard vivarium cages on Earth, euthanized 1 day after launch Vivarium Housed in standard vivarium cages on Earth, euthanized n days after launch Ground Housed in ISS habitat cages on Earth, euthanized n days after launch Flight Housed in ISS habitat cages on ISS, euthanized n days after launch Open in a new tab The basal, vivarium, and ground groups were combined as “non-flight” samples.In our analyses, we consider the mice in the basal, vivarium, and ground experimental groups as “non-flight” and compare them with the flight group. We are re-using these data to explore the relationship between the transcriptomes and a phenotype, constituting the data as observational in our research. Indeed, the causal inference algorithms in the CRISP platform ensemble were designed to run on observational data.Liver histology phenotype data Liver tissues used for gene expression were quantified for lipid density using the oil red O (ORO) staining protocol. ORO is a fat soluble, hydrophobic dye that stains lipid molecules red19. ORO percent positivity was calculated for each sample from the stained images, providing a scalar value that measures the lipid density—higher ORO positivity values directly correspond to higher lipid densities. ORO positivity is the de facto histological biomarker for diagnosing the spectrum of disorders in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) post mortem. Because OSD-168 is comprised of technical replicates, the ORO positivity data are associated with the biological replicates in OSD-47, OSD-48, and OSD-137 and not in OSD-168 itself.Data preparation A typical machine learning pipeline includes a data preprocessing step. At the very least, the data must be prepared to satisfy the assumptions and requirements of the algorithms which use the data. CRISP requires that the features be real-valued, that the target be binary, and that the environment string be ASCII text, as described in the following sections. Binarized target The ORO positivity scalar values in our dataset range from 0.91 to 26.94, but the CRISP platform only permits binary targets (low and high) for classification. We converted the scalar value to a per-mission binary value using the mean value between flight and non-flight medians. The thresholds are depicted in the box-and-whisker plot of Fig. 2 as a horizontal dashed blue line. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Box-and-whisker plots for ORO values (y-axis) based on mission (x-axis). The dashed blue line is the rodent research mission threshold that was calculated as the mean of the two group medians (yellow lines). The 2-sided student t-test p-values show that the differences between the medians of flight and non-flight samples are all significant. The top of each box represents the 75th percentile, the bottom of each box represents the 25th percentile, and the solid black lines on the very top and bottom represent the maxima and minima, respectively.Using the thresholds per mission indicated in Fig. 2, a sample was assigned a binary target of 0 if its ORO positivity is less than the threshold value and 1 if its ORO positivity is greater than or equal to the threshold value.Feature transformations and data augmentation There are many types of transformations, including power-scaling and normalization, that are commonly performed on data as pre-processing steps in a machine learning pipeline. Gonzalez et al.20 and others have shown that while data preprocessing is a necessary step in a machine learning pipeline, there isn’t much agreement as to which is the best. Some data transformations are more volatile than others. A data transformation may change the data so drastically that it destroys some of the underlying signals of interest. This lack of data preprocessing standard exists in transcriptomic data analysis as well21. In our research, instead of choosing one pre-processing method, we used several methods as shown in Table 2. This technique of adding differently transformed samples to a dataset is referred to as data augmentation and is a common practice in machine learning22. Standardization (converting values to z-scores) is a proven method of data harmonization when combining multiple datasets into one dataset23. Each transformation was considered a separate environment across which CRISP must find genes invariantly correlated to the target. We exploit CRISP’s built-in search for invariance across environments and consider each transformation as a perturbation of the data akin to a causal intervention24. Table 2. Description of and reference for each gene expression data transformation used in pre-processing of data. Transformation Description Reference Log scale Scales values to their log base 2 Quinn et al.25 Square root Scales values to their square roots Zhang et al.26 Median of ratios Scales values to account for sequencing depth, gene length, and outliers Robinson et al.27 Centered log ratio Transforms data to eliminate over-dispersion Anders et al.28 Box-Cox Transforms non-normal data into a normal shape Sun et al.29 Z-score Scales values to their number of standard deviations from the mean Zwiener et al.30 Open in a new tab These 5 transformations (log, square root, median of ratios, centered log ratio, and Box-Cox) provide 6 times more data for building the models and create environments in which to leverage invariance for CRISP. The z-scores of each transformation were individually calculated prior to merging the datasets.Figure 3 shows the original data distribution (named “identity”) and the data after having been transformed and plotted as (variance vs mean) coordinates in log scale. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Scatter plots of variance versus mean for different transformations used in preprocessing. The vertical and horizontal axes are shown in log2 scale after having standardized the data. The identity transformation represents the original, untransformed data. The square root (sqrt) transformation computes the square root of each expression value. The normalization (norm) transformation uses the median of ratios method from the R DESeq2 package. The centered log ratio (clr) method divides each row of gene expression data by the mean of that row and returns the logarithms of those ratios. The log transformation computes the logarithm (base 2) of each expression value. The boxcox transformation is a type of power transformation that makes the gene expression data more normally distributed.The mean–variance plots of the differently transformed data in Fig. 3 reveals that certain transformations change the data significantly while other transformations are relatively mild in effect, compared to the original raw data. In addition to these transformations, we applied some basic filtering of the input to remove transcripts which don’t have ENSEMBL identifiers, don’t code for a protein, have counts of 0 in 80% or more of the samples, have a coefficient of variation less than 0.1, or have counts less than 50 in 80% or more of the samples, as shown in Supplementary Table 6. This filtering produced the final set of 8,092 genes which we subsequently used in all downstream analysis. To prevent data leakage, we first separated the data into training, validation, and test datasets and standardized the training and validation sets separately31. We held out 90% of the raw data for testing and did not perform any transformations on it32. We held out 10% of the raw data for validation, and we used all the augmented data during the training phase.Technical batch effects We examined the dataset for batch effects and found that only the type of library preparation of the RNA-seq experiments generating the transcriptomic data clearly separate the samples, as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab PCA plots of OSD datasets colorized by the different covariates, including (a) library preparation, (b) dataset, (c) experimental group, (d) mouse strain, and (e) Rodent Research study. The first two principal components capture 92% of the total variance of the gene expression. Colorizing by library preparation in Fig. 4a shows a distinct separation of all samples.Unlike Fig. 4a (library preparation), Fig. 4b–e do not show a clean separation of samples colored by covariate. To account for this library preparation batch effect, we include the library preparation in the environment string, as discussed in the following section.Constructing the environment string CRISP defines the environments of each sample by associating with it an environment string value. Different values of this string represent known perturbations in the data generating process for that sample. In our experiment, the two known perturbations of the data include the library preparation and the data transformation. Because the other covariates do not cluster in the PCA plot, we conclude they do not create a batch effect and therefore are not included in the environment string. Causal inference algorithms which exploit environment invariance theoretically perform better on out-of-distribution data when the number of environments used to train the model is high12. However, if the number of samples in the dataset is small (which is intrinsic to transcriptomic experiments), then the environment string must be selected such that there are enough samples in each partition to test for significance. Therefore, we restricted our choice of environment string to include only known perturbations of the data—i.e. transformation and library preparation—and excluded perturbations of unknown effect such as study and group. We show results using strain in the environment string in Supplemental Figs. 4 and 5. Table 3 shows a snippet of one fictitious sample’s input data after having performed the 5 data transformations and the standardization. The identity transformation is the original data, standardized. The environment string (here, called “env”) is a concatenation of the sample library preparation (here, “polyA”) and the transformation name (e.g. “boxcox”). Only the binary ORO threshold (called “oro_thresh”) for the sample remains unchanged across the same sample as well as for its respective technical replicates of OSD-168, if they exist. As a result of performing these 5 data transformations, our combined dataset size of 51 samples was increased six-fold to 306 samples. Table 3.

The binary ORO threshold (“oro_thresh”) is set to either 0 (low ORO positivity) or 1 (high ORO positivity).Running CRISP experiments With the data in place, we turn now to how we run the CRISP in silico experiments. CRISP ensemble methods CRISP is an ensemble of machine learning methods which have been designed to identify features causal of a target11. We leveraged CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a phenotype. There are 2 types of algorithms in CRISP: one based on invariant causal prediction (ICP)13; and one based on invariant risk minimization (IRM)12. There is a linear and non-linear version of each of these algorithms. The linear versions use linear combinations of the feature space to construct a binary output, and the non-linear versions use non-linear combinations (multi-layer perceptrons with non-linear activation functions) of the feature space to construct a binary output. Both algorithms rely on invariance as a proxy for causality, and invariance in turn relies on having data partitioned by known interventions or perturbations. Each of these methods trains a model using a training set, selects model hyper-parameters using a validation set, and provides a final model accuracy on a held-out test set. CRISP partitions the data into different environments such that the model is trained on data from one environment and then validated and tested on the data from the other environments. CRISP uses two methods of feature reduction to reduce the number of variables to search. The first method removes features whose correlation to the target is below a certain threshold, and the second method uses a multi-layer perceptron to identify the most salient features based on model feature importance.CRISP configuration CRISP experiments are configured with several parameters in a JSON configuration file. By default, the test_val_split parameter defines how much data to dedicate for training, testing, and validation. We overrode this default data splitting configuration and explicitly defined the training, testing, and validation data subsets. The training data is used to train the model parameters, the validation data is used to select the optimal set of model hyperparameters, and the test data is held out after the model is trained and validated to report accuracy. It is this held-out test accuracy that we subsequently report on. The max_features parameter defines the number of features each model in the ensemble should find as most predictive of the target. We used the default value of 20 in our CRISP experiment. The data_options parameter defines the file location containing the dataset, which columns in that dataset are to be used as predictors, which column is the environment variable, and which column is the target variable. There are several other parameters that may be configured in this JSON configuration file which get consumed by the machine learning algorithms configured in the ensemble. The JSON configuration we used in our experiment is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.CRISP ensemble voting CRISP is an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. Ensembles are used to combine a set of multiple “weak” learners into a single “strong” learner to minimize training errors33. Each model in the ensemble is trained on the dataset to identify the features most predictive of the target. After training, each model selects the features (20 by default) which it found as most predictive of the target. For the linear models—linear invariant risk minimization (linear IRM) and linear invariant causal prediction (linear ICP)—the features which are most predictive are those whose coefficients of the linear model have the highest absolute values. For non-linear models—non-linear invariant risk minimization (non-linear IRM) and non-linear invariant causal prediction (non-linear ICP)—the most predictive features are selected through sensitivity analysis (the features which have the highest impact on the response variable). After each model has selected its top-most predictive features, the ensemble votes to elect a single set of (by default, 20) features to present as the final result of the experiment. Non-Causal Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and random forest (RF) are not causal predictors and do not participate in CRISP’s selection of the features. Non-causal ERM relies on statistical minimization of risk or error, while RF is another non-causal method which combines decision trees for a classification result. They are included in the experiment only as a basis of comparison to the causal predictors (non-linear IRM, linear ICP, non-linear ICP, and linear IRM). CRISP attributes the highest weight to the feature that the highest accuracy model gives the largest coefficient (or highest sensitivity). Conversely, the lowest ranking feature from the worst performing model will be attributed the lowest weight. Furthermore, the higher degree of concordance across the ensemble (i.e. how many models found the feature in their top 20 list), the higher the weighted coefficient of that feature. This attribution weight w(k) of feature k is calculated as shown in the following equation. The values pk represent the fraction of models which found this feature k in its list of top (by default, 20) features. The number M is the number of models CRISP is configured to use. The values sm(k) are the absolute values of the linear coefficients (for linear models) or sensitivity factors (for non-linear models) scaled to the unit interval. The values am are the predictive accuracies of the models. In this way, CRISP identifies those features that are most predictive of the target from the highest number of best performing models.CRISP results on synthetic data To help validate whether CRISP is truly identifying features robustly correlated to the target, we ran an experiment in which we synthetically generated a feature space with a known causal relationship to a target using structural equation modeling. Of the 6 known causal features, the CRISP ensemble found 5 of them in its list of top 20 features, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. The probability of this happening at random is 0.00124 as shown in Supplementary Eq. 1. By contrast, the RF and ERM classifiers didn’t find any of the 6 causal features in their top 20 list. This is further evidence that CRISP can distinguish robustly correlated features from uncorrelated ones.CRISP updates Accompanying this paper we publish a CRISPv1.1 code release, with the following updates. First, we updated the linear IRM code to output continuous feature weights such that the coefficients are now on the unit interval [0, 1]. We create confusion matrices for the test results and append them to the results so that we can calculate sensitivity, specificity, and F-1 scores. We changed the default batch size from 128 to 8 to improve accuracy. We updated the configuration to provide a means to override the default method used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Last, we updated the post-processing step by putting their feature coefficients on the scale of z-scores.Results In this section, we show the results of the CRISP experiment. We validate our findings using pathway analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), and a search of relevant literature. We show the results of the gene expression analysis using DESeq2 and EdgeR to compare the CRISP results with commonly used bioinformatic tools. CRISP results Each of the models in the ensemble trains on the same data set to identify the features which best predict the target across all environments. Figure 5 depicts the confusion matrices and performance metrics for each model in the ensemble. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab (a–g) Show confusion matrices and (h) shows performance metrics for each model in the CRISP ensemble. The horizontal rows are the actual classes, and the vertical columns are the predicted classes. We assigned the low lipid density class (0) to “positive” and the high lipid density class (1) to “negative” for the purpose of calculating precision, recall, and F1-score. Precision and F1-score values are undefined for the linear ICP model because it did not predict any positive classes, as shown in (d). The higher the accuracy of the model, the higher the weight associated with the results of that model in the ensemble.The best and worst accuracies in the experiment do not participate in the ensemble vote. The RF test accuracy was the best out of all the models, scoring a 100% accuracy rate (and therefore perfect precision, recall, and F1-score). Conversely, ERM accuracy was the lowest. Non-linear ICP has 89% test accuracy and therefore contributes the most to the ensemble results. Conversely, linear IRM performed the worst across the ensemble (58% test accuracy) and therefore contributes the least to the ensemble results. The linear ICP algorithm did not predict any samples to have a low lipid density, so its precision and F1-scores are undefined. The bar chart in Fig. 6 shows the degree to which each gene across the ensemble is predictive of the lipid density response variable. Based on Fig. 6, we see that the Mup11 gene was found in the top 20 genes most predictive of lipid density in all 5 models. By contrast, the Fasn gene was found in the top 20 genes most predictive of lipid density in only 3 of the models. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab The weight of the top 20 genes and their degree of concordance across the ensemble. The direction of the bar indicates whether the gene expression is predictive of high or low lipid density. Each bar is colored by the number of models which found that gene in their list of the top 20 most predictive genes.The biological functions of the 20 CRISP genes are shown in Table 4. The functions were derived from the information provided in the  Gene tool at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/. Table 4.

Validation using gene set enrichment analysis We used the 20 genes from the CRISP experiment to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp) using the Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) ontology gene sets (C5) collection version v2023.2.Mm. This tool finds those gene ontologies from all ontology gene sets (GO: Gene Ontology and HPO: Human Phenotype Ontology) that have a significant overlap with the query gene set in the mouse genome. Table 5 shows the top gene sets in the C5 collection that significantly overlap with these 20 mouse genes. Table 5.

These gene sets are consistent with our lipid density phenotype as they are involved in the metabolism of fats, and we will explore the scientific literature to determine how these genes are implicated in NAFLD in the “Validation from scientific literature” section.Validation using pathway analysis We submitted the 20 genes resulting from our CRISP experiment, and as background all 8,092 genes which were used in our CRISP experiment, to the KEGG pathway34 of the ShinyGO 0.80 pathway analysis tool (https://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/). This tool finds the Gene Ontology pathways which overlap with the query gene set as compared to the background gene set. Table 6 shows the enriched pathway that ShinyGO identified. Table 6. Enriched gene ontology pathways involving the genes from the CRISP experiment. Pathways Number of CRISP genes Number of KEGG pathway genes Fold enrichment Enrichment FDR Cholesterol metabolism 4 49 45.2 < 0.001 Fatty acid metabolism 2 62 19.8 0.049 Alcoholic liver disease 3 139 15.8 0.01 Open in a new tab The fold enrichment column uses the number of CRISP genes and KEGG pathway genes to measure how over-represented the CRISP genes are as compared to the background. This fold enrichment is then used to provide an enrichment false discovery rate (FDR), all of which are below our 0.05 threshold of significance.Using the enrichment false discovery rate metric of significance, the significant pathways relating to our gene set include cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and alcoholic liver disease. Cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism are consistent with both our gene set enrichment analysis as well as our lipid density phenotype. Lipid dysregulation is a key factor of fatty liver disease: the accumulation of lipids creates a lipotoxic environment that can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and liver damage. The genes enriching these 3 pathways include Apoe, Star, Apoc3, Apoc1, Fasn, Scd1, and Cyp2e1. We will explore the scientific literature to determine how these genes are implicated in NAFLD in the “Validation from scientific literature” section.Validation from SPOKE The Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) is a massive knowledge graph of biomedical information which may be leveraged for a variety of purposes from drug discovery to disease diagnosis35. We used SPOKEv5 to identify disease conditions (derived from the Disease Ontology Knowledgebase36) from the list of 20 genes that CRISP found. Table 7 identifies those disease conditions and their associated adjusted p-value. Table 7. Disease ontologies and associated Bonferroni-corrected p-values. Disease ontology Adjusted p-value Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (DOID: 0080208) < 0.001 Lipid storage disease (DOID:9455) < 0.001 Steatotic liver disease (DOID:9452) 0.001 Disease of metabolism (DOID: 0014667) 0.001 Open in a new tab All the disease ontology identifiers (DOID) that SPOKE found as statistically significantly associated with the CRISP result gene set are related to dysfunctional lipid metabolism.All these statistically significant disease ontologies are consistent with a high lipid density phenotype and NAFLD. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the more recent term used for NAFLD.Validation from scientific literature Table 8 shows one relatively recent and relevant research article that discusses the relationship of NAFLD to each of the CRISP genes which enrich the pathways and gene sets previously discussed.

Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)—Molecular Basis of Disease 1863, 978–990 (2017) Open in a new tab Selection criteria for these articles include journal impact factor (greater than 3), date of publication (within the last 10 years), and relevance to a causal relationship between expression of the gene and the progression of NAFLD.Except for Alg5, all the genes from the gene set and pathway enrichment analyses have previously been shown to be dysregulated in liver inflammation, liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and NAFLD. Fuior et al. discuss how the overexpression of Apoc1 in mice may lead to hyperlipidemia. Lu et al. demonstrated that overexpression of Apoc3 manifests in features similar to NAFLD, including increased hepatic lipid content. Harjumaki et al. discuss the role of Cyp2e1 in the development of NASH which is a precursor condition to NAFLD, suggesting that the over-expression of the Cyp2e1 enzyme and subsequent oxidative stress is sufficient to induce hepatic lipid accumulation. Woolsey et al. found that hepatic mRNA expression of Cyp3a41b in NASH was 69% lower than control livers. Testing its pharmacological inhibition in human cell culture, O’Farrell et al. consider Fasn to be a promising therapeutic target for NASH as they observed that its reduced expression reduced overall triglyceride content, markers of fibrosis and inflammation, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The Gamt gene encodes an enzyme which helps synthesize creatine, and Marinello et al. found that its supplementation has been demonstrated to prevent NAFLD progression. Qin et al. describe how aberrant transcriptional activation of Scd1 causes excessive lipid accumulation and promotes progression of NAFLD (among other metabolic complications), making it a promising therapeutic target. Finally, Qiu et al. found that Star overexpression, among other protective roles, can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation—suggesting it may be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.Comparing CRISP results to other analyses In this section, we compare the results of our CRISP experiments with other tools which associate features with targets including DESeq2, random forest, and empirical risk minimization. Comparing results from CRISP and DESeq2 We used DESeq2 version 1.34.0 to perform differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) on the data on the same set of genes as we used in CRISP to identify which genes are significantly differentially expressed between the high and low ORO groups. DESeq2 performs its own filtering and normalization steps, so we did not transform the data. Because of the distinct batch effect due to library preparation, we added the library preparation covariate to the column data and included it in the DESeq2 design formula along with the ORO threshold value. DESeq2 did not find any genes that were significantly differentially expressed when setting the Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value cutoff to 0.05.Comparing results from CRISP and EdgeR We used EdgeR version 3.36.0 to perform DGEA on the data on the same set of genes as we used in CRISP to identify which genes are significantly differentially expressed between the high and low ORO groups. EdgeR performs its own filtering and normalization steps, so we did not transform the data. Because of the distinct batch effect due to library preparation, we added the library preparation covariate to the column data and included it in the EdgeR design formula along with the ORO threshold value. Table 9 shows the 6 differentially expressed genes from the EdgeR experiment using 0.05 as the Bonferroni adjusted p-value threshold and not using a log2 fold change threshold. Table 9.

Gene Function Atp1a2 Integral membrane protein responsible for establishing and maintaining the electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the plasma membrane Des This gene encodes a muscle-specific class III intermediate filament. Homopolymers of this protein form a stable intracytoplasmic filamentous network connecting myofibrils to each other and to the plasma membrane and are essential for maintaining the strength and integrity of skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle fibers Hsd3b1 Predicted to be involved in several processes, including C21-steroid hormone metabolic process; hippocampus development; and response to corticosterone Tpm2 This gene encodes beta-tropomyosin, a member of the actin filament binding protein family, and mainly expressed in slow, type 1 muscle fibers Star Predicted to enable cholesterol binding activity. Acts upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process; glucocorticoid metabolic process; and regulation of steroid biosynthetic process Akr1b7 Predicted to act upstream of or within cellular lipid metabolic process Open in a new tab Half of these genes are involved in lipid metabolism (Akr1b7, Tpm2, and Star).Submitting these genes to the GSEA tool, we see that these genes are implicated in hyperplasia, abnormal myocardium morphology, reduced systolic function, weakness of facial musculature, and areflexia (shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The ShinyGO tool finds several pathways overlapping these 6 genes, from cardiomyopathy to ovarian steroidogenesis, folate biosynthesis, cortisol synthesis and secretion, thyroid hormone synthesis, pancreatic secretion, cardiomyopathy, Cushing Syndrome, and various metabolic pathways including galactose, cholesterol, fructose, and lipid metabolism. Given such a wide range of pathways and gene sets that affect so many different organs and pathologies, it is not at all clear what, if any, conclusions could be drawn from the EdgeR gene result set.Statistical analysis of gene distributions Taken together, the genes enriched in the pathways and gene sets shown in Tables 5 and 6 include Alg5, Apoc1, Apoc3, Apoe, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a41b, Fasn, Gamt, Scd1, and Star. Figure 7 shows the box-and-whisker plots of the distributions of the raw counts of gene expression for each of these 10 genes between the flight samples and non-flight samples. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Box-and-whisker plots of the distributions of gene expression for each of the genes with associated Wilcoxon p-values comparing flight and non-flight groups. Several p-values are not statistically significant, suggesting that only using statistics to analyze differences in gene expression between groups may not be sufficient.As indicated in Fig. 7, not all the differences between flight and non-flight lipid densities are statistically significant. This suggests that using statistics alone to identify genes predictive of a response may be insufficient in some circumstances. Indeed, the CRISP platform is intended to complement current approaches which rely heavily, if not entirely, on statistical methods.Analyzing results from CRISP when using non-augmented data Running CRISP without data augmentation (i.e. using the original gene expression of the n = 51 samples and using only library preparation in the environment string), CRISP identified the genes in Supplementary Fig. 7 as most predictive of the phenotype. However, pathway enrichment analysis on these 20 genes reveals a long list of pathways, not all of which are related to the phenotype (e.g. hormone synthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and coronavirus disease). We attribute this result to the lack of training data, poor model performance, and insufficient exploitation of invariance in the CRISP experiment.Analyzing results from CRISP when using other environment strings We include Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 to show the CRISP results and model performance when using group in the environment variable rather than library preparation. Because the mean lipid density is significantly different between flight and non-flight groups, we expected the accuracy to be higher in the CRISP models predicting the lipid density response when using the group (flight vs non-flight) in the environment variable rather than library preparation. However, the performance of the ensemble was not as good, and the downstream analyses were inconsistent with respect to liver metabolism. We attribute this to the fact that while the metabolic response to spaceflight in the liver was statistically significantly different than ground control, the gene expression data between the 2 groups does not separate in the PCA plot, as shown in Fig. 4c. We include Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 to show the CRISP results and model performance when using strain in the environment variable rather than library preparation. We observe that while the CRISP experiments have 50% concordance in their gene sets, using library preparation as the environment variable yields more biologically specific and plausible results. The gene ontologies and pathways enriched by the genes that CRISP found when using strain in the environment variable are not uniformly related to lipid metabolism and include pathways such as cardiomyopathy and thyroid hormone synthesis.Analyzing results from the random forest classifier CRISP includes non-causal algorithms in its ensemble to compare results with causal algorithms. While random forest lays no claim to identify features causal of a target, the algorithm is one of the best-performing and highly used ML classification algorithms37. The CRISP ensemble uses the RandomForestClassifier module from version 0.24.2 of the scikit-learn package. Like its causal counterparts, the random forest algorithm calculates a feature importance metric which can be used to define confidence in the results. Among the top 20 genes that random forest identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to the  Gene tool. Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the random forest classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response. The 20 genes which random forest found as most predictive of the lipid density phenotype are shown in Supplementary Table 4.Analyzing results from empirical risk minimization Following the same analysis as with random forest, here we analyze the results from empirical risk minimization (ERM). ERM uses the canonical minimization of the sum of the squares of the residuals as its unconditional objective function. It does not partition the data into environments like IRM. As such, it is perhaps the closest comparison to the linear IRM and non-linear IRM results from CRISP. Among the 20 genes that ERM identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to . Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the ERM classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response. The 20 genes which ERM found as most predictive of the lipid density phenotype are shown in Supplementary Table 5.Discussion The CRISP platform trains an ensemble of binary classifiers on data in one environment and validates and tests them using the data from the other environments. Separating the environments in this way ensures that the ensemble algorithms are rewarded for finding correlations that are independent of biases in the data generating processes. Classifying data independently of the environment is the definition of invariance in this context and leads to more robustly correlated results. Using the CRISP ensemble, we’ve identified a set of genes which are predictive of high and low lipid density. These genes are significantly associated with gene sets and genetic pathways that are consistent with NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction. On the other hand, machine learning methods such as empirical risk minimization and random forest do not distinguish between spurious and non-spurious correlations. In our experiment, their top 20 genes are not biologically related to lipid metabolism, despite the random forest classifier having the highest held-out test accuracy (100%) of all the models in predicting lipid density. The DESeq2 package did not find any genes significantly correlated to our phenotype. The EdgeR package found 6 genes whose expression was significantly correlated to the lipid density response variable—one of which (Star) was also found by CRISP. However, gene set enrichment and pathway analysis tools found a wide variety of conditions and processes associated with these 6 genes, leaving the results difficult to interpret. We attribute these quantitative and qualitative differences in results to the environment invariance modeling approach that the CRISP ML algorithms use in conjunction with the data augmentation methods we leveraged. As opposed to the non-specific pathways enriched by the EdgeR genes, the CRISP genes enrich lipid metabolism pathways including cholesterol, fatty acid, and NAFLD pathways—all of which are consistent with using lipid density as a response in our machine learning models. The NAFLD pathway is significantly enriched by the CRISP gene result set and includes Cyp2e1, Fasn, and Scd1 genes with a 0.014 strength of association, as shown in Table 6. As noted in Table 8, the literature is consistent in finding these genes implicated in experiments on NAFLD. Moreover, the SPOKE knowledge graph found MASLD (the new name for NAFLD) to be the most significantly associated disease ontology with the CRISP gene result set. The use of data augmentation in this CRISP experiment is crucial. Not only does augmentation provide known perturbations of the data as required by CRISP, data augmentation also provides more samples to train, test, and validate the ensemble of machine learning classifiers. Even so, having more samples than 51 would enrich the underlying gene expression signals which would lead to even more robust correlations. We therefore recommend future spaceflight experiments to increase the cohort size and make the liver a standard tissue to collect, process, and analyze. We acknowledge a caveat that the OSD-137 study used the Balb/c mouse strain, while the other three studies used the C57BL6 strain. These two mouse strains are known to have differing responses to spaceflight5. Thus, a future study would benefit from further investigating the responses of the different mouse strains in larger cohorts. To further validate our findings, one could explore other data associated with these same rodents including proteomic and methylation data, as well as leverage existing molecular tests of liver function. A future analysis of the gene expression of ground models of NAFLD may help validate the genes identified here by CRISP. Future work could focus on randomized controlled experiments specifically designed to manipulate the function of each putative gene to verify they do, in fact, cause high or low lipid density in liver tissue. For example, reverse transcriptase PCR or quantitative immunohistochemistry studies on liver samples from controlled experiments could provide key validation results. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) related to fatty liver, steatosis, and NAFLD could be explored to identify the molecular pathways responsible for the lipid density phenotype and to gain a more complete purview of the putative dysfunction. Additionally, to further elucidate a link to human manifestation of NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction, it will be important to address the species differences between mouse and human. In this research, we provide a novel approach to identify potentially causal genes associated with liver dysfunction during spaceflight. These genes constitute potential biomarkers of NAFLD for targeted monitoring or therapeutics development in the future that would otherwise be more time consuming or impossible to identify with traditional statistical or experimental approaches. Given the expense of randomized controlled experiments, having a targeted set of genes putatively causal of the response is invaluable. While the results of our research link the expression of certain genes to a lipid dysregulation phenotype in liver tissue, our approach can be generalized to other tissues, phenotypes, and even other -omics data. For NASA to embark on longer and more frequent space missions, understanding the impact of spaceflight on biological function is paramount. To this end, there are many data sets in OSDR left to explore, and more are continuing to be published.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11659408/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity. Subject terms: Physiology, Translational research",
    "introduction": "Introduction The cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts both during and after spaceflight are variable in terms of sex, duration of exposure, and the model used for the studies. Men and women have different recovery mechanisms from stress factors, which can influence the response to the spaceflight environment1. Though women are known to be protected against heart disease prior to menopause, responses of the vascular system to spaceflight are complicated by additional stress factors including microgravity, space radiation, inactivity, or isolation. Few studies have focused on the sex differences in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceflight in spite of the fact that the proportion of women participating in space missions has reached about 10% and continues to increase2. The empirically reported effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are varied across people who have been in space3. Some common short-term physiological effects of spaceflight include changes in blood volume distribution and alterations in baroreflex function3. Prolonged exposure to spaceflight also impacts cardiovascular system including red blood cell count, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, and cardiac output4–7. Sex-based differences in cardiovascular responses have been reported with changes in both sexes occurring after several weeks in space1,8. Female astronauts experience a greater loss of plasma volume while male astronauts appear to be more prone to develop a spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)9–11. Furthermore, following a 6-month spaceflight, women tended to have greater increases in plasma renin and aldosterone versus men, while both men and women experienced increased carotid artery stiffness5. The observed sex differences underscore the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular changes and sex-specific adaptations to both terrestrial and space-induced stressors important for the development of personalized preventative countermeasures for astronauts. To better understand the changes in cardiovascular adaptations in response to spaceflight environment, terrestrial studies are focused on recapitulating microgravity in human subjects with head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest or in rodent models with hindlimb unloading (HLU)12,13. The mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular system responses and arterial stiffness are not well understood particularly in the female subjects. Furthermore, the majority of HLU studies use male rodent subjects, with even fewer examining differences between sexes. Therefore, the present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the development of central arterial stiffness in female and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats in response to HLU as an analog for spaceflight-induced microgravity.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (A21-039). Female and male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). All rats were housed at 12:12-h light-dark cycle, a constant room temperature and humidity. A standard rodent chow (Lab Diet 5P00 - Prolab RMH 3000, PMI Nutrition International, INC, Brentwood, MO) and water were given ad libitum throughout the experimental protocols. Study timeline Socially and sexually mature female and male SD rats at 20 weeks of age were randomly assigned to study groups. The first experimental set included the following animals: female control (F), female HLU (F HLU), male control (M), or male HLU (M HLU) (n = 5–8 in each group). HLU groups underwent hindlimb unloading for 14 days93. Control groups were exposed to the same cages for a 14-day period. On the morning of day 14, animals were imaged with ultrasound followed by EchoMRI, and then sacrificed to collect tissues. Additional experimental set included two groups of HLU female rats that underwent either treatment with G1, a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) agonist (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or vehicle (n = 4 in each group). G1 was dissolved in 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a dose of 100 μg/kg/day. G1 or vehicle was delivered via osmotic minipumps to female HLU rats for 3 weeks (model 2ML2; Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA)94. Pumps were implanted subcutaneously on the back of the rat’s neck 1-week prior to HLU exposure and continued for 2 weeks during the HLU exposure. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and injury markers were analyzed at the end of the 3-week treatment with G1. Hindlimb unloading (HLU) To determine the effects of microgravity, 20-week-old male and female SD rats were suspended by the tail via HLU for 14 days resulting in a head-down body angle of 30–35 degrees. Age-matched, non-suspended controls remained in similar cages93. Animals were monitored for signs of distress by monitoring food and water intake and loss of body weight throughout the exposure to HLU. Ultrasound assessment of arterial stiffness Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%) and placed on a temperature-controlled platform. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate were monitored throughout the imaging protocol. Hair was removed from the thoracic and neck areas of rats with a depilatory cream prior to imaging. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the aortic arch and common carotid arteries were determined in male and female rats using a MS250 transducer and high-resolution ultrasound imaging system Vevo 2100 LAZR (FujiFilm, VisualSonics). MS250 transducer operates at a frequency of 13–24 MHz and axial resolution of 75/165. The PWV of the aortic arch and carotid arteries was measured by the following equation: the D (mm), distance from ascending to descending artery measured with tracing tool (Vevo Lab software), divided by time interval, Δt, which represent the difference between t2 and t1 (ms). Time intervals between the R-wave of the ECG to the foot of the Doppler waveforms were averaged over at least three cardiac cycles. The foot of the Doppler waveform was defined manually as the intersection between the baseline and the beginning of the ascending or descending aortic velocity, or proximal and distal segments of the common carotid artery. The pulse-transit time in the aortic arch was calculated by subtracting the mean ascending aorta (t1) time interval from the mean descending aorta (t2) time interval. For common carotid arteries, t1 time interval was recorded from the proximal portion of the artery and t2 time interval was recorded from distal portion of the artery. All ultrasound measurements were done by one operator, blinded to the experimental groups. Ultrasound assessment of diastolic function Left ventricle M-mode images were recorded in the short-axis parasternal view. The ejection fraction (EF) was calculated as %EF = ((left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) − left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV)/LVEDV) × 100. Stroke volume (SV) was determined as SV = (LVEDV − LVESV) µl. Cardiac output (CO) was determined as cardiac output (CO) = heart rate (HR) × SV/1000 ml/min. Mitral inflow measurements of early- (Emax) and late (Amax) filling velocities were acquired from an apical four-chamber heart orientation using pulsed wave Doppler with the sample volume placed at the tips of mitral leaflets. The mitral valve septal annular velocities (E′) were also assessed by Doppler tissue imaging from the four-chamber view69. A ratio of E/E’ was computed as a measure of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Greater E/E’ suggests higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. All measured and calculated systolic and diastolic indices are represented as the average of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles. Body composition EchoMRITM Analyzer was used to determine the total body composition in studied groups. Briefly, animal was placed in a clear holder, and then inserted into the EchoMRI Analyzer without anesthesia. Each animal was scanned three times in a row and the average total body fat and lean mass were recorded. Collagen content Aortas were fixed in formalin and ethanol followed by the paraffin-embedding. Aortic sections were cut at thickness of 5 µm. Collagen content was determined by Masson’s trichrome staining (Abcam ab150686). Using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT equipped with NDP.scan and NDP.view, slides containing stained aortic sections were imaged at ×20 magnification. Using Adobe Photoshop 7.0, each slide was quantified for the total area of collagen deposition (red, orange, yellow, or green) and reported as a collagen-to-tissue ratio. Collagen fiber properties Five µm sections were stained with Picrosirius red (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; assay components Cat#: 197378-100G; P6744-16A; 36-554-8) to assess collagen fiber properties. Slides were imaged using polarized light, and 90 × 90 µm representative regions of interest (ROIs) were selected around aortic arch to determine collagen fiber bundling, length, width, straightness, and alignment. Collagen bundling was assessed using an R script that binned hue values in each ROI into red, orange, yellow, and green, in order of high to low collagen bundling15. Data was presented as a ratio of the binned values to the total number of pixels binned. Collagen fiber length, width, and straightness were determined through CT-FIRE software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, The University of Wisconsin-Madison) using default settings95. Coefficient of alignment was determined through CurveAlign software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, The University of Wisconsin-Madison), using default settings95. Smooth muscle fiber characterization Extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics were analyzed using MATLAB and the CT-FIRE algorithm to assess fiber straightness, fiber length, and fiber width. Fiber angle was quantified at the individual fiber level. CT-FIRE excludes empty pixels prior to analysis. Quantification of fibers was done using CT-FIRE and Curve Align scripts15. Elastin fiber content Verhoeff’s stain (American MasterTech; Cat#: KTVEL) was used to quantify elastin content in aortic sections using the manufacturer’s protocol. The staining intensity in the tunica media layer of the aorta was normalized to the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of 255 of the red, green, and blue intensity (RGB) component and reported as relative intensity units96. Morphological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin followed by 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 µm sections. Immunostaining was performed using the avidin biotin complex (ABC) method with 0.1% diaminobenzene solution used as the chromogen as previously described. Antigen retrieval treatment with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was applied at 90–95 °C for 30 min. Non-specific binding was blocked in a buffer containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 30 min. Aortic sections were incubated with goat anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA; Cat#: NB300-978), rabbit anti-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 (1:500 dilution; Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat#: ab53219), rabbit anti-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; 1:10,000 dilution; Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat#: ab46545), rabbit anti-p47 phox (1:400 dilution; LifeSpan BioSciences, Shirley, MA, USA; Cat#: LS-C331296), mouse anti-8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; 1:100 dilution; JaICA, Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan; Cat#: MOG-020P), rabbit anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, 1:200 dilution; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Cat#: 160126), mouse anti-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, 1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Cat#: 610297), mouse anti-macrophages/monocytes antibody, clone ED-1/CD68 (1:200 dilution; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA; Cat#: MAB1435), rabbit anti-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ; 1:1200 dilution; Biorbyt, LLC, Durham, NC, USA; Cat#: orb11291), rabbit anti-GPER (1:200 dilution; Biorbyt, LLC, Durham, NC, USA; Cat#: orb10740) and secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit, mouse or goat antibodies (1:500 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT utilizing NDP.scan and NDP.view as the imaging software at ×20 magnification. Images were analyzed in four fields per aortic cross-section using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 by the investigator blinded to the experimental groups. The staining was normalized to the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of the RGB component and reported as relative intensity units as described96. Statistics Groups were compared using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc tests (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significantly different. All data were presented as mean ± SEM. Discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis The microgravity and sex discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis is designed to create an indexed network for the visualization of binary interaction of variables with large differences in sex-wise correlations given this model of microgravitational challenge and a microgravitational-wise correlations independent of sex. DCS analysis was performed on the 18 variables (Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE, % Lean mass AVE, COX-2, eNOS, GPER, PPARγ, VSMC actin, 8-OHdG, p47phox, TC, VVG, Carotid PWV, Aorta PWV, CF length, CF straightness). Briefly, absolute values of both the log correlation ratios (logcr) of male versus female (for control and HLU groups, log(malep/femalep)) and the log correlation ratios of HLU versus control (for female and male groups, log(HLUp/controlp)) were calculated for each variable combination97. To find large differences between the sex-wise and microgravity-wise correlations (153 combinations from each DCS analysis), we performed these analyses to isolate correlations of interest; 68 combinations (|logcr| ≥ 0.8) were further evaluated after tabulating and indexing by DCS; |logcr| values range from 0.8 to 4.42 or 6.3-fold to 27,000-fold change in p values. For network visualization purposes 8-OHdG and p47phox were combined into an oxidative stress node, VSMC actin, TC, VVG, CF length and CF straightness were combined into an extracellular matrix composition node and Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE and % Lean mass AVE were combined into a body composition node. The 68 above |logcr| ≥ 0.8 edges were plotted with the corresponding variable nodes in Fig. 10. Nodes and edges also illustrated in Tables 2 and 3. All calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft Corp., WA), Prism (GraphPad Software, MA) was used for statistical analyses and plotting data in figures; Cytoscape was used for network generation.",
    "results": "Results Effect of HLU on body weight, organ weight The body weight of male control rats was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the body weight of female control rats (Fig. 1). Similarly, male HLU rats were heavier than female HLU rats (Fig. 1). To account for this variability in body weight while allowing for comparison between sexes, organ weights (heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, uterus) were normalized to individual tibia length values that more accurately reflect physiological changes in organ weights14. Body composition analysis revealed no differences in total fat mass between study groups, however, control unexposed males had greater lean mass compared with control females (Fig. 1). Exposure to HLU reduced lean mass in males (Fig. 1C). Lean-to-fat mass ratio was not different between study groups (Fig. 1). Within each sex, HLU treatment did not affect organ weights (Fig. 1) except the hearts where male rats exposed to HLU had lower heart weight compared to the male control group (Fig. 1). HLU did not affect uterine weight in female SD rats (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. The effect of 14-days of HLU on body and organ weights in 20-week-old female and male Sprague-Dawley rats. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control unexposed animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU). Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05 versus Control Female; #p < 0.05 versus HLU Female; ^p < 0.05 versus Control Male; n = 3–9 per group. Aortic PWV and cardiac function in response to HLU The effect of HLU on PWV of the aortic arch in male and female SD rats was determined (Fig. 2). HLU females had a greater aortic arch PWV compared to control females or HLU males (Fig. 2). No differences were found in PWV in HLU males compared with male controls (Fig. 2). HLU also increased PWV of the left common carotid artery in the female rats compared to female controls (Fig. S1). To determine whether changes in cardiac function could explain differences in PWV caused by HLU exposure, systolic and diastolic function parameters were measured in the female control and HLU rats. Stroke volume and cardiac output were not different between control and HLU female groups (Fig. S2A, B). Although within normal ranges, female HLU rats had increased ejection fraction compared to control female rats (Fig. S2C). Diastolic function, measured by E/E’ ratio was worse in HLU female rats versus female controls (Fig. S2D). Fig. 2. Aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV) in female and male rats in response to HLU. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control unexposed animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) (A). Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05 versus Control Female; n = 5–8 per group. PWV was calculated as PWV = D/pulse transit time Δt, where D is the distance between two points in mm (t2 and t1) in the aortic arch, and t is the signal transit time estimated between R on electrocardiogram and the beginning of the Doppler wave in ms (B–D). Aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) and contractile components α-smooth muscle actin and myosin were assessed in the media of aortic arch of female and male rats following HLU exposure (Fig. 3). The aortas of male controls had greater levels of both proteins compared to control females. HLU had no effect on either α-smooth muscle actin or myosin in female or male rats (Fig. 3). Collagen and elastin contents, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in control or HLU female or male rats (Fig. 4). Fig. 3. Smooth muscle (SM) contractile protein staining of aortic media.

Open in a new tab Aortas were stained for collagen by Picrosirius Red stain (A, C) and elastin by Verhoeff’s stain (B, D). Collagen-to-elastin ratio is shown on panel E. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4–5. Magnification: ×20.Collagen bundling in the aorta was measured by hue analysis to gain understanding of the changes in collagen density after HLU and between sexes (Fig. 5). Results were normalized to the number of total pixels. Through picrosirius red staining and imaging with polarized light, highly dense collagen appears red while very loosely bundled collagen appears green, with orange and yellow colors representing intermediary values (Fig. 5). Hue analysis determined collagen content based on standardized binning of colors as previously reported15,16. All groups followed a similar collagen bundling pattern where prevalence of dense fibers was the highest while the prevalence of fibers with loose collagen was the lowest (Fig. 5). Female control rats had greater red collagen compared with male controls (Fig. 5). However, HLU exposure did not influence the dense collagen fibers (red) in female rats in comparison to control females. Less bundled collagen (yellow and green) was lower in female controls compared to male controls (Fig. 5). HLU did not affect the prevalence of the loosely bundled collagen (yellow or green) in any of the groups. When the data were not normalized to total pixels, female HLU rats had significantly a higher amount of highly dense collagen bundling (red) compared to all other groups (Fig. S3). Fig. 5. Collagen fiber bundling in the aorta of female and male SD rats in response to HLU. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU). Picrosirius red stained slides were imaged with polarized light, and the pixel values of representative regions were binned into red, orange, yellow, and green hues, corresponding to a respective decrease in collagen bundling. The data are presented as a ratio of the number of pixels of each color category over the total across all color categories per group. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4–7; *p < 0.05 versus Control Female.To determine the alignment of smooth muscle fibers in the aorta, fiber angle was assessed by CurveAlign software. Representative images of the aorta from each group are shown on Fig. 6A. Various additional ECM characteristics such as fiber straightness, length, and width were analyzed per animal in each group using CT-Fire software. HLU did not affect any of the studied parameters in either male or female groups (Fig. 6B). No differences were evident between sexes in control or HLU-treated groups (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6. Collagen fiber characterization in female and male SD rats. Open in a new tab Female and male rat aortas in both control and HLU groups were collected after 14 days of either control or HLU exposure. Picrosirius red stained slides were imaged with polarized light, with representative images from each group shown (A).

Fiber alignment was quantified using CurveAlign software (B). Magnification: ×20. The impact of HLU on aortic GPER GPER staining in aortic media was lower in control males versus control females. HLU reduced the levels of GPER in females versus control females. No differences in aortic GPER were found in males in response to HLU (Fig. 7). Fig. 7.

The impact of HLU on aortic inflammation, oxidative stress Male control rats had lower levels of PPAR-γ and COX-2 in the aortic media compared with control female rats (Fig. 8A, B). PPAR-γ levels decreased in female rats following HLU (Fig. 8A). HLU did not affect the levels of COX-2, eNOS, or CD68 in the aortic media of female or male rats (Fig. 8B–D). However, p47 phox and 8-OHdG levels were increased in the aortic media in the female group after HLU compared with the female control group (Fig. 8E, F). 4-HNE was lower in control males versus control females, but no differences were found in the aortas of HLU-exposed females or males versus respective controls (Fig. 8G).

G1 effects on aortic PWV, injury markers, uterine weight There were no differences in body weight or organ weights in G1 treated female SD rats versus control SD females (Table 1). G1 administration reduced aortic arch PWV in female rats exposed to HLU (Fig. 9A). No difference in heart rate was evident in female rats after G1 treatment (Fig. 9B). The levels of 8-OHdG decreased following G1 treatment in HLU female rats (Fig. 9C). No differences in p47phox or PPAR γ levels were detected in HLU females after G1 treatment (Fig. 9D, E). Table 1.

Table 2 demonstrates differential variable relationships in male versus female SD rats independent of HLU exposure. Several important relationships were identified in males versus females such as oxidative stress markers with ECM characteristics (collagen content and collagen fiber straightness), and arterial stiffness with COX-2 or eNOS. However, in females, the strongest relationships were within body composition parameters; eNOS with lean mass, VSMC actin with elastin, and less strong relationship between GPER with p47phox. These data suggest sex differences in various relationships among variables independent of HLU exposure. Table 3 shows differential variable relationships in control versus HLU SD rats independent of sex. The strongest relationships were identified between variables of body composition with arterial stiffness or with oxidative stress in unexposed control rats. Independent of sex, PPARγ was related to VSMC actin in unexposed controls. In the HLU group, PPARγ was related to collagen; while arterial stiffness - to body composition variables. Fig. 10.

    "discussion": "Discussion Recent studies highlighted the incidence of arterial stiffness in astronauts following spaceflight. The exposure of rodents to ground-based analogs of microgravity via HLU also demonstrated development of arterial stiffness. However, few studies investigated sex differences and the potential sex-specific mechanisms leading to arterial stiffness due to microgravity. As space exploration continues to expand with longer and more distant missions, understanding the cardiovascular adaptations in female and male astronauts will be crucial to ensure the long-term health and personalized medical care for astronauts1. In this study, we investigated sex-specific effects on the cardiovascular system in a rodent-based model of simulated microgravity via 14 days of exposure to HLU17. The major findings of this study are that female and male SD rats respond differently to HLU demonstrating a greater arterial stiffness in females at the end of the exposure compared with males. Increased arterial stiffness was accompanied by lower levels of aortic GPER and PPARγ and increased oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG and p47 phox) in females but not males after HLU. The females also exhibited diastolic dysfunction after HLU (males were not evaluated in this experiment). Furthermore, administration of G1, an agonist for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER, reversed the HLU-induced increase in PWV in female rats and decreased 8-OHdG, suggesting that lower GPER in the setting of simulated microgravity contributes to arterial stiffening. Our findings also suggest that the SD female rat is a suitable model to study mechanisms underlying the development of arterial stiffness in females in response to simulated microgravity. It is well known that during spaceflight, the cardiovascular system adapts to the state of microgravity by a variety of changes including redistribution of blood flow with fluid shift towards the upper body and decrease in venous return and resistance18. Sex differences were reported in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceflight, however only a few studies investigated the effects of microgravity on arterial stiffening by including subjects of both sexes, and even fewer have made explicit side-by-side comparisons between male and female subjects1,5,10,19–24. A few reports also show conflicting results on whether arterial stiffness is reversible following the exposure to microgravity or HDT bed rest25,26. Furthermore, the long-term consequences of the exposure to arterial stiffening are unknown but may influence future abnormal hemodynamic responses to stressors and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease particularly in older females27–32. A greater aortic PWV in the female SD rats compared to males after HLU suggests sex differences in the development of central arterial stiffening following the exposure to simulated microgravity in this model. PWV differs between women and men during various stages of life ranging from lower baseline PWV in females versus males pre-puberty, similar brachial-ankle PWV in both sexes during adulthood, and a greater increase in PWV in females after menopause suggesting hormonal influences on PWV33–35. Furthermore, women undergoing cardiac stress often experience increased aortic wall thickness compared to men, highlighting a potential increased susceptibility of females to developing arterial stiffness36. In contrast to other reports, our study did not find changes in arterial stiffness in male SD rats in response to HLU23. The response seen in SD rats may be different from those seen in other rodents. Furthermore, it has been reported that corticosterone levels are lower in resting male SD rats compared with Wistar rats37, suggesting strain differences in the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis38. Since hormonal regulation of vasculature underlies its response to stress, it is safe to assume that the response of male Wistar rats could be exacerbated by greater resting activities of HPA and corticosterone compared with male SD. Furthermore, the exposure length to HLU, age of rats, and the differences in strain responses to stress may explain the observed discrepancies. In addition, HDT bed rest is used to study the responses of cardiovascular system to spaceflight. Sixty-day exposure to HDT increases blood pressure, reduces arterial compliance, and increases arterial stiffness measured by cardiac MRI during the HDT phase in healthy subjects26. Surprisingly, another study using the same study cohort found no differences in brachial-femoral pulse wave velocity, but a tendency for an increase of the aortic cross-sectional area was evident suggesting increased vascular filling39. The observed vascular changes returned to baseline during the 4 days of recovery suggesting functional mechanisms underlying arterial stiffening in this cohort26,39. Of note, no sex effect was observed in these two studies potentially due to small sample size26,39. The timing interval of pulse transition time was also decreased in healthy male subjects after 60 day HDT protocol suggesting arterial stiffening40. In contrast, increased aortic stiffening measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity did not completely recover after 1 month of head-down bed rest in healthy men without cardiovascular risk41. Since arterial stiffness may increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease, understanding the mechanisms leading to arterial stiffening in response to spaceflight may facilitate the development of countermeasures that can improve the cardiovascular health of astronauts post-flight. The mechanisms of increased arterial stiffness due to microgravity are not well understood. It has been suggested that arterial stiffness could be a compensatory mechanism necessary to maintain cardiac output in response to orthostatic stress after spaceflight26. Although we have not directly measured total peripheral resistance, the increased stiffness in females was associated with maintained cardiac output and stroke volume after HLU. In addition, although there was a significant increase in ejection fraction in females after HLU, the ejection fraction values were within the normal range for rats at this age. The significance of these findings needs further investigation by examining the presence of subclinical left ventricle systolic dysfunction using more advanced features of strain rate imaging42. In contrast, we found a significant increase in E/E’ ratio in female rats after HLU suggesting diastolic dysfunction. These data are in agreement with recent studies including the Framingham Heart Study that reported correlations of arterial stiffness with left ventricular diastolic function43–45. It is possible that increased aortic stiffness leads to left ventricular hypertrophy followed by lower filling pressure and reduced coronary flow45. Thus, the increased E/E’ ratio in females after HLU in addition to greater left common carotid artery stiffness in our study may indirectly suggest the reduction of left ventricle filling pressure. Arterial stiffness, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were greater in women versus men in the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study, where the authors suggested that higher arterial stiffness may contribute to higher susceptibility of women to develop heart failure with normal ejection fraction46. The return of cardiovascular system to normal functioning after spaceflight may be delayed by lower vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries in those who developed arterial stiffness emphasizing the need for longitudinal assessment of sex-specific risk of cardiovascular events in astronauts with arterial stiffness following long-term spaceflights47,48. In addition, other hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure can influence the extent of arterial stiffness. Higher blood pressures were reported in male SD or male Wistar rats compared to controls after 14 days of HLU49,50. Therefore, it is possible that the response of blood pressure after HLU was different in male versus female SD rats contributing to differences in PWV. Our future studies will incorporate blood pressure measurements during HLU exposure to establish the interactions of estrogen receptors and arterial hemodynamics. Changes in mechanical forces (shear stress and pressure) or ECM composition are important for the regulation of aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) support of the arterial compliance and the response of VSMC to increases in blood volume or pressure51. We investigated the alterations in ECM components as a potential contributor to increased PWV. Male rats had greater expression of aortic α smooth muscle actin and myosin, however no differences in these cytoskeletal elements were detected in either female or male rats after HLU. In contrast, lower expression of α smooth muscle actin with potential switch to synthetic phenotype was reported in cerebral arteries suggesting vessel-specific alterations in cytoskeleton in response to HLU52. An increase in collagen cross-linking and deposition and decrease in elastin content may also lead to increased aortic stiffness and lower arterial compliance. Our findings reveal no differences in collagen content after 14 days of HLU. These data are consistent with reports demonstrating that structural remodeling may not be the primary mechanism leading to arterial stiffness in astronauts after spaceflights25 suggesting that other factors such as systemic (neurohumoral) or local endothelial factors may have an impact on the development of arterial stiffness5,23. However, others reported that HLU resulted in increased deposition of extracellular collagen in the basilar artery but not femoral artery in rats53. The hydroxyproline content as a measure of collagen content was increased in male Wistar rats, however collagen subtype composition was not different between control and HLU-exposed rats in this cohort23. These studies suggest that hypertrophic response to HLU is vascular bed specific. Furthermore, our data revealed no differences in fiber characteristics including alignment, straightness, length, or width suggesting that 14-day exposure to HLU does not induces changes in collagen fiber characteristics in SD rats. This was a surprising finding considering a possibility of an increased stress on collagen fibers and their potential gradual strengthening under pressure due to HLU54. Increased stiffness of collagen fibers may also affect smooth muscle cell phenotype, cell proliferation, or cause downregulation of vascular contractility55,56. Increased fiber angle may indicate greater alignment between smooth muscle fibers potentially contributing to increased stiffness57. Furthermore, highly dense and stiff matrices can promote crosstalk between estrogen receptors and prolactin supporting the hypothesis that changes of the physical environment, such as in microgravity, can be affected by estrogen receptors58. Unlike collagen, another major ECM protein, elastin, is responsible for elasticity, reversible expansion and relaxation of large arteries59. Despite elastin being a critical component of the aorta’s ability to deform under stress, few studies have investigated elastin in response to HLU exposure. No statistically relevant differences in elastin expression or collagen-to-elastin ratio were found in either female or male rats after HLU exposure. However, the female HLU group had a wide standard deviation which consisted of several subjects having decreased elastin expression after HLU exposure compared to the mean. For those individuals, the cause of decreased elastin after HLU exposure is unclear. Elastin in the aorta could decrease with age or in the setting of arterial stiffness. However, similar to our study, aortic elastin content was not altered in male Wistar rats after HLU23. Sex differences in the cardiovascular system may depend in part on the levels of sex hormone receptors and signaling induced by their actions. In non-pregnant female mice, aortic PWV was reported to be lower in estrus cycle compared with diestrus suggesting that the development of vascular stiffening may in part be influenced by the levels of ovarian hormones60. Indeed, our preliminary data agrees with previous reports suggesting that the removal of sex hormones via ovariectomy increases arterial stiffening in the female rats. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show that HLU did not change PWV in aorta or carotid artery of ovariectomized rats (Fig. S4). Similarly, ovariectomy did not exacerbate muscle loss in Fisher female rats during the exposure to either simulated microgravity or partial-gravity environments61. These data together with our findings suggest that the activation of local vascular estrogen receptors may have a greater impact on the development of arterial stiffness after HLU than changes in the ovarian hormones. Furthermore, arterial stiffness is associated with genetic variants of estrogen receptor subtypes suggesting a link between arterial stiffness and estrogen receptors expression62. Although the data on the status of estrogen receptors in response to spaceflight or microgravity analogs are limited, Holets et al. reported a downregulation of estrogen receptor α mRNA and protein in the uterus and ovary of mice after the spaceflight63. However, to our knowledge the response of GPER to HLU in the aorta or other tissues was not yet been considered particularly in the context of sex differences. GPER is a membrane-bound estrogen receptor with protective actions in the cardiovascular system64. GPER is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body of both sexes65. Our data showed sex differences in aortic GPER levels between unexposed animals. However, this difference was lost when GPER decreased in the females after HLU. In addition, our data revealed a strong relationship between aortic pulse-wave velocity and GPER in males. In agreement with previous reports, G1 administration reduced aortic pulse-wave velocity demonstrating a protective role of GPER activation against arterial stiffening66–71. Recent preclinical studies highlighted a protective role of GPER in the regulation of blood pressure, diastolic function, vascular reactivity, arterial stiffness, and aortic remodeling66–71. In contrast, the knockout of GPER in male mice increased endothelial prostanoid-mediated vasoconstriction of the thoracic aorta without changing eNOS mRNA levels or eNOS activity72. In addition, the intracarotid pulse wave velocities were similar between male and female GPER knockout mice, however the response to angiotensin II showed greater increases in elastin and smooth muscle but less collagen deposition in male GPER knockout mice versus females revealing sex differences in vascular remodeling67. Aortic pulse-wave velocity in HLU males was also correlated with heart weight. Indeed, heart weight was lower in male SD after HLU, but did not change in females. The mechanisms and consequences of reduced heart weight in SD HLU male rats are unknown, while cardiac atrophy was suggested to contribute to the reductions in cardiac function after spaceflight18. Furthermore, although estrogen has an established role in the regulation of adiposity, the effect of GPER deletion on body weight revealed contrasting results with studies reporting increased or decreased body weight in GPER knockout mice versus control counterparts73,74. Our data showed no changes in body weight, fat mass or lean mass in females after HLU, however similar to other reports, HLU decreased lean body mass in male SD rats75. In addition, there was strong correlation between body weight and lean body mass in both sexes. These changes appeared to be unrelated to GPER as no relationship between lean mass and GPER was detected. Fat mass however was not different among studied groups potentially due to small number of subjects used for this analysis which led to large data variability in female controls and male subjects. Future studies using GPER knockout mice of both sexes could provide more insight on the role of GPER in vascular adaptations to HLU. Since GPER actions has been linked to antioxidant effects in cardiovascular system65,76, we tested the levels of oxidative stress markers in the aorta of female versus male rats following HLU. Our data showed increased levels of DNA damage marker 8-OHdG in the aorta of HLU females but not in male rats suggesting increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, the absence of differences in the levels of lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE suggests a more pronounced DNA damage77. In agreement, a 72-h exposure to simulated microgravity through a rotary cell culture system resulted in increased expression of the DNA damage markers in human promyelocytic leukemia cells78. Previous reports also demonstrated increased circulating levels of 8-OHdG in rats after HLU, in human patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as in patients with diabetes where higher 8-OHdG was positively correlated with PWV79–81. Lower levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase were reported in skeletal muscle of male SD rats after 28 days of HLU suggesting that lower activity of antioxidant enzymes may also contribute to the increase of superoxide levels after HLU82. The correlations of 8-OHdG with collagen and to a lesser degree with elastin in our study suggest that long-term exposure to oxidative stress could promote ECM remodeling and further exacerbate aortic stiffening in response to HLU83. Furthermore, the reduction of pulse wave velocity by G1 administration in HLU females was accompanied by decreased 8-OHdG suggesting that the protective actions of GPER may involve reduction of vascular oxidative stress70. These data agree with previous reports demonstrating antioxidant effects of GPER activation in various tissues including aorta of hypertensive rats where 2-week administration of G1 reduced lipid peroxidation68. Although the major strength of our studies was a comparison between female and male SD rat responses to HLU, G1 treatment experiments were performed only in female rats, thus sex specific responses to G1 were not established; thus, future studies should also consider the response of male SD subjects to G1 activation in the setting of HLU. A crosstalk between GPER and PPARγ in anti-inflammatory protection against global cerebral ischemia has been suggested in ovariectomized rats84. PPARγ is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in estrogen-based protection of the cardiovascular and renal systems85,86. PPARγ is also closely linked to cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction and therefore has the potential for being targeted by HLU which induces cardiovascular changes similar to aging or menopause87. Our data revealed lower PPARγ levels in the aorta of female rats in response to HLU88, as well as a correlation of PPARγ with collagen content in HLU aortas. Considering the role of PPARγ in the regulation of vasodilation, vascular redox state, bioavailability of nitric oxide, as well as regulation of VSMC stiffness89, our data implies that lower PPARγ may result in reduced protection against arterial stiffness caused by the exposure to HLU. Indeed, the activation of PPARγ by pioglitazone attenuated arterial stiffness and obesity-induced elastin fiber fragmentation in perivascular adipose tissue of diabetic mice suggesting that protective effects of PPARγ against arterial stiffening may involve ECM remodeling mechanisms90. Furthermore, we investigated the expression patterns of CD68-positive macrophage/monocytes, eNOS and COX-2 in the aorta after HLU. The eNOS regulation in the vasculature in response to HLU may depend on the vascular bed or the length of the exposure47,91. Lower nitric oxide availability due to formation of peroxynitrite has been suggested as a contributing factor to superoxide production in vasculature after HLU92. However, our data revealed no differences in eNOS or COX-2 among studied groups. Future studies will assess nitric oxide bioavailability and aortic vascular reactivity in response to nitric oxide and COX-2 inhibition to determine if functional vasodilatory responses are altered in female rats after HLU. Although no differences in eNOS levels were detected in male aortas, there was a strong correlation between eNOS and ECM in male SD suggesting a potential influence of eNOS on ECM remodeling. However, a small sample size in the analysis of immunostaining of various vascular markers or G1 treatment potentially limited our ability to detect significant effects between study groups. The use of multivariate analysis of data provided additional insights on potential relationships between studied variables; thus, strengthening the conclusions of this study. Finally, the mechanisms and long-term consequences of arterial stiffness developed in response to spaceflight are not well understood. The present study demonstrated sex differences in the development of arterial stiffening in SD rats exposed to simulated microgravity. Although the cellular mechanisms of the interaction between microgravity, the cardiovascular system and estrogen receptors in response to HLU need further investigation, our study revealed that lower GPER in the females contributes to the development of arterial stiffness during HLU, and that the SD rat is a suitable model to study these interactions. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis identified several significant relationships between studied variables based on sex or the exposure to HLU that could be explored in future studies focused on the development of destiffening agents as a countermeasure for arterial stiffness.",

Copyright notice ID: 11659408 PMID: 39702444 Abstract Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity. Subject terms: Physiology, Translational researchIntroduction The cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts both during and after spaceflight are variable in terms of sex, duration of exposure, and the model used for the studies. Men and women have different recovery mechanisms from stress factors, which can influence the response to the spaceflight environment1. Though women are known to be protected against heart disease prior to menopause, responses of the vascular system to spaceflight are complicated by additional stress factors including microgravity, space radiation, inactivity, or isolation. Few studies have focused on the sex differences in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceflight in spite of the fact that the proportion of women participating in space missions has reached about 10% and continues to increase2. The empirically reported effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are varied across people who have been in space3. Some common short-term physiological effects of spaceflight include changes in blood volume distribution and alterations in baroreflex function3. Prolonged exposure to spaceflight also impacts cardiovascular system including red blood cell count, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, and cardiac output4–7. Sex-based differences in cardiovascular responses have been reported with changes in both sexes occurring after several weeks in space1,8. Female astronauts experience a greater loss of plasma volume while male astronauts appear to be more prone to develop a spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)9–11. Furthermore, following a 6-month spaceflight, women tended to have greater increases in plasma renin and aldosterone versus men, while both men and women experienced increased carotid artery stiffness5. The observed sex differences underscore the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular changes and sex-specific adaptations to both terrestrial and space-induced stressors important for the development of personalized preventative countermeasures for astronauts. To better understand the changes in cardiovascular adaptations in response to spaceflight environment, terrestrial studies are focused on recapitulating microgravity in human subjects with head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest or in rodent models with hindlimb unloading (HLU)12,13. The mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular system responses and arterial stiffness are not well understood particularly in the female subjects. Furthermore, the majority of HLU studies use male rodent subjects, with even fewer examining differences between sexes. Therefore, the present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the development of central arterial stiffness in female and male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats in response to HLU as an analog for spaceflight-induced microgravity.Results Effect of HLU on body weight, organ weight The body weight of male control rats was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the body weight of female control rats (Fig. 1). Similarly, male HLU rats were heavier than female HLU rats (Fig. 1). To account for this variability in body weight while allowing for comparison between sexes, organ weights (heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, uterus) were normalized to individual tibia length values that more accurately reflect physiological changes in organ weights14. Body composition analysis revealed no differences in total fat mass between study groups, however, control unexposed males had greater lean mass compared with control females (Fig. 1). Exposure to HLU reduced lean mass in males (Fig. 1C). Lean-to-fat mass ratio was not different between study groups (Fig. 1). Within each sex, HLU treatment did not affect organ weights (Fig. 1) except the hearts where male rats exposed to HLU had lower heart weight compared to the male control group (Fig. 1). HLU did not affect uterine weight in female SD rats (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. The effect of 14-days of HLU on body and organ weights in 20-week-old female and male Sprague-Dawley rats. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control unexposed animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU). Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05 versus Control Female; #p < 0.05 versus HLU Female; ^p < 0.05 versus Control Male; n = 3–9 per group.Aortic PWV and cardiac function in response to HLU The effect of HLU on PWV of the aortic arch in male and female SD rats was determined (Fig. 2). HLU females had a greater aortic arch PWV compared to control females or HLU males (Fig. 2). No differences were found in PWV in HLU males compared with male controls (Fig. 2). HLU also increased PWV of the left common carotid artery in the female rats compared to female controls (Fig. S1). To determine whether changes in cardiac function could explain differences in PWV caused by HLU exposure, systolic and diastolic function parameters were measured in the female control and HLU rats. Stroke volume and cardiac output were not different between control and HLU female groups (Fig. S2A, B). Although within normal ranges, female HLU rats had increased ejection fraction compared to control female rats (Fig. S2C). Diastolic function, measured by E/E’ ratio was worse in HLU female rats versus female controls (Fig. S2D). Fig. 2. Aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV) in female and male rats in response to HLU. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control unexposed animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) (A). Data are mean ± SEM, *p < 0.05 versus Control Female; n = 5–8 per group. PWV was calculated as PWV = D/pulse transit time Δt, where D is the distance between two points in mm (t2 and t1) in the aortic arch, and t is the signal transit time estimated between R on electrocardiogram and the beginning of the Doppler wave in ms (B–D).Aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) and contractile components α-smooth muscle actin and myosin were assessed in the media of aortic arch of female and male rats following HLU exposure (Fig. 3). The aortas of male controls had greater levels of both proteins compared to control females. HLU had no effect on either α-smooth muscle actin or myosin in female or male rats (Fig. 3). Collagen and elastin contents, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in control or HLU female or male rats (Fig. 4). Fig. 3. Smooth muscle (SM) contractile protein staining of aortic media.

Open in a new tab Aortas were stained for collagen by Picrosirius Red stain (A, C) and elastin by Verhoeff’s stain (B, D). Collagen-to-elastin ratio is shown on panel E. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4–5. Magnification: ×20.Collagen bundling in the aorta was measured by hue analysis to gain understanding of the changes in collagen density after HLU and between sexes (Fig. 5). Results were normalized to the number of total pixels. Through picrosirius red staining and imaging with polarized light, highly dense collagen appears red while very loosely bundled collagen appears green, with orange and yellow colors representing intermediary values (Fig. 5). Hue analysis determined collagen content based on standardized binning of colors as previously reported15,16. All groups followed a similar collagen bundling pattern where prevalence of dense fibers was the highest while the prevalence of fibers with loose collagen was the lowest (Fig. 5). Female control rats had greater red collagen compared with male controls (Fig. 5). However, HLU exposure did not influence the dense collagen fibers (red) in female rats in comparison to control females. Less bundled collagen (yellow and green) was lower in female controls compared to male controls (Fig. 5). HLU did not affect the prevalence of the loosely bundled collagen (yellow or green) in any of the groups. When the data were not normalized to total pixels, female HLU rats had significantly a higher amount of highly dense collagen bundling (red) compared to all other groups (Fig. S3). Fig. 5. Collagen fiber bundling in the aorta of female and male SD rats in response to HLU. Open in a new tab Clear bars indicate control animals; checkered bars indicate rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU). Picrosirius red stained slides were imaged with polarized light, and the pixel values of representative regions were binned into red, orange, yellow, and green hues, corresponding to a respective decrease in collagen bundling. The data are presented as a ratio of the number of pixels of each color category over the total across all color categories per group. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 4–7; *p < 0.05 versus Control Female.To determine the alignment of smooth muscle fibers in the aorta, fiber angle was assessed by CurveAlign software. Representative images of the aorta from each group are shown on Fig. 6A. Various additional ECM characteristics such as fiber straightness, length, and width were analyzed per animal in each group using CT-Fire software. HLU did not affect any of the studied parameters in either male or female groups (Fig. 6B). No differences were evident between sexes in control or HLU-treated groups (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6. Collagen fiber characterization in female and male SD rats. Open in a new tab Female and male rat aortas in both control and HLU groups were collected after 14 days of either control or HLU exposure. Picrosirius red stained slides were imaged with polarized light, with representative images from each group shown (A). ECM characteristics were analyzed using CT-FIRE software to assess the straightness, length, and width of individual fibers (B), with n = 4–7 animals per group. Fiber alignment was quantified using CurveAlign software (B). Magnification: ×20.The impact of HLU on aortic GPER GPER staining in aortic media was lower in control males versus control females. HLU reduced the levels of GPER in females versus control females. No differences in aortic GPER were found in males in response to HLU (Fig. 7). Fig. 7.

Magnification: ×20.The impact of HLU on aortic inflammation, oxidative stress Male control rats had lower levels of PPAR-γ and COX-2 in the aortic media compared with control female rats (Fig. 8A, B). PPAR-γ levels decreased in female rats following HLU (Fig. 8A). HLU did not affect the levels of COX-2, eNOS, or CD68 in the aortic media of female or male rats (Fig. 8B–D). However, p47 phox and 8-OHdG levels were increased in the aortic media in the female group after HLU compared with the female control group (Fig. 8E, F). 4-HNE was lower in control males versus control females, but no differences were found in the aortas of HLU-exposed females or males versus respective controls (Fig. 8G).

G1 administration reduced aortic arch PWV in female rats exposed to HLU (Fig. 9A). No difference in heart rate was evident in female rats after G1 treatment (Fig. 9B). The levels of 8-OHdG decreased following G1 treatment in HLU female rats (Fig. 9C). No differences in p47phox or PPAR γ levels were detected in HLU females after G1 treatment (Fig. 9D, E). Table 1.

Table 2 demonstrates differential variable relationships in male versus female SD rats independent of HLU exposure. Several important relationships were identified in males versus females such as oxidative stress markers with ECM characteristics (collagen content and collagen fiber straightness), and arterial stiffness with COX-2 or eNOS. However, in females, the strongest relationships were within body composition parameters; eNOS with lean mass, VSMC actin with elastin, and less strong relationship between GPER with p47phox. These data suggest sex differences in various relationships among variables independent of HLU exposure. Table 3 shows differential variable relationships in control versus HLU SD rats independent of sex. The strongest relationships were identified between variables of body composition with arterial stiffness or with oxidative stress in unexposed control rats. Independent of sex, PPARγ was related to VSMC actin in unexposed controls. In the HLU group, PPARγ was related to collagen; while arterial stiffness - to body composition variables. Fig. 10.

The exposure of rodents to ground-based analogs of microgravity via HLU also demonstrated development of arterial stiffness. However, few studies investigated sex differences and the potential sex-specific mechanisms leading to arterial stiffness due to microgravity. As space exploration continues to expand with longer and more distant missions, understanding the cardiovascular adaptations in female and male astronauts will be crucial to ensure the long-term health and personalized medical care for astronauts1. In this study, we investigated sex-specific effects on the cardiovascular system in a rodent-based model of simulated microgravity via 14 days of exposure to HLU17. The major findings of this study are that female and male SD rats respond differently to HLU demonstrating a greater arterial stiffness in females at the end of the exposure compared with males. Increased arterial stiffness was accompanied by lower levels of aortic GPER and PPARγ and increased oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG and p47 phox) in females but not males after HLU. The females also exhibited diastolic dysfunction after HLU (males were not evaluated in this experiment). Furthermore, administration of G1, an agonist for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER, reversed the HLU-induced increase in PWV in female rats and decreased 8-OHdG, suggesting that lower GPER in the setting of simulated microgravity contributes to arterial stiffening. Our findings also suggest that the SD female rat is a suitable model to study mechanisms underlying the development of arterial stiffness in females in response to simulated microgravity. It is well known that during spaceflight, the cardiovascular system adapts to the state of microgravity by a variety of changes including redistribution of blood flow with fluid shift towards the upper body and decrease in venous return and resistance18. Sex differences were reported in the adaptations of the cardiovascular system to spaceflight, however only a few studies investigated the effects of microgravity on arterial stiffening by including subjects of both sexes, and even fewer have made explicit side-by-side comparisons between male and female subjects1,5,10,19–24. A few reports also show conflicting results on whether arterial stiffness is reversible following the exposure to microgravity or HDT bed rest25,26. Furthermore, the long-term consequences of the exposure to arterial stiffening are unknown but may influence future abnormal hemodynamic responses to stressors and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease particularly in older females27–32. A greater aortic PWV in the female SD rats compared to males after HLU suggests sex differences in the development of central arterial stiffening following the exposure to simulated microgravity in this model. PWV differs between women and men during various stages of life ranging from lower baseline PWV in females versus males pre-puberty, similar brachial-ankle PWV in both sexes during adulthood, and a greater increase in PWV in females after menopause suggesting hormonal influences on PWV33–35. Furthermore, women undergoing cardiac stress often experience increased aortic wall thickness compared to men, highlighting a potential increased susceptibility of females to developing arterial stiffness36. In contrast to other reports, our study did not find changes in arterial stiffness in male SD rats in response to HLU23. The response seen in SD rats may be different from those seen in other rodents. Furthermore, it has been reported that corticosterone levels are lower in resting male SD rats compared with Wistar rats37, suggesting strain differences in the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis38. Since hormonal regulation of vasculature underlies its response to stress, it is safe to assume that the response of male Wistar rats could be exacerbated by greater resting activities of HPA and corticosterone compared with male SD. Furthermore, the exposure length to HLU, age of rats, and the differences in strain responses to stress may explain the observed discrepancies. In addition, HDT bed rest is used to study the responses of cardiovascular system to spaceflight. Sixty-day exposure to HDT increases blood pressure, reduces arterial compliance, and increases arterial stiffness measured by cardiac MRI during the HDT phase in healthy subjects26. Surprisingly, another study using the same study cohort found no differences in brachial-femoral pulse wave velocity, but a tendency for an increase of the aortic cross-sectional area was evident suggesting increased vascular filling39. The observed vascular changes returned to baseline during the 4 days of recovery suggesting functional mechanisms underlying arterial stiffening in this cohort26,39. Of note, no sex effect was observed in these two studies potentially due to small sample size26,39. The timing interval of pulse transition time was also decreased in healthy male subjects after 60 day HDT protocol suggesting arterial stiffening40. In contrast, increased aortic stiffening measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity did not completely recover after 1 month of head-down bed rest in healthy men without cardiovascular risk41. Since arterial stiffness may increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease, understanding the mechanisms leading to arterial stiffening in response to spaceflight may facilitate the development of countermeasures that can improve the cardiovascular health of astronauts post-flight. The mechanisms of increased arterial stiffness due to microgravity are not well understood. It has been suggested that arterial stiffness could be a compensatory mechanism necessary to maintain cardiac output in response to orthostatic stress after spaceflight26. Although we have not directly measured total peripheral resistance, the increased stiffness in females was associated with maintained cardiac output and stroke volume after HLU. In addition, although there was a significant increase in ejection fraction in females after HLU, the ejection fraction values were within the normal range for rats at this age. The significance of these findings needs further investigation by examining the presence of subclinical left ventricle systolic dysfunction using more advanced features of strain rate imaging42. In contrast, we found a significant increase in E/E’ ratio in female rats after HLU suggesting diastolic dysfunction. These data are in agreement with recent studies including the Framingham Heart Study that reported correlations of arterial stiffness with left ventricular diastolic function43–45. It is possible that increased aortic stiffness leads to left ventricular hypertrophy followed by lower filling pressure and reduced coronary flow45. Thus, the increased E/E’ ratio in females after HLU in addition to greater left common carotid artery stiffness in our study may indirectly suggest the reduction of left ventricle filling pressure. Arterial stiffness, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were greater in women versus men in the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study, where the authors suggested that higher arterial stiffness may contribute to higher susceptibility of women to develop heart failure with normal ejection fraction46. The return of cardiovascular system to normal functioning after spaceflight may be delayed by lower vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries in those who developed arterial stiffness emphasizing the need for longitudinal assessment of sex-specific risk of cardiovascular events in astronauts with arterial stiffness following long-term spaceflights47,48. In addition, other hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure can influence the extent of arterial stiffness. Higher blood pressures were reported in male SD or male Wistar rats compared to controls after 14 days of HLU49,50. Therefore, it is possible that the response of blood pressure after HLU was different in male versus female SD rats contributing to differences in PWV. Our future studies will incorporate blood pressure measurements during HLU exposure to establish the interactions of estrogen receptors and arterial hemodynamics. Changes in mechanical forces (shear stress and pressure) or ECM composition are important for the regulation of aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) support of the arterial compliance and the response of VSMC to increases in blood volume or pressure51. We investigated the alterations in ECM components as a potential contributor to increased PWV. Male rats had greater expression of aortic α smooth muscle actin and myosin, however no differences in these cytoskeletal elements were detected in either female or male rats after HLU. In contrast, lower expression of α smooth muscle actin with potential switch to synthetic phenotype was reported in cerebral arteries suggesting vessel-specific alterations in cytoskeleton in response to HLU52. An increase in collagen cross-linking and deposition and decrease in elastin content may also lead to increased aortic stiffness and lower arterial compliance. Our findings reveal no differences in collagen content after 14 days of HLU. These data are consistent with reports demonstrating that structural remodeling may not be the primary mechanism leading to arterial stiffness in astronauts after spaceflights25 suggesting that other factors such as systemic (neurohumoral) or local endothelial factors may have an impact on the development of arterial stiffness5,23. However, others reported that HLU resulted in increased deposition of extracellular collagen in the basilar artery but not femoral artery in rats53. The hydroxyproline content as a measure of collagen content was increased in male Wistar rats, however collagen subtype composition was not different between control and HLU-exposed rats in this cohort23. These studies suggest that hypertrophic response to HLU is vascular bed specific. Furthermore, our data revealed no differences in fiber characteristics including alignment, straightness, length, or width suggesting that 14-day exposure to HLU does not induces changes in collagen fiber characteristics in SD rats. This was a surprising finding considering a possibility of an increased stress on collagen fibers and their potential gradual strengthening under pressure due to HLU54. Increased stiffness of collagen fibers may also affect smooth muscle cell phenotype, cell proliferation, or cause downregulation of vascular contractility55,56. Increased fiber angle may indicate greater alignment between smooth muscle fibers potentially contributing to increased stiffness57. Furthermore, highly dense and stiff matrices can promote crosstalk between estrogen receptors and prolactin supporting the hypothesis that changes of the physical environment, such as in microgravity, can be affected by estrogen receptors58. Unlike collagen, another major ECM protein, elastin, is responsible for elasticity, reversible expansion and relaxation of large arteries59. Despite elastin being a critical component of the aorta’s ability to deform under stress, few studies have investigated elastin in response to HLU exposure. No statistically relevant differences in elastin expression or collagen-to-elastin ratio were found in either female or male rats after HLU exposure. However, the female HLU group had a wide standard deviation which consisted of several subjects having decreased elastin expression after HLU exposure compared to the mean. For those individuals, the cause of decreased elastin after HLU exposure is unclear. Elastin in the aorta could decrease with age or in the setting of arterial stiffness. However, similar to our study, aortic elastin content was not altered in male Wistar rats after HLU23. Sex differences in the cardiovascular system may depend in part on the levels of sex hormone receptors and signaling induced by their actions. In non-pregnant female mice, aortic PWV was reported to be lower in estrus cycle compared with diestrus suggesting that the development of vascular stiffening may in part be influenced by the levels of ovarian hormones60. Indeed, our preliminary data agrees with previous reports suggesting that the removal of sex hormones via ovariectomy increases arterial stiffening in the female rats. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show that HLU did not change PWV in aorta or carotid artery of ovariectomized rats (Fig. S4). Similarly, ovariectomy did not exacerbate muscle loss in Fisher female rats during the exposure to either simulated microgravity or partial-gravity environments61. These data together with our findings suggest that the activation of local vascular estrogen receptors may have a greater impact on the development of arterial stiffness after HLU than changes in the ovarian hormones. Furthermore, arterial stiffness is associated with genetic variants of estrogen receptor subtypes suggesting a link between arterial stiffness and estrogen receptors expression62. Although the data on the status of estrogen receptors in response to spaceflight or microgravity analogs are limited, Holets et al. reported a downregulation of estrogen receptor α mRNA and protein in the uterus and ovary of mice after the spaceflight63. However, to our knowledge the response of GPER to HLU in the aorta or other tissues was not yet been considered particularly in the context of sex differences. GPER is a membrane-bound estrogen receptor with protective actions in the cardiovascular system64. GPER is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body of both sexes65. Our data showed sex differences in aortic GPER levels between unexposed animals. However, this difference was lost when GPER decreased in the females after HLU. In addition, our data revealed a strong relationship between aortic pulse-wave velocity and GPER in males. In agreement with previous reports, G1 administration reduced aortic pulse-wave velocity demonstrating a protective role of GPER activation against arterial stiffening66–71. Recent preclinical studies highlighted a protective role of GPER in the regulation of blood pressure, diastolic function, vascular reactivity, arterial stiffness, and aortic remodeling66–71. In contrast, the knockout of GPER in male mice increased endothelial prostanoid-mediated vasoconstriction of the thoracic aorta without changing eNOS mRNA levels or eNOS activity72. In addition, the intracarotid pulse wave velocities were similar between male and female GPER knockout mice, however the response to angiotensin II showed greater increases in elastin and smooth muscle but less collagen deposition in male GPER knockout mice versus females revealing sex differences in vascular remodeling67. Aortic pulse-wave velocity in HLU males was also correlated with heart weight. Indeed, heart weight was lower in male SD after HLU, but did not change in females. The mechanisms and consequences of reduced heart weight in SD HLU male rats are unknown, while cardiac atrophy was suggested to contribute to the reductions in cardiac function after spaceflight18. Furthermore, although estrogen has an established role in the regulation of adiposity, the effect of GPER deletion on body weight revealed contrasting results with studies reporting increased or decreased body weight in GPER knockout mice versus control counterparts73,74. Our data showed no changes in body weight, fat mass or lean mass in females after HLU, however similar to other reports, HLU decreased lean body mass in male SD rats75. In addition, there was strong correlation between body weight and lean body mass in both sexes. These changes appeared to be unrelated to GPER as no relationship between lean mass and GPER was detected. Fat mass however was not different among studied groups potentially due to small number of subjects used for this analysis which led to large data variability in female controls and male subjects. Future studies using GPER knockout mice of both sexes could provide more insight on the role of GPER in vascular adaptations to HLU. Since GPER actions has been linked to antioxidant effects in cardiovascular system65,76, we tested the levels of oxidative stress markers in the aorta of female versus male rats following HLU. Our data showed increased levels of DNA damage marker 8-OHdG in the aorta of HLU females but not in male rats suggesting increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, the absence of differences in the levels of lipid peroxidation marker 4-HNE suggests a more pronounced DNA damage77. In agreement, a 72-h exposure to simulated microgravity through a rotary cell culture system resulted in increased expression of the DNA damage markers in human promyelocytic leukemia cells78. Previous reports also demonstrated increased circulating levels of 8-OHdG in rats after HLU, in human patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as in patients with diabetes where higher 8-OHdG was positively correlated with PWV79–81. Lower levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase were reported in skeletal muscle of male SD rats after 28 days of HLU suggesting that lower activity of antioxidant enzymes may also contribute to the increase of superoxide levels after HLU82. The correlations of 8-OHdG with collagen and to a lesser degree with elastin in our study suggest that long-term exposure to oxidative stress could promote ECM remodeling and further exacerbate aortic stiffening in response to HLU83. Furthermore, the reduction of pulse wave velocity by G1 administration in HLU females was accompanied by decreased 8-OHdG suggesting that the protective actions of GPER may involve reduction of vascular oxidative stress70. These data agree with previous reports demonstrating antioxidant effects of GPER activation in various tissues including aorta of hypertensive rats where 2-week administration of G1 reduced lipid peroxidation68. Although the major strength of our studies was a comparison between female and male SD rat responses to HLU, G1 treatment experiments were performed only in female rats, thus sex specific responses to G1 were not established; thus, future studies should also consider the response of male SD subjects to G1 activation in the setting of HLU. A crosstalk between GPER and PPARγ in anti-inflammatory protection against global cerebral ischemia has been suggested in ovariectomized rats84. PPARγ is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in estrogen-based protection of the cardiovascular and renal systems85,86. PPARγ is also closely linked to cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction and therefore has the potential for being targeted by HLU which induces cardiovascular changes similar to aging or menopause87. Our data revealed lower PPARγ levels in the aorta of female rats in response to HLU88, as well as a correlation of PPARγ with collagen content in HLU aortas. Considering the role of PPARγ in the regulation of vasodilation, vascular redox state, bioavailability of nitric oxide, as well as regulation of VSMC stiffness89, our data implies that lower PPARγ may result in reduced protection against arterial stiffness caused by the exposure to HLU. Indeed, the activation of PPARγ by pioglitazone attenuated arterial stiffness and obesity-induced elastin fiber fragmentation in perivascular adipose tissue of diabetic mice suggesting that protective effects of PPARγ against arterial stiffening may involve ECM remodeling mechanisms90. Furthermore, we investigated the expression patterns of CD68-positive macrophage/monocytes, eNOS and COX-2 in the aorta after HLU. The eNOS regulation in the vasculature in response to HLU may depend on the vascular bed or the length of the exposure47,91. Lower nitric oxide availability due to formation of peroxynitrite has been suggested as a contributing factor to superoxide production in vasculature after HLU92. However, our data revealed no differences in eNOS or COX-2 among studied groups. Future studies will assess nitric oxide bioavailability and aortic vascular reactivity in response to nitric oxide and COX-2 inhibition to determine if functional vasodilatory responses are altered in female rats after HLU. Although no differences in eNOS levels were detected in male aortas, there was a strong correlation between eNOS and ECM in male SD suggesting a potential influence of eNOS on ECM remodeling. However, a small sample size in the analysis of immunostaining of various vascular markers or G1 treatment potentially limited our ability to detect significant effects between study groups. The use of multivariate analysis of data provided additional insights on potential relationships between studied variables; thus, strengthening the conclusions of this study. Finally, the mechanisms and long-term consequences of arterial stiffness developed in response to spaceflight are not well understood. The present study demonstrated sex differences in the development of arterial stiffening in SD rats exposed to simulated microgravity. Although the cellular mechanisms of the interaction between microgravity, the cardiovascular system and estrogen receptors in response to HLU need further investigation, our study revealed that lower GPER in the females contributes to the development of arterial stiffness during HLU, and that the SD rat is a suitable model to study these interactions. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis identified several significant relationships between studied variables based on sex or the exposure to HLU that could be explored in future studies focused on the development of destiffening agents as a countermeasure for arterial stiffness.Methods Animals The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (A21-039). Female and male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). All rats were housed at 12:12-h light-dark cycle, a constant room temperature and humidity. A standard rodent chow (Lab Diet 5P00 - Prolab RMH 3000, PMI Nutrition International, INC, Brentwood, MO) and water were given ad libitum throughout the experimental protocols.Study timeline Socially and sexually mature female and male SD rats at 20 weeks of age were randomly assigned to study groups. The first experimental set included the following animals: female control (F), female HLU (F HLU), male control (M), or male HLU (M HLU) (n = 5–8 in each group). HLU groups underwent hindlimb unloading for 14 days93. Control groups were exposed to the same cages for a 14-day period. On the morning of day 14, animals were imaged with ultrasound followed by EchoMRI, and then sacrificed to collect tissues. Additional experimental set included two groups of HLU female rats that underwent either treatment with G1, a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) agonist (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or vehicle (n = 4 in each group). G1 was dissolved in 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a dose of 100 μg/kg/day. G1 or vehicle was delivered via osmotic minipumps to female HLU rats for 3 weeks (model 2ML2; Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA)94. Pumps were implanted subcutaneously on the back of the rat’s neck 1-week prior to HLU exposure and continued for 2 weeks during the HLU exposure. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and injury markers were analyzed at the end of the 3-week treatment with G1.Hindlimb unloading (HLU) To determine the effects of microgravity, 20-week-old male and female SD rats were suspended by the tail via HLU for 14 days resulting in a head-down body angle of 30–35 degrees. Age-matched, non-suspended controls remained in similar cages93. Animals were monitored for signs of distress by monitoring food and water intake and loss of body weight throughout the exposure to HLU.Ultrasound assessment of arterial stiffness Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5%) and placed on a temperature-controlled platform. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate were monitored throughout the imaging protocol. Hair was removed from the thoracic and neck areas of rats with a depilatory cream prior to imaging. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the aortic arch and common carotid arteries were determined in male and female rats using a MS250 transducer and high-resolution ultrasound imaging system Vevo 2100 LAZR (FujiFilm, VisualSonics). MS250 transducer operates at a frequency of 13–24 MHz and axial resolution of 75/165. The PWV of the aortic arch and carotid arteries was measured by the following equation: the D (mm), distance from ascending to descending artery measured with tracing tool (Vevo Lab software), divided by time interval, Δt, which represent the difference between t2 and t1 (ms). Time intervals between the R-wave of the ECG to the foot of the Doppler waveforms were averaged over at least three cardiac cycles. The foot of the Doppler waveform was defined manually as the intersection between the baseline and the beginning of the ascending or descending aortic velocity, or proximal and distal segments of the common carotid artery. The pulse-transit time in the aortic arch was calculated by subtracting the mean ascending aorta (t1) time interval from the mean descending aorta (t2) time interval. For common carotid arteries, t1 time interval was recorded from the proximal portion of the artery and t2 time interval was recorded from distal portion of the artery. All ultrasound measurements were done by one operator, blinded to the experimental groups.Ultrasound assessment of diastolic function Left ventricle M-mode images were recorded in the short-axis parasternal view. The ejection fraction (EF) was calculated as %EF = ((left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) − left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV)/LVEDV) × 100. Stroke volume (SV) was determined as SV = (LVEDV − LVESV) µl. Cardiac output (CO) was determined as cardiac output (CO) = heart rate (HR) × SV/1000 ml/min. Mitral inflow measurements of early- (Emax) and late (Amax) filling velocities were acquired from an apical four-chamber heart orientation using pulsed wave Doppler with the sample volume placed at the tips of mitral leaflets. The mitral valve septal annular velocities (E′) were also assessed by Doppler tissue imaging from the four-chamber view69. A ratio of E/E’ was computed as a measure of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Greater E/E’ suggests higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. All measured and calculated systolic and diastolic indices are represented as the average of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles.Body composition EchoMRITM Analyzer was used to determine the total body composition in studied groups. Briefly, animal was placed in a clear holder, and then inserted into the EchoMRI Analyzer without anesthesia. Each animal was scanned three times in a row and the average total body fat and lean mass were recorded.Collagen content Aortas were fixed in formalin and ethanol followed by the paraffin-embedding. Aortic sections were cut at thickness of 5 µm. Collagen content was determined by Masson’s trichrome staining (Abcam ab150686). Using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT equipped with NDP.scan and NDP.view, slides containing stained aortic sections were imaged at ×20 magnification. Using Adobe Photoshop 7.0, each slide was quantified for the total area of collagen deposition (red, orange, yellow, or green) and reported as a collagen-to-tissue ratio.Collagen fiber properties Five µm sections were stained with Picrosirius red (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; assay components Cat#: 197378-100G; P6744-16A; 36-554-8) to assess collagen fiber properties. Slides were imaged using polarized light, and 90 × 90 µm representative regions of interest (ROIs) were selected around aortic arch to determine collagen fiber bundling, length, width, straightness, and alignment. Collagen bundling was assessed using an R script that binned hue values in each ROI into red, orange, yellow, and green, in order of high to low collagen bundling15. Data was presented as a ratio of the binned values to the total number of pixels binned. Collagen fiber length, width, and straightness were determined through CT-FIRE software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, The University of Wisconsin-Madison) using default settings95. Coefficient of alignment was determined through CurveAlign software (Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation, The University of Wisconsin-Madison), using default settings95.Smooth muscle fiber characterization Extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics were analyzed using MATLAB and the CT-FIRE algorithm to assess fiber straightness, fiber length, and fiber width. Fiber angle was quantified at the individual fiber level. CT-FIRE excludes empty pixels prior to analysis. Quantification of fibers was done using CT-FIRE and Curve Align scripts15.Elastin fiber content Verhoeff’s stain (American MasterTech; Cat#: KTVEL) was used to quantify elastin content in aortic sections using the manufacturer’s protocol. The staining intensity in the tunica media layer of the aorta was normalized to the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of 255 of the red, green, and blue intensity (RGB) component and reported as relative intensity units96.Morphological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin followed by 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 µm sections. Immunostaining was performed using the avidin biotin complex (ABC) method with 0.1% diaminobenzene solution used as the chromogen as previously described. Antigen retrieval treatment with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was applied at 90–95 °C for 30 min. Non-specific binding was blocked in a buffer containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 30 min. Aortic sections were incubated with goat anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA; Cat#: NB300-978), rabbit anti-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 (1:500 dilution; Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat#: ab53219), rabbit anti-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; 1:10,000 dilution; Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat#: ab46545), rabbit anti-p47 phox (1:400 dilution; LifeSpan BioSciences, Shirley, MA, USA; Cat#: LS-C331296), mouse anti-8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; 1:100 dilution; JaICA, Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan; Cat#: MOG-020P), rabbit anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, 1:200 dilution; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Cat#: 160126), mouse anti-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, 1:100 dilution; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Cat#: 610297), mouse anti-macrophages/monocytes antibody, clone ED-1/CD68 (1:200 dilution; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA; Cat#: MAB1435), rabbit anti-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ; 1:1200 dilution; Biorbyt, LLC, Durham, NC, USA; Cat#: orb11291), rabbit anti-GPER (1:200 dilution; Biorbyt, LLC, Durham, NC, USA; Cat#: orb10740) and secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit, mouse or goat antibodies (1:500 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0 HT utilizing NDP.scan and NDP.view as the imaging software at ×20 magnification. Images were analyzed in four fields per aortic cross-section using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 by the investigator blinded to the experimental groups. The staining was normalized to the intensity of the background and to the maximal value of the RGB component and reported as relative intensity units as described96.Statistics Groups were compared using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni post hoc tests (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significantly different. All data were presented as mean ± SEM.Discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis The microgravity and sex discrete correlate summation (DCS) analysis is designed to create an indexed network for the visualization of binary interaction of variables with large differences in sex-wise correlations given this model of microgravitational challenge and a microgravitational-wise correlations independent of sex. DCS analysis was performed on the 18 variables (Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE, % Lean mass AVE, COX-2, eNOS, GPER, PPARγ, VSMC actin, 8-OHdG, p47phox, TC, VVG, Carotid PWV, Aorta PWV, CF length, CF straightness). Briefly, absolute values of both the log correlation ratios (logcr) of male versus female (for control and HLU groups, log(malep/femalep)) and the log correlation ratios of HLU versus control (for female and male groups, log(HLUp/controlp)) were calculated for each variable combination97. To find large differences between the sex-wise and microgravity-wise correlations (153 combinations from each DCS analysis), we performed these analyses to isolate correlations of interest; 68 combinations (|logcr| ≥ 0.8) were further evaluated after tabulating and indexing by DCS; |logcr| values range from 0.8 to 4.42 or 6.3-fold to 27,000-fold change in p values. For network visualization purposes 8-OHdG and p47phox were combined into an oxidative stress node, VSMC actin, TC, VVG, CF length and CF straightness were combined into an extracellular matrix composition node and Heart/TL, Kidney/TL, BW, % Fat AVE and % Lean mass AVE were combined into a body composition node. The 68 above |logcr| ≥ 0.8 edges were plotted with the corresponding variable nodes in Fig. 10. Nodes and edges also illustrated in Tables 2 and 3. All calculations were performed in Excel (Microsoft Corp., WA), Prism (GraphPad Software, MA) was used for statistical analyses and plotting data in figures; Cytoscape was used for network generation.Supplementary information Supplementary material (232.4KB, pdf) Acknowledgements These studies were supported by the WFUSM Cardiovascular Sciences Center Pilot Award to L.M.Y., R.

    "abstract": "Abstract Space biology and health data are critical for the success of deep space missions and sustainable human presence off-world. At the core of effectively managing biomedical risks is the commitment to open science principles, which ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reproducible and maximally open. The 2021 integration of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive with GeneLab to establish the NASA Open Science Data Repository significantly enhanced access to a wide range of life sciences, biomedical-clinical and mission telemetry data alongside existing ‘omics data from GeneLab. This paper describes the new database, its architecture and new data streams supporting diverse data types and enhancing data submission, retrieval and analysis. Features include the biological data management environment for improved data submission, a new user interface, controlled data access, an enhanced API and comprehensive public visualization tools for environmental telemetry, radiation dosimetry data and ‘omics analyses. By fostering global collaboration through its analysis working groups and training programs, the open science data repository promotes widespread engagement in space biology, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in research. It supports the global scientific community in advancing our understanding of spaceflight's impact on biological systems, ensuring humans will thrive in future deep space missions.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The fields of space biology and space health are rapidly expanding and becoming more essential as humanity embarks on missions to the Moon, Mars, and other deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit. The heightened biomedical risks and new challenges associated with deep space missions (1) necessitate the discovery of new knowledge, the development of new health countermeasures and the creation of novel ecosystems (2,3), life support systems, crop production methods, in situ biomedical research and biomedical support capabilities (4). Supporting distant and long-duration missions is our new paradigm that requires biological and health-related data to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) (5,6). Optimal data governance for public dissemination encompasses a spectrum from closed to mediated, embargoed and fully open access. Scientific reproducibility, knowledge discovery and data reuse is maximized when data are both FAIR and open (7). For the past decade, NASA GeneLab ‘omics database has played the leading role in collecting, curating, processing and organizing space biology data (8), catalyzing numerous biological discoveries. Noteworthy publications that have utilized GeneLab include studies on mitochondrial dysfunction across species (9), short duration spaceflight on human health (10), kidney dysfunction (11), endocrinology (12), carbon dioxide impact (13), skin health (14), liver lipid dysregulation (15) and changes in the gut microbiome (16). Such pioneering work highlighted the need for all space biomedical data beyond molecular ‘omics to also be maximally open access and FAIR. Consequently in 2021, the integration (17) of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) with the GeneLab database culminated in the creation of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/). Today, OSDR combines ‘omics with non-omics life sciences space-related data that span physiological, phenotypic, bioimaging, behavioral, clinical, environmental telemetry, hardware data and more. This integration involved ALSDA transforming to standardize, curate and make all its collected data more FAIR and open (7,17). This paper describes the new OSDR database architecture and features that enable the submission, hosting, retrieval and analysis of diverse data types, including both ‘omics and non-omics, from spaceflight to analog missions. We review the new biological data management environment (BDME), which supports the submission of both ‘omics and non-omics data in a standardized format. We introduce the new OSDR database layout, which includes access to additional experimental, payload and mission-specific information and telemetry data associated with each study. We also describe the new controlled data access feature that mediates the sharing of sensitive commercial astronaut data, making data as open as possible and as close as necessary. The generation of novel spaceflight data by the GeneLab Sample Processing Laboratory (SPL) is described, along with the expansion of GeneLab's standardized data processing pipelines and available processed data products. Access to all metadata and data hosted on OSDR is provided by the expanded Application Programming Interface (API) and Registry of Open Data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We also review the rich set of visualization tools available to easily analyze and interpret OSDR data, further democratizing these data. We also present user roadmap examples for the public to engage in spaceflight biomedical sciences leveraging OSDR. Lastly, we introduce the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) and training initiatives that enhance engagement with space-relevant data and support a robust and active space biology and space health research community.",

    "discussion": "Discussion and future directions The successful expansion of human life into deep space hinges on profound advancements in our understanding of space biology and the critical biomedical responses and health systems developed for long-duration and long-distance spaceflight missions. Centralizing and standardizing data, alongside the strategic reuse of tissues, are pivotal for maximizing the value extracted from every piece of available data and tissue. However, a meta-analysis of the field of space medicine and space life sciences by Bellomo et al. reviewed 1215 open-access articles and found that only a third shared their data. Analysis code was almost never shared, and practically no researchers used registered assay methodology standards (82). Especially as humanity nears returning to the Moon, this finding underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift towards open science in space biology and aerospace medicine, an essential shift required to develop health countermeasures and conduct space biological research. Responding to this need and leveraging the pioneering work of GeneLab (8), OSDR has rapidly expanded as a public resource to foster extensive engagement in spaceflight science, discovery, research, and development. This expansion has attracted tens of thousands of participants globally, especially via the AWG, and makes all relevant life sciences data from space experiments maximally open access and of high quality. Furthermore, ESA has recently adopted OSDR as its default portal for all life sciences ‘omics data, marking a significant international endorsement of OSDR standards. This collaboration is poised to augment OSDR with hundreds of terabytes of ‘omics data soon, enhancing the repository's utility and scope. Commercial astronauts are also actively participating in the space biology ecosystem by securely sharing their sensitive data through the OSDR DAR portal (10,18). Such practices not only show a shared commitment to centralizing valuable datasets between the scientific community and commercial space sectors but also enhance our ability to compare human, animal, microbial, plant and other data to deepen our understanding of space biology. Acknowledging the limitations of traditional statistical methods (83), OSDR is also broadening its analytical range to include AI/ML technologies (4,84). In partnership with researchers from UC San Francisco, OSDR is integrating a knowledge graph analysis tool known as 'SPOKE' (Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine) into its visualization-analysis portal. This integration aims to enable users to identify symptoms, diseases, and potential therapeutic targets by mining and comparing datasets, enhancing the utility of OSDR for advanced data-driven discoveries (85–87). OSDR is continuously refining its systems to provide better access and improved tools. The OSDR API will continue evolving to better serve users, with plans to develop more visualization tools for data analytics, including single-cell sequencing, metagenomics and physio-phenotypic-bioimaging data. AI/ML enhancements will streamline data submission, and an OSDR chatbot is being developed to help users discover and interpret datasets more easily. To conclude, as humanity has entered the ‘Second Space Age’ (88), a central goal for the future of OSDR has evolved from FAIR data and metadata to the FAIREST principles, standing for more Engagement, more Social connections, and more Trust in its quality and stewardship (89). As the commercial spaceflight industry expands, OSDR is poised to facilitate broader public access to life science and biomedical data. As a leading force in open science, OSDR empowers the global community to actively engage in space exploration and discovery, aligning directly with NASA’s ambitious goals for the ‘Moon to Mars’ (90) and Artemis campaigns.",

Copyright notice ID: 11701653 PMID: 39558178 Abstract Space biology and health data are critical for the success of deep space missions and sustainable human presence off-world. At the core of effectively managing biomedical risks is the commitment to open science principles, which ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reproducible and maximally open. The 2021 integration of the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive with GeneLab to establish the NASA Open Science Data Repository significantly enhanced access to a wide range of life sciences, biomedical-clinical and mission telemetry data alongside existing ‘omics data from GeneLab. This paper describes the new database, its architecture and new data streams supporting diverse data types and enhancing data submission, retrieval and analysis. Features include the biological data management environment for improved data submission, a new user interface, controlled data access, an enhanced API and comprehensive public visualization tools for environmental telemetry, radiation dosimetry data and ‘omics analyses. By fostering global collaboration through its analysis working groups and training programs, the open science data repository promotes widespread engagement in space biology, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in research. It supports the global scientific community in advancing our understanding of spaceflight's impact on biological systems, ensuring humans will thrive in future deep space missions.Graphical Abstract Graphical Abstract. Open in a new tabIntroduction The fields of space biology and space health are rapidly expanding and becoming more essential as humanity embarks on missions to the Moon, Mars, and other deep space missions beyond low Earth orbit. The heightened biomedical risks and new challenges associated with deep space missions (1) necessitate the discovery of new knowledge, the development of new health countermeasures and the creation of novel ecosystems (2,3), life support systems, crop production methods, in situ biomedical research and biomedical support capabilities (4). Supporting distant and long-duration missions is our new paradigm that requires biological and health-related data to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) (5,6). Optimal data governance for public dissemination encompasses a spectrum from closed to mediated, embargoed and fully open access. Scientific reproducibility, knowledge discovery and data reuse is maximized when data are both FAIR and open (7). For the past decade, NASA GeneLab ‘omics database has played the leading role in collecting, curating, processing and organizing space biology data (8), catalyzing numerous biological discoveries. Noteworthy publications that have utilized GeneLab include studies on mitochondrial dysfunction across species (9), short duration spaceflight on human health (10), kidney dysfunction (11), endocrinology (12), carbon dioxide impact (13), skin health (14), liver lipid dysregulation (15) and changes in the gut microbiome (16). Such pioneering work highlighted the need for all space biomedical data beyond molecular ‘omics to also be maximally open access and FAIR. Consequently in 2021, the integration (17) of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) with the GeneLab database culminated in the creation of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://www.nasa.gov/osdr/). Today, OSDR combines ‘omics with non-omics life sciences space-related data that span physiological, phenotypic, bioimaging, behavioral, clinical, environmental telemetry, hardware data and more. This integration involved ALSDA transforming to standardize, curate and make all its collected data more FAIR and open (7,17). This paper describes the new OSDR database architecture and features that enable the submission, hosting, retrieval and analysis of diverse data types, including both ‘omics and non-omics, from spaceflight to analog missions. We review the new biological data management environment (BDME), which supports the submission of both ‘omics and non-omics data in a standardized format. We introduce the new OSDR database layout, which includes access to additional experimental, payload and mission-specific information and telemetry data associated with each study. We also describe the new controlled data access feature that mediates the sharing of sensitive commercial astronaut data, making data as open as possible and as close as necessary. The generation of novel spaceflight data by the GeneLab Sample Processing Laboratory (SPL) is described, along with the expansion of GeneLab's standardized data processing pipelines and available processed data products. Access to all metadata and data hosted on OSDR is provided by the expanded Application Programming Interface (API) and Registry of Open Data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We also review the rich set of visualization tools available to easily analyze and interpret OSDR data, further democratizing these data. We also present user roadmap examples for the public to engage in spaceflight biomedical sciences leveraging OSDR. Lastly, we introduce the OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) and training initiatives that enhance engagement with space-relevant data and support a robust and active space biology and space health research community.Expanded database architecture and new features Database content and use OSDR champions data stewardship to enable all humanity to participate in discovery and exploration by making data more equitable and accessible to all (18). As of October 2024, OSDR houses over 500 studies, including close to 1000 spaceflight or space-analog datasets, with data from over 80 different assays, encompassing both ‘omics and physiological/phenotypic assays (Figure 1). OSDR is species-agnostic, offering access to a diverse range of studies from rodents to plants, microbes and humans—including data from commercial astronauts connected to the Inspiration 4 SpaceX mission (10). The data hosted on OSDR are linked to 105 original peer-reviewed scientific publications and have enabled 92 publications, representing an 88% return on investment (ROI), measured by the number of enabled publications versus primary publications (Figure 1). This indicates that the ROI grows faster than the number of primary publications because the data in OSDR have led to a significantly higher number of new publications, suggesting that each dataset submitted to OSDR has the potential to generate multiple follow-up studies and accelerate research output. The repository is also currently curating data from other space agencies and companies such as the European Space Agency (ESA), providing studies on human head-down bed rest, human dry immersion, model organisms exposed to simulated space radiation and other model organisms flown on the International Space Station (ISS). The demand for OSDR to ingest commercial human data has been surging, highlighting its unique role in the space biology ecosystem. Not only does OSDR promote greater FAIR/Open access to data, but it also enables comparisons across hundreds of datasets, spanning different species and various missions/experiments. This capability greatly enhances the scientific value of space exploration by enriching the biomedical insights gained from shared data. Figure 1. Open in a new tab OSDR metrics. Overview of studies hosted on OSDR as of October 2024, including the total number of international studies, percent of total datasets for each ‘omics and each phenotypic-physiological measurement type, percent of total studies for each organism and the ROI measured by the number of enabled publications versus primary publications that use OSDR datasets.Data management workflow To increase the reusability and accessibility of biological data from space-relevant experiments and data types and to improve data submission planning, the original GeneLab submission portal was expanded into the BDME. Key features such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and the ISA framework (Investigation, Study, Assay) (19,20) remain integral to the BDME. The submission portal now has the capability to collect all types of data-metadata, encompassing not just ‘omics but all life science and biomedical assays. The enhanced BDME tools are designed to ease the submission process, enabling self-curation with established metadata and data standards through a new user-friendly interface and a streamlined workflow. The BDME’s latest updates support ongoing data and metadata submission throughout research, avoiding end-of-grant rushes that compromise data quality, while preserving data privacy. BDME introduces a collaborative workspace, enabling users to privately share, organize and store files during their experiments. The collaborative workspace provides users a new solution for transferring large data files quickly and securely, with the File Application for Seamless Transfer to/from the Workspace (FASTWork). FASTWork ensures the integrity of data transfers by automatically resuming the process if interrupted due to connectivity issues or computer downtime. This functionality is accessible through both a command-line interface and a downloadable application, making it versatile for various user preferences and technical environments. Users can also add collaborators and specify permissions and roles such as editors, supervisors and submitters, enhancing the collaborative and efficient management of research data. Additionally, a private link feature lets researchers securely share dataset previews with peer reviewers and editors. The Research Data Submission Agreement (RDSA), now a requirement under the NASA Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division's Scientific Data Management Policy (https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/data/), guides NASA investigators in outlining data products, assays, tissues and submission timelines. The information captured in the RDSA generates a unique Experiment page, automatically populating the data to reduce further input from principal investigators (PIs), thus significantly lowering the burden of data entry and ensuring metadata richness—a key FAIR requirement. Importantly, aside from RDSA-directed NASA BPS policy timelines, there is no set timeframe for data release from submission to public availability on OSDR, providing submitters control over their data's accessibility. Since there is no required timeframe for public release after data submission, submitters are encouraged to begin the submission process as early as possible. Starting early helps researchers meticulously collect and standardize their metadata throughout their experiments and prevents a heavy data submission workload at the end of their grant. This ensures ample time to gather complete metadata, resulting in higher quality and more comprehensive curation records, ultimately streamlining the submission process.New data collections Integrating ALSDA data into OSDR required developing new data schemas to manage diverse records such as experiments, biospecimens, hardware, payload and mission data. To achieve this, OSDR expanded on GeneLab's existing database to create a schema linking studies with their corresponding reference data collections. To support the legacy ALSDA data structure used for the past 40 + years and meet new requirements, OSDR introduces a workflow based on a new data and metadata hierarchy (Figures 2 and 3). This new system offers two distinct routes for data submission, one for NASA-funded data (Figure 2), and one for non-NASA funded data (Figure 3). For NASA-funded PIs, the process begins with the RDSA, which is the initial step and first tier of submission. RDSAs capture comprehensive grant-level information, organism metadata and anticipated datasets for submission (Figure 2). The second tier in OSDR’s data management workflow describes all Experiments performed with grant funds, and establishes connections between individual investigations, linking them to related study collection, and reference data collections (Figure 2). The third-tier guides submitters through the data submission process, offering options for either a structured, guided submission or independent data and metadata entry for each dataset within a study (Figure 2). This tier is the point of entry for non-NASA PIs who do not need to have a NASA investigation identifier (Figure 3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab NASA funded PI data and metadata hierarchy. The RDSA is for NASA-funded PIs and describes the experiment(s) conducted with the associated grant funds. Each experiment receives a unique identifier (e.g. OS-636) and is linked to respective Reference data and studies. Reference data records associated with each experiment include payload (e.g. BRIC-16), mission (e.g. STS-131), hardware (e.g. BRIC-PDFU) and subject (e.g. Cress, mouse ear). Each study associated with an experiment has a unique identifier (e.g. OSD-44 and OSD-121). Most studies are categorized based on organism and tissue type, although plant studies are distinguished based solely on organism as shown here. Each study is further categorized between ‘omics and phenotypic-physiological datasets. GLDS includes all ‘omics data and LSDS contains all phenotypic-physiological data derived from the respective study.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Non-NASA funded PI data and metadata hierarchy. The point of entry for non-NASA PIs begins at the study level. Most studies are categorized based on organism and tissue type, although plant studies are distinguished based solely on organism. Each study can maintain links to respective reference data when applicable. Reference data records associated with each study can include payload (e.g. Inspiration4 Crew), mission (e.g. SpaceX Inspiration4), subject (e.g. Human) and/or hardware (not included in this study). Each study has a unique identifier (e.g. OSD-630, OSD-569, OSD-656). Each study is further categorized between ‘omics and phenotypic-physiological datasets. GLDS includes all ‘omics data and LSDS contains all phenotypic-physiological data derived from the respective study.As illustrated in Figure 2, OSDR utilizes persistent identifiers throughout the hierarchy of its data schema. Specifically, NASA investigators are assigned a unique identifier for each RDSA (e.g. RDSA-563) and experiment (e.g. OS-636; OS = Open Science experiment), while all data submitters receive a unique study identifier (e.g. OSD-44; OSD = Open Science Dataset). Within this framework, an experiment can encompass multiple studies. The majority of studies are categorized by organism and tissue type, whereas plant studies are categorized solely by organism, often encompassing multiple tissue types within a single study. Each study, in turn, may include up to two types of datasets: ‘omics assays (e.g. GLDS-44; GLDS = GeneLab Dataset) and/or physiological/phenotypic assays (e.g. LSDS-56; LSDS = Life Science Dataset) and all assays of the same type are grouped under a single unique dataset identifier. This hierarchical arrangement promotes thorough organization and enhances the ease of data management and retrieval, supporting detailed scientific research, analysis, and the understanding of study design based on the original data. These new collections are seamlessly integrated into the new OSDR repository webpage, making them findable using the OSDR repository search features, and they are also linked within each OSD study page, directly connecting studies to corresponding experiment, mission and payload pages (Figure 4). In addition to these reference data record links, each study page consists of descriptive and rich metadata, links to definitions of ontology terms and detailed sample and assay metadata that follow community standards. Users can also access all available data files structured by data level, publication information and author contact details from a study page (Figure 4). Additionally, the interface supports easy citation of datasets with a DOI, ensuring proper credit and discoverability. Figure 4. Open in a new tab An OSD study page. Screenshot of study OSD-595 showing the links to the respective experiments (OS-808), mission (SpaceX-14) and payload (MVP-Fly-01) details, sample metadata, GLDS and LSDS assay metadata and primary publications (left) and study citation (inset).The OSDR reference data collection is a new collection which reflects the integration of more than 2000 + records that span over 40 years of life sciences research migrated from the former ALSDA legacy relational database. In addition, if submitters lack the necessary reference data, OSDR’s curation team is available to assist in adding these to the repository and refining the collection. This flexibility ensures that non-NASA PIs can fully engage with the OSDR ecosystem without being hindered by NASA-specific administrative details.Controlled data access Although almost all data available in OSDR are openly accessible, sensitive human-derived data are secured through a controlled access system based on the  Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (21). This system allows storage and sharing of data in accordance with stringent agreements and policies established by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the data submitter. By adhering to these principles, OSDR facilitates the secure and responsible reuse of valuable research data, thereby advancing scientific discovery while maintaining the trust, ethics and rights of data contributors (22,23). Researchers can explore all OSDR data via the OSDR search functions, identifying studies and their access control levels. Restricted files are indicated by a lock icon and a ‘Request Access to Restricted Files’ button (Figure 5). To access restricted data, investigators must submit a controlled access data access request form, including IRB documentation, and agree to the data user agreement. The request is then verified by the OSDR Curation Team and reviewed by a Data Access Committee led by the original data submitter. Approved requests grant data access under specified terms, and investigators must sign and comply with these terms and provide progress updates. Upon project completion, all downloaded data must be deleted, and proper citations and acknowledgments are required. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Data access request (DAR) process for OSDR controlled data. The process begins by clicking the ‘Request Access to Restricted Files’ button on datasets requiring controlled access (e.g. human sequence data). Requesters must submit a data request package with IRB documentation and agree to the Data User Agreement, which is reviewed by the Data Access Committee. Upon approval, data access is granted under the specified terms. Users are required to delete downloaded data upon project completion.For example, users can request controlled data from the recent civilian astronaut mission Inspiration 4 (10,24). With this process, one can request raw data generated from whole blood and urine samples, and skin biopsies from the crew, collected at different time points before, during, and after spaceflight (i.e. OSD-569, OSD-570, OSD-571, OSD-574, OSD-575, OSD-656, OSD-687). This process facilitates secure data sharing, more diverse and inclusive access to spaceflight research, and a unique opportunity for the scientific community to unlock profound insights into the consequences of space travel on the human body without revealing sensitive data.Enhancing usability and access Data generation The opportunities for biological experimentation in space are constrained by high costs, limited crew time, and limited availability of space aboard spacecraft and habitats, which restricts the number of spaceflight studies and their sample sizes. Therefore, to maximize scientific discoveries from spaceflight missions, NASA GeneLab established the SPL, which processes preserved leftover samples to generate new data or augment existing studies on OSDR. Tissue samples provided by the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC) and the Biospecimen Sharing Program from experiments conducted on the ISS or from legacy missions (e.g. Space Shuttle-era) are processed by SPL. The resulting data, complete with detailed metadata including a description of the origin mission, are promptly made available on OSDR for public scientific analysis, enhancing data accessibility and interpretability. The SPL shares publicly accessible standard operating procedures (SOP) for various processes including tissue storage, cutting, homogenization, nucleotide extraction, library preparation, and sequencing (https://www.nasa.gov/osdr-sequencing-and-sample-processing-standard-operating-procedures/), developed in collaboration with the International Standards for Space Omics Processing consortium (https://issop.astrobotany.com/) (25). The use of consistent SOPs for data generation across distinct laboratories ensures harmonized DNA and RNA sequencing data from a wide range of biological samples, such as mammalian and plant tissues, cells and microbes. Currently, OSDR hosts over 75 OSD studies produced by GeneLab's SPL, including more than 100 ‘omics datasets from experiments involving rodent, plant, and bacterial samples. These datasets have been instrumental in 31 peer-reviewed scientific publications, thereby significantly enriching our understanding of spaceflight's impacts on terrestrial biology (15,26–29). Additionally, GeneLab provides SPL services to NASA-funded PIs, allowing them to benefit from GeneLab's expertise in processing space-flown tissues (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/forms/genelab-sequencing-services.html). This simplifies data submission to OSDR, and the resulting data harmonization enables more accurate comparisons between studies.Metadata and community consensus standards enables interoperability and reusability Within OSDR, NASA GeneLab provides assay metadata standards and templates for PIs to follow when submitting through BDME for over 40 ‘omics assays (Table 1). The metadata for these assays follows the investigation, sample, assay (ISA)-tab format, a slightly altered version to meet the needs of OSDR (19,20) and uses standardized, controlled ontologies to ensure data is maximally FAIR. In 2022, ALSDA began curating non-omics datasets (e.g. physiological and phenotypic) using a similar approach. Table 1.

Assay standards were determined using established standards in the literature and through feedback and consensus discussions from AWG SMEs.As of October 2024, 61 ALSDA assay metadata configurations have been created and implemented on OSDR. As more data types or new data types are submitted to OSDR, more are continuously being developed. These were established through virtual meetings with ∼150 subject matter experts (SMEs) and asynchronous documentation feedback within the ALSDA AWG. Each assay metadata standard was reviewed and discussed by at least three SMEs, with some of the more common assays reviewed by up to 10 experts. All OSDR assay metadata configurations with references are openly available for public review and used as metadata templates for OSDR submission (https://github.com/nasa/OSDR_Data_Curation). Table 1 shows the majority of the newly standardized phenotypic-physiological assay types available in OSDR, as well as the ‘omics assays. The curation and maximally open accessibility of these phenotypic-physiological spaceflight data have already resulted in two publications stemming from users’ data mining and reusing the data (28,30).Data repository search OSDR is equipped with expanded search features (Figure 6) that enable users to sort through studies using keyword searches and study search filters, including project type (e.g. spaceflight, ground, or high altitude), assay type (e.g. RNA sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, histomorphometry, mass spectrometry, ultrasonography, etc.), organism (e.g. rodent, human, plant, bacteria, etc.), tissue (e.g. leaf, seedlings, cells, feces, liver, retina, blood, etc.) and factors (e.g. spaceflight, ionizing radiation, age, sex, ecotype, etc.). Users can also filter searches based on data type, including study, experiment, subject, biospecimen, payload, mission, hardware and vehicle. They can specify their OSDR search to include ‘omics (GeneLab), non-omics (ALSDA) or both using the data source search filter. In addition to searching within OSDR, the data source search filter now includes federated search capabilities, allowing users to search other repositories, such as  GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds), EBI PRIDE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/), ANL MG-RAST (https://www.mg-rast.org/) and soon JGI (https://data.jgi.doe.gov/) and NMDC (https://data.microbiomedata.org/). These expanded search features enhance findability by helping users identify relevant datasets across different databases. Figure 6. Open in a new tab OSDR search features. The OSDR repository landing page is equipped with a search bar to search based on keywords or phrases (top middle). Users can refine their search based on search filters including data source (e.g. GeneLab, ALSDA or federated search in  GEO), data type (e.g. study, experiment and subject), project type (e.g. ground, spaceflight), assay type (e.g. bisulfite sequencing, behavior-gait, RNA-seq), organism (e.g. rodent, human and plant), tissue (e.g. liver, root and cells) and factor (e.g. spaceflight, ionizing radiation) (left). Search results are displayed and can be sorted by relevance, release date, accession or title (top right).Expanded API and direct cloud access The OSDR API has been enhanced to include new data types, enabling users to query the database for experiment, mission, hardware, vehicle, subject and biospecimen data (https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-public-api/). In addition, users can utilize the API to complete full-text searches, data file retrieval and metadata retrieval associated with both ‘omics and physiological-phenotypic data. The API empowers users to programmatically access data across multiple missions, experiments and datasets, facilitating meta-analysis and easing access to download large data files. As part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Open-Source Science Initiative, AWS and NASA have established a Space Act Agreement to explore optimal practices for discovering, accessing and utilizing high-value NASA science datasets. All public data in OSDR are now available on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (https://registry.opendata.aws/nasa-osdr/), enabling users to directly query and execute scripts across extensive datasets using AWS S3 command-line tools. The scientific community gains significantly from this initiative, which removes the time required to download large datasets and allows for analysis using AWS’s computational resources directly.Increasing engagement Analysis working groups As space-related biological, biomedical, and other life science data/metadata are precious national and global resources, OSDR serves not just as a data repository, but as a central community hub for global space life sciences/biomedical data, with scientific results helping enable life to thrive in space. Beyond making space biology and space health data FAIR and maximally open, OSDR (and its precursor GeneLab) was designed to maximally engage scientific community members to ensure OSDR is in line and up to date with scientific best practices, enable networking within and beyond the space biology community, and to build trust with users. This was accomplished by the development and expansion of the OSDR AWGs, which have grown into an enormous community around OSDR (https://awg.osdr.space/). There are ∼800 volunteer OSDR AWG members, who provide feedback on scientific standards for reuse (subject and assay metadata; data processing pipelines; dataset formats and uniform structures for machine-readability) and collaborate to mine and reuse OSDR data to conduct scientific analyses. OSDR has enabled 92 publications as of October 2024, many directly from AWG collaborations and most notably in ‘The Biology of Spaceflight’ Cell Press package in 2020 (https://www.cell.com/c/the-biology-of-spaceflight) and the ‘Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) across orbits’ Nature Portfolio package in 2024 (https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00009-8/index.html). The OSDR AWGs are open to anyone in the world to join and currently consist of members from ∼40 different countries. Participants range in career level from high school students to undergraduate and graduate students to postdocs to PIs and established scientists in a variety of different sectors including citizen scientists, academia, government, non-profits, NGOs and commercial industry.Greater access, inclusion and quality with standardized data processing ‘Omics data in their raw form are largely inaccessible to non-bioinformaticians; therefore, GeneLab collaborates with the scientific community via the AWG to develop standard processing pipelines to generate and publish processed data on OSDR. Unlike raw data, processed data have greater immediate value to diverse users with varying technical backgrounds and computational capabilities. Furthermore, standardizing processing workflows is essential to match the pace of raw data generation, ensure reproducibility and enable standardized processed data for comparison across datasets. At the second AWG annual workshop in 2019, GeneLab and the AWGs achieved a milestone by establishing and publishing the first RNAseq consensus pipeline (78). Building on this achievement, GeneLab has since developed standard processing pipelines for a variety of ‘omics assays across different genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic technologies. All these pipelines undergo a rigorous review process by the AWGs, incorporating feedback before their publication and implementation. These pipelines are publicly available on GitHub for broader access and use by the scientific community (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). GeneLab pipelines are wrapped into Nextflow workflows (79) to automate and accelerate processing of these ‘omics data types. In addition to core data processing, workflows also include raw data staging and a robust verification and validation program to identify errors in real-time, halt additional downstream computation and preserve computational resources. To enhance reproducibility of GeneLab-generated data and expand access to GeneLab workflows for users without sufficient computing resources or the knowledge to install and run software, GeneLab partnered with the Department of Energy through a memorandum of understanding to create the NASA EDGE Bioinformatics platform (https://nasa.edgebioinformatics.org/home). NASA EDGE (Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise; [(80)]) Bioinformatics is an open-access web-based platform that utilizes shared compute resources to run the GeneLab standardized bioinformatics workflows, which eliminates the need for researchers to have their own high-performance computing cluster. The web-based platform makes complicated biological analyses incredibly easy to perform, thus expanding the reach of these analyses to bioinformatics novices, students and even citizen scientists enabling them to contribute to scientific discoveries and progress.Visualization tools enable knowledge discovery Standardized processing pipelines in OSDR convert large volumes of raw data into tabular data that are easily interpretable, even for those without bioinformatics expertise, assuming the availability of suitable tools for data visualization. GeneLab recognized this need years ago by initiating the Visualization Platform, enabling users to delve into individual transcriptomic datasets. Building on this foundation, OSDR has introduced the Multi-Study Visualization Platform, enhancing functionality by allowing users to simultaneously compare data across multiple studies (https://visualization.genelab.nasa.gov/data/). Today, OSDR offers a comprehensive suite of visualization tools tailored for diverse research needs and designed to help users understand how environmental factors may affect OSDR biological data (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab OSDR Visualization Tools. Top left: Multi-study data visualization dashboard showing interactive processed transcriptomic data search filters, principal component analysis plot, differential gene expression table and normalized enrichment score plot. Top right: RadLab dashboard showing interactive radiation detection instrument selection, time-series plots and detector comparison plots. Bottom: EDA dashboard showing interactive temperature, humidity and CO2 plots, mission milestones and multiple mission comparison plots.The Multi-Study Visualization Platform enables the visualization of multiple RNA sequencing datasets simultaneously. Users can navigate through OSDR’s comprehensive dataset repository, applying filters such as experimental factors, assay technology types, organisms and tissue types to pinpoint specific studies. Once users select samples from one or more RNA sequencing datasets to combine, they have the flexibility to normalize the combined data using the DESeq2 Median of Ratios method, followed by performing differential expression analysis. Additional selections can be made after examining both normalized and unnormalized PCA plots. The visualization interface includes interactive tools like pair plots, volcano plots, ideograms, gene set enrichment analysis and differential gene expression charts, all designed to enhance the user's ability to explore and analyze the data effectively. Accessing environmental telemetry data of spacecraft relevant to the biological payloads available in OSDR has always been challenging due to data fragmentation and unclear data governance across space agencies and databases. To address this issue, OSDR introduced the Environmental Data Application (EDA; https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/eda), which transforms data streams from spacecraft into a time series format and reduces confounding factors among independent variables. As of October 2024, EDA focuses on telemetry and radiation data from Rodent Research missions aboard the ISS, encompassing temperature, relative humidity, CO2 levels and radiation dose. The application enables users to analyze data from individual missions, compare two missions and download both summary and detailed data tables. Plans to expand EDA’s capabilities to include additional biological payloads (human, plant, etc.) are contingent on receiving detailed data streams of information from the specific hardware and payloads involved. In response to difficulties in accessing radiation data, OSDR supported the creation of RadLab, a database integrating radiation dosimetry from multiple space agencies including NASA, ESA, the German and Italian Space Agencies and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. RadLab features a visualization portal (https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/radlab) and an API (https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/radlab/api) that facilitates data queries by craft, sensor type, time range and radiation type (e.g. galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, the contribution of the South Atlantic Anomaly), enhancing the accessibility and usability of these data. The API provides programmatic access for use in computational pipelines and GUIs for data visualization and exploration, making these data FAIR. OSDR is actively enhancing its integration with RadLab to provide average absorbed radiation doses for any payload, by incorporating these metadata directly into the repository. Additionally, radiation dose time series data are being directly fed into EDA to streamline access and analysis.Training the next generation of space biologists and bioinformaticians To sensitize the scientific community to space biology and increase the number of scientists who understand and utilize OSDR data and resources in 2021, OSDR introduced the GL4U training program (GeneLab for Colleges and Universities). GL4U leverages the consensus ‘omics processing pipelines, developed by GeneLab and the AWGs, to teach students about space biology and bioinformatics via a series of lectures and hands-on training through Jupyter notebooks. The program offers annual 1–2-week long bootcamps for both students and educators (https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-educator-resources/). During the bootcamps, participants complete the GL4U Introduction module set, which includes an introduction to NASA SMD, the NASA Space Biology program, OSDR and GeneLab, and hands-on training in basic coding in Unix and R. Participants then complete a GL4U ‘omics-specific module set, which includes lectures and hands-on training in experimental design and data processing using the GeneLab standard pipeline. As of October, 2024, GL4U ‘omics-specific module sets have been developed for RNA Sequencing and Amplicon Sequencing. To date, 14 educators and 76 students from 7 minority serving institutions have successfully completed a GL4U bootcamp. Pre- versus post-bootcamp surveys revealed a 115% increase, on average, in both participant understanding of ‘omics data processing and in familiarity with NASA Space Biology resources, showing the overwhelming success of these bootcamps. GeneLab is expanding GL4U into a series of open-access on-demand training modules. NASA’s SMD initiated the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) program in response to the 2022 White House mandate for open science for federal research, launching its operations in 2023, the Year of Open Science (18). The goal of TOPS is to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science in part by providing open-source training centered around open science. As part of this initiative, scientists from OSDR and the AWG were awarded a TOPS-T ScienceCore grant to create a training course titled: ‘Training in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Space Biological Sciences Using NASA Cloud-Based Data’. This course, available on the Canvas platform (enroll here: https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/8JYKD7), offers artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) training that uses space biology/health data, including OSDR datasets, to teach participants about space biology, model building, data handling and advanced modeling techniques. Students are shown how to interpret results through hands-on practice with real-world use cases from OSDR, using two large AI benchmark datasets released by OSDR for BPS on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (i.e. https://registry.opendata.aws/bps_microscopy/ and https://registry.opendata.aws/bps_rnaseq/). Originally offered synchronously through a live virtual course, the training is now also available asynchronously, allowing participants to engage with a rich array of data types such as phenotypic-physiological, biomedical, imaging and ‘omics data, all hosted on OSDR with extensive, standardized metadata and processed data files. This curriculum paves the way for new scientific discoveries by leveraging AI/ML to mine the comprehensive data resources available through OSDR.User roadmap for open science involvement All data, metadata, resources and trainings available in the OSDR ecosystem are designed to help lower the bar for entry for users worldwide to engage and contribute scientifically to space exploration. Here, we outline three potential journeys of users to leverage different aspects of the OSDR ecosystem (Figure 8). Figure 8. Open in a new tab User roadmap. Part 1: Student journey through OSDR training resources and visualization platforms. Part 2: PI journey through NBISC tissue request. Part 3: Student journey through TOPS-T AI/ML training resources and AWG collaboration.In the first journey, a student may leverage the training and visualization aspects of the OSDR ecosystem by completing GL4U RNAseq bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience in space biology 'omics data and bioinformatics. Equipped with this knowledge, the student now has the tools to download and analyze data from OSDR and identifies OSD-104 and OSD-105 as studies with muscle multi-omics data from Rodent Research-1 (RR-1). The student uses the Multi-Study Data Visualization portal to combine both datasets, generating a PCA plot and a volcano plot from the RNAseq data and examining the differentially expressed genes between flight and ground control samples. The student notes that the PCA plot shows a strong bias toward tissue difference dominating the impact of spaceflight versus ground control. The student uses the EDA to visualize environmental variables during the RR-1 mission to investigate whether there are any environmental impacts contributing to the 'omics signals. To expand on this analysis, the student joins an AWG and collaborates with other researchers to explore the epigenomics and proteomics data available in these studies. This collaboration leads to the generation of new data that culminates in a scientific publication. In the second journey, a PI with an established lab requests RR-1 and RR-9 muscle tissues from NBISC and performs functional analysis in the lab. While publishing the findings, the PI submits data to OSDR using the data submission tutorial (https://osdr-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and submits the data into OSDR. One of the functional data types does not yet have an assay metadata configuration nor data format standard in OSDR, so the PI joins the AWG and helps create a new assay standard as part of a consensus with other AWG SME members with expertise on that assay. An example of such a workflow is Braun et al., 2021 (81), who requested NBISC samples, then analyzed muscle calcium uptake, helped create the OSDR assay configuration for such measurement and submitted the data to OSDR (OSD-488). Finally, in the third journey, a student interested in using AI/ML approaches for space biology research enrolls in the asynchronous TOPS-T AI/ML for space biology training course. Enriched with new skills, the student proposes a project to the AWG to develop a predictive model using both RR-1 and RR-9 omics and functional data available on OSDR, leveraging the power of AI/ML for heterogeneous data types. The team re-analyzes the OSDR datasets and publishes their updated results, contributing valuable insights to the field. An example of a similar study is Li et al., 2023 (28), who analyzed 'omics and functional-physiological muscle data from OSDR using a ML workflow.

NPJ Microgravity, 2023, licensed under CC BY 4.0.Discussion and future directions The successful expansion of human life into deep space hinges on profound advancements in our understanding of space biology and the critical biomedical responses and health systems developed for long-duration and long-distance spaceflight missions. Centralizing and standardizing data, alongside the strategic reuse of tissues, are pivotal for maximizing the value extracted from every piece of available data and tissue. However, a meta-analysis of the field of space medicine and space life sciences by Bellomo et al. reviewed 1215 open-access articles and found that only a third shared their data. Analysis code was almost never shared, and practically no researchers used registered assay methodology standards (82). Especially as humanity nears returning to the Moon, this finding underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift towards open science in space biology and aerospace medicine, an essential shift required to develop health countermeasures and conduct space biological research. Responding to this need and leveraging the pioneering work of GeneLab (8), OSDR has rapidly expanded as a public resource to foster extensive engagement in spaceflight science, discovery, research, and development. This expansion has attracted tens of thousands of participants globally, especially via the AWG, and makes all relevant life sciences data from space experiments maximally open access and of high quality. Furthermore, ESA has recently adopted OSDR as its default portal for all life sciences ‘omics data, marking a significant international endorsement of OSDR standards. This collaboration is poised to augment OSDR with hundreds of terabytes of ‘omics data soon, enhancing the repository's utility and scope. Commercial astronauts are also actively participating in the space biology ecosystem by securely sharing their sensitive data through the OSDR DAR portal (10,18). Such practices not only show a shared commitment to centralizing valuable datasets between the scientific community and commercial space sectors but also enhance our ability to compare human, animal, microbial, plant and other data to deepen our understanding of space biology. Acknowledging the limitations of traditional statistical methods (83), OSDR is also broadening its analytical range to include AI/ML technologies (4,84). In partnership with researchers from UC San Francisco, OSDR is integrating a knowledge graph analysis tool known as 'SPOKE' (Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine) into its visualization-analysis portal. This integration aims to enable users to identify symptoms, diseases, and potential therapeutic targets by mining and comparing datasets, enhancing the utility of OSDR for advanced data-driven discoveries (85–87). OSDR is continuously refining its systems to provide better access and improved tools. The OSDR API will continue evolving to better serve users, with plans to develop more visualization tools for data analytics, including single-cell sequencing, metagenomics and physio-phenotypic-bioimaging data. AI/ML enhancements will streamline data submission, and an OSDR chatbot is being developed to help users discover and interpret datasets more easily. To conclude, as humanity has entered the ‘Second Space Age’ (88), a central goal for the future of OSDR has evolved from FAIR data and metadata to the FAIREST principles, standing for more Engagement, more Social connections, and more Trust in its quality and stewardship (89). As the commercial spaceflight industry expands, OSDR is poised to facilitate broader public access to life science and biomedical data. As a leading force in open science, OSDR empowers the global community to actively engage in space exploration and discovery, aligning directly with NASA’s ambitious goals for the ‘Moon to Mars’ (90) and Artemis campaigns.Acknowledgements We wish to thank the scientific community including data submitters, users and advisors for their longstanding support of OSDR.

    "title": "Artificial gravity attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11593819/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Keywords: spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), optic nerve, retina, RNA-seq, artificial gravity",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Physiological and pathological neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been observed in astronauts that have undergone prolonged spaceflight, a phenomenon known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1,2,3]. Our previous rodent flight studies have shown that spaceflight induces adverse effects on retinal structure, blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and retinal function [4,5]. More recent research also reports optic nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optic nerve disc [6]. These findings warrant research on the role of spaceflight conditions, including microgravity (MG), on the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN) in the development of SANS [7]. To date, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of SANS. Changes in gravity are critical aspects of spaceflight which may contribute to adverse responses. Artificial gravity (AG) by centrifugal force is a potential countermeasure to mitigate the effects of MG on board the International Space Station (ISS) [8]. Rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS provide opportunities to assess the effectiveness of AG in space. Prior work from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mouse habitat unit-1 (MHU-1) showed that exposure to 1 G of AG effectively reduced endothelial cell damage and increased cellular organization and function in the RTN compared to the MG group without centrifugation [9]. Results from the same flight study also showed that mice exposed to artificial 1 G had reduced musculoskeletal deterioration associated with spaceflight [10]. These studies provide evidence that AG may protect against or mitigate the effects of MG. However, it is currently not known what gravity level and duration of gravitational force must be maintained to prevent or reduce retinal damage. For the current study, AG was generated by onboard short-radius centrifuges installed in the Centrifuge-Equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS, created by JAXA [10]. Mice were exposed to either MG alone (0 G), or to 0.33 G, 0.67 G, or 1 G by centrifugation for the duration of a 30-day flight mission. Our in-depth transcriptomic analysis allowed us to robustly characterize and compare molecular responses in the ON and RTN. This study aims to evaluate whether AG could mitigate the deleterious effects of MG on the RTN and ON during spaceflight. Our study also aims to compare the effectiveness of different AG levels and define the relationship between gravitational dose and cellular response by assessing an oxidative stress biomarker and transcriptomic endpoints. This information is expected to provide valuable knowledge of the mechanisms that contribute to ON/RTN dysfunction and facilitate the development of an optimal AG protocol for eye protection during spaceflight.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Mouse Habitat Unit-8 and Mouse Groups A total of 24 male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed on Earth during a four-week period of acclimation to housing, food, and water conditions. The mice were then transferred to the Transportation Cage Unit (TCU) and launched at ~12 weeks of age from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-27 (Dragon) on 15 March 2023 (GMT) for a 30-day MHU-8 mission. Within 24 h after arriving at the ISS, the animals were individually housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) located in the Kibo centrifuge hardware Cell Biology Experimental Facility on the ISS. The 24 flight mice were subdivided into four groups. The first group of flight mice were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (0 G group), the second and third groups of flight mice were exposed to continuous AG of 0.33 G and 0.67 G, respectively, and the fourth group was exposed to continuous AG of 1 G. AG was achieved through the use of short-arm centrifuges for the duration of the MHU-8 mission, with only brief stoppages for husbandry and experimental procedures several times throughout the mission. The AG mice were subjected to AG immediately after being transferred to their HCUs. The rotation rates for generating 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G were 44 rpm, 63 rpm, and 77 rpm, respectively. The flight mice then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 2023, and returned to Earth alive. A total of 12 male C57BL/6J HGC mice from the same cohort as the FLT mice were also housed individually during a four-week period of acclimation and were then maintained in similar habitat conditions as the FLT mice, inside the ISSES Chambers, with operations conducted with a 3-day delay relative to the FLT mice. All FLT and HGC mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. Within 6 h of landing, all FLT mice were euthanized by inhalation of 3% isoflurane and then maintained at 1.5–2% for blood collection following euthanasia, and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. HGC mice were euthanized 3 days later by the same method. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of JAXA and NASA. No protocol was required from the Loma Linda University (LLU) IACUC, since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. The research with vertebrate animals was conducted in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America. 4.2. Mouse Eye Tissue Harvest and Preservation After necropsy, mouse eyes were harvested. The left eyes from each experimental group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The retina and optic nerve of the right eyes were dissected out from the eye globe [35] and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction and RNA-seq. 4.3. Retina RNA Extraction RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). A homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 retina tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and 900 μL of cold homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at a speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the Qubit RNA BR kit following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.4. Optic Nerve RNA Extraction RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. QIAzol was used as a homogenization buffer and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 optic nerve tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and cold QIAzol homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Qubit RNA BR or HS kits following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.5. Sequencing Library Construction ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Spike-in data were used for sample quality control. RNA ribo depletion and library preparation were conducted with Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Input RNA was approximately 100 ng with RIN > 4. For RTN samples FLT17 and FLT02, and ON samples FLT11, FLT21, FLT04, FLT23, FLT12, FLT02, and HGC05, RNA input was below 30 ng, and ERCC spike-in and quality control could not be performed for these samples. Unique dual index adapters (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used, and 12 cycles of PCR were performed using the BioRad C1000 Touch (BIO RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Pooled library concentration was measured by the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). 4.6. Sequencing RNA sequencing was performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp; Index1: 17 bp; Index2: 8 bp; Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX Sequencing Control V3 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was included as a control and to increase library diversity. The protocol followed is the SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). 4.7. RNA-Seq Data Analysis Raw fastq files were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) [36], and adaptors and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) [37] powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7) [38]. Trimmed fastq file quality was then evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) [39], and MultiQC (version 1.1.9) [11] was used to generate MultiQC reports. Trimmed fastq files were then mapped with STAR (version 2.7.10a) [40]. We used the Ensembl [41] release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) as a reference genome. The following gtf annotation file was used: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) [42,43]; then, aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1) [44], with strandedness set to reverse. Quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) [45] and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) [46]; all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4) [47,48,49], PANTHER.db (v1.0.11) [50,51,52], and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.15.0). Genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjusted p < 0.05 were selected as significant DEGs. PCA plots for the ON and RTN were made separately using the normalized gene expression data obtained from DESeq2. The analysis was done in R (version 4.0.3). The R function aov() [53] was used to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on each gene using each treatment as a factor, and genes with p < 0.05 were selected for input into the PCA. PCAs were performed using the R function PCA() [54,55,56]. Pathway analysis and plotting were performed separately on the ON and RTN DEGs (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) using R (version 4.0.3) with the enrichR package (version 3.2) [57,58]. setEnrichrSite(“Enrichr”) was used for performing general enrichment analysis. Only the KEGG_2019_Mouse [59] library was used for analysis. 4.8. Comparison of DEGs Overlapping Between Spaceflight, Glaucoma, and Optic Nerve Crush Models Published glaucoma and optic nerve crush DEG tables (both relative to healthy controls) were obtained [12], and genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjusted p < 0.05 were taken to be significant. Separate lists were obtained for the ON and RTN, which contained DEGs at all time points observed in the study for both optic nerve crush and glaucoma models. Optic nerve crush and glaucoma DEGs in unmyelinated optic nerve (UON) and myelinated optic nerve (MON) were combined into a single list for the ON. We then determined the overlaps between spaceflight (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) DEGs in the ON and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in the ON, and similarly determined the overlaps between spaceflight DEGs in the RTN and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in RTN. 4.9. Statistical Comparison of FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEG Overlaps For the ON and RTN separately, we counted the number of significant DEGs that changed in the same direction in the two comparisons (FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G) according to the log2 FC, and we similarly counted the number of DEGs that changed in the opposite direction. Let S = the number of DEGs changing in the same direction, O = the number of DEGs changing in the opposite direction, and n = S + O. We thus performed a binomial test using the function “binom.test” in R version 4.0.3, with x = S, n = N, and p = 0.5. 4.10. Immunostaining for Oxidative Stress Biomarker Evaluation Paraffin-embedded sections (six µm) of the left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n = 5–6/group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using the 4-HNE antibody specific to lipid peroxidation (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA). Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. Six to ten field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, USA) at 20× magnification spanning the entire retina sections. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity (red channel for 4-HNE) was measured in these captured images of each section and calculated using ImageJ software (V1.53) [60]. The data were then extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group.",

RNA-Seq of the Mouse RTN and ON During Spaceflight with Progressive AG We performed RNA-seq of the ON and RTN of MHU-8 mice under MG, as well as under 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G of AG, during spaceflight for the flight groups (FLT) as well as for habitat ground control (HGC) mice, which were maintained in housing conditions that were identical to those of the FLT groups. For each FLT group, 5–6 biological replicates were used, and 12 biological replicates were used for the HGC group. MultiQC reports [11] showed that all samples had uniformly high sequencing quality across both read pairs (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1a,b). Normalized gene expression was strongly correlated between replicates of the same experimental group (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1c,d). To verify cell-type-specific enrichment within our samples, we looked at the gene expression of specific marker genes known to be enriched in either the ON or RTN relative to the other. Ptx3 and Mbp showed high RNA-seq expression in all ON treatment groups and low expression in all RTN treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1e,f), consistent with the enrichment of these genes observed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (Ptx3) and RNA-seq (Ptx3 and Mbp) in the ON relative to the RTN [12]. Similarly, Rho and Pou4f1 showed high RNA-seq expression in all RTN treatment groups and low expression in all ON treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1g,h); Rho was previously shown by RNA-seq to be enriched in the RTN and depleted in the ON [12]/while Pou4f1 (Brn3a) is a gold-standard retinal ganglion cell marker in mice [13]. 2.2. Spaceflight Induces Robust Transcriptomic Responses in the Mouse ON and RTN We first compared FLT 0 G vs. HGC RNA-seq in order to determine the effects of spaceflight on transcription in the ON and RTN. We identified a total of 206 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the ON (Figure 1a), and 285 DEGs in the RTN (Figure 1b). Scgb2b12, Bpifb9b, Bpifb9a, Pnmt, and Gm10408 were the top five DEGs by magnitude in the ON (Figure 1c), while Muc5b, Klf17, Gm9139, Scgb1c1, and Serpinb6d were the top five in the RTN (Figure 1d). The majority of DEGs in the ON were distinct from those in the RTN, with only 28 DEGs being common to both the ON and RTN (Figure 1e). These findings demonstrate substantial transcriptional changes in response to spaceflight conditions in both the ON and RTN and warrant further investigation into their functional roles in MG adaptation and the development of SANS. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to spaceflight in the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN).

(e) Venn diagram showing the number of spaceflight DEGs distinct and overlapping between ON and RTN. DEGs that are upregulated and downregulated at 0 G relative to the HGC group are indicated.Next, we conducted a pathway analysis of the significant FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs. Forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling, PI3k-Akt signaling, and p53 signaling were among the top pathways by significance in the ON (Figure 2a), whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and p53 signaling were among the top pathways in the RTN (Figure 2b). Interestingly, p53 signaling was significantly enriched in the ON both after optic nerve crush and in a model of glaucoma [12], suggesting some overlap in the transcriptomic responses to spaceflight, optic nerve crush, and glaucoma. Indeed, we identified a subset of FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs that are also differentially expressed in published optic nerve crush and/or glaucoma models [12] in each of the ON and RTN (Supplementary File S2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Pathway analysis of spaceflight (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) DEGs. (a,b) Top 20 most significant pathways enriched among spaceflight DEGs, ordered by significance. The number of spaceflight DEGs within each pathway is shown on the x-axis. 2.3. AG Attenuates the Transcriptomic Response to Spaceflight in the ON and RTN Next, we compared spaceflight gene expression under progressive amounts of AG and found that the numbers of DEGs relative to the HGC group trended downward when going from 0 G to 1 G of AG in both the ON and RTN (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a,b). A major exception to this trend was in the ON at 0.33 G, which had a larger number of DEGs than all other treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a). We also looked specifically at the effect of AG on the normalized expression of the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs, as well as global gene expression patterns. In both cases, as AG progressed toward 1 G, gene expression tended to revert to the pattern of the HGC group (Figure 3a–f and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2c,d). The ON at 0.33 G was again an outlier of this pattern. However, in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot of individual replicates, it can be seen that three replicates of the ON at 0.33 G were extreme outliers that did not cluster with each other or with the other three 0.33 G replicates, whereas the other three replicates clustered together and followed the trend of progressively reverting to the gene expression pattern of the HGC group when moving from 0 G to 1 G of AG (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2c). It is therefore likely that the anomalous behavior of the ON at 0.33 G is due to some unidentified technical or experimental artifacts in three of the replicates, and not reflective of an actual biological response. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AG attenuates gene expression changes induced by spaceflight in both the ON and RTN in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest attenuation occurring at 1 G. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene expression during spaceflight under artificial gravity (AG). (a,b) Heatmaps of the average expression of significant DEGs (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) in the indicated treatment group. Genes are sorted by hierarchical clustering. (c,d) Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of normalized gene expression data averaged over replicates of each treatment group indicated. (e,f) Reads per million (RPM)-normalized gene expression of example genes, with replicates of each treatment group pooled.We then looked at the effect of AG on genes within select pathways among those most significantly altered by spaceflight (Figure 2a,b). The expression of a subset of genes within the FoxO signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway in the ON, and the PPAR signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway in the RTN, showed a trend of progressive attenuation as AG was increased from 0 G to 1 G (Figure 4a–d). This is also true of the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway in the ON (Supplementary File S1: Figure S3). Our results therefore suggest that not only are these pathways potentially important in the transcriptomic response to spaceflight within the ON/RTN, but that AG might also attenuate the alteration of these pathways during spaceflight. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of AG on gene expression in select pathways. (a–d) Heatmaps of the normalized gene expression, averaged over replicates of the indicated samples and treatment groups, of the genes with the top ten magnitudes of log2 FC in FLT 0 G vs. HGC from the indicated pathways. Gene symbols are shown to the right of each heatmap. Genes are sorted by hierarchical clustering.To obtain further evidence of AG-attenuated transcriptional responses during spaceflight, we compared the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs to the FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEGs. If robust attenuation of the spaceflight response occurs at 1 G, then the transcriptome at 1 G should be similar to that of the HGC group, and so the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs should tend to change in the same direction as the FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEGs. Indeed, significantly more DEGs changed in the same direction than in the opposite direction in both the ON and RTN (Figure 5a,b), and, in fact, no genes changed in the opposite direction in either the ON or RTN. This supports the idea that adding 1 G of AG on the ISS attenuates the effects of MG. Mice at 1 G of AG maintained similar levels of transcriptome expression to HGC mice, as exemplified by Pdk4 in the ON (Figure 5c) and Cdkn1a in the RTN (Figure 5d). Figure 5.

AG Attenuates a Spaceflight-Induced Increase in the Oxidative Stress Biomarker 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the RTN Given the prevalence of oxidative stress-related pathways in our spaceflight data, we measured the effects of spaceflight and AG on the expression of 4-HNE in the RTN by immunofluorescence. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation and plays an important role in oxidative stress-mediated responses [14,15]. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the 0 G and 0.33 G groups compared to all other groups (Figure 6a). Spaceflight significantly increased the immunoreactivity of 4-HNE relative to that observed in HGC animals (p < 0.05), while 0.67 G and 1 G of AG rendered 4-HNE immunoreactivity indistinguishable from that observed in HGC animals (Figure 6b). These results demonstrate a spaceflight-induced increase in oxidative stress in the RTN, which can be attenuated by at least 0.67 G of AG. Figure 6.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion The current study demonstrates that spaceflight induces transcriptomic changes in optic nerve and retinal tissue. Our pathway analysis suggests that these changes may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Such pathway changes could lead to ocular injury and degeneration. Our study is the first to assess the role of different doses of AG for the duration of spaceflight on the ISS as a countermeasure to protect and mitigate the effects of MG on the eye. In addition, our study is the first to observe spaceflight-induced transcriptomic responses specifically within the ON and RTN. The majority of our data documented that continuous AG on the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in a dose-dependent manner, with 1 G providing the strongest attenuation. These results suggest that added AG can be implemented to prevent or reduce the ocular physiological and cellular damage induced by spaceflight stressors. As a potential preventive approach, optimal centrifugation prescriptions may modulate the normal tissue response to spaceflight conditions or increase the tolerance of the retina and optic nerves to injuries. In this study, the p53 signaling pathway is among the top pathways enriched by pathway analysis in the ON and RTN. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors, including p53 [16]. Dysregulation of p53 pathways then leads to impaired DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis [17]. Recent research has also shown that p53 plays an important role in the progression of retinal degenerative disorders including age-related macular degeneration [18]. Our results reveal that the alteration of genes within the p53 signaling pathway was progressively attenuated by AG from 0.33 G to 1 G. Oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in spaceflight and in space radiation-induced ocular damage [19,20]. The measurement of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-hydroxynonenal in the RTN in this study confirms both spaceflight-induced oxidative stress within the RTN, as well as attenuation of oxidative stress within the RTN at 0.67 G and 1 G of AG compared to 0 G. By modulating the level of oxidative stress with added AG, it may be possible to mitigate the damaging effects of MG on ocular tissue. The FoxO signaling pathway is significantly enriched by pathway analysis in the ON due to spaceflight. Furthermore, the expression of genes within this pathway shows a pattern of progressive attenuation in moving from 0 G to 1 G of AG. FoxO proteins act as key regulators in a wide range of crucial cellular processes involving stress, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis [21]. FoxO signaling dysregulation due to spaceflight conditions may lead to a negative impact on ON health. Similarly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is significantly enriched by spaceflight in the ON, and patterns of gene expression within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increasing AG. The PI3k-Akt signaling pathway plays a key regulatory role in cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, cell cycle progression, and metabolism [22]. Its influence in mediating neurological effects has been documented [23]. There is a strong link between activation of the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway and oxidative stress/inflammation [24,25]. Studies have shown that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [26]. Interestingly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is documented to be the most important pathway interacting with FoxO in regulating different physiological processes and pathological events or diseases [27]. In the RTN, the PPAR signaling pathway is significantly enriched due to spaceflight by pathway analysis, and genes within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increased AG doses. Genes within the PPAR signaling pathway play crucial roles in glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation [28]. A simulated MG study by hindlimb suspension revealed the differential expression of a number of transcripts, including the PPARs that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in the muscle [29]. Our data from this study indicate that adding AG for the duration of spaceflight on the ISS, especially higher doses of 0.67 G and 1 G, can bring gene expression patterns closer to those of the grounded control group. This study provides evidence that in-flight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceflight. In this study, we found that the ON and RTN exhibited mostly distinct transcriptomic responses. The cellular components and structure of the ON and RTN are notably different in terms of cell types, astrocytic features, vascular density, and metabolic activity, as well as permeability and blood barrier properties [12]. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ON head lack blood–brain barrier (BBB) characteristic proteins, while the RTN has BBB biomarkers [30]. More recently, a study found that notable changes in the expression of several biomarkers related to the blood barrier in the ON head following space radiation exposure differ from those of the RTN [20]. The largely unique gene expression profiles observed in this study in the ON and RTN point to a complex response to space-specific environmental insults. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking the observed transcriptomic changes to the development of pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities. Spaceflight stressors besides MG, including cosmic radiation, magnetic changes, hypergravity during transport, and other space-specific environmental influences, might all have effects on ocular health [31]. This study did not explicitly control for additional potential stressors, including hypergravity, cosmic radiation, and magnetic changes, in the HGC mice. Although MG and cosmic radiation are considered the primary sources of harmful effects during spaceflight [31], secondary sources such as hypergravity may have made minor contributions to the observed transcriptomic changes during spaceflight. Further, during a short, 30-day mission, the mice are only expected to be exposed to relatively low doses of cosmic radiation. However, there is evidence that MG and cosmic radiation may act synergistically [31]. The fact that there are relatively few DEGs and low 4-HNE staining at 0.67–1 G (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a,b and Figure 6b, respectively) may therefore suggest either that spaceflight stressors other than MG did not have a major effect at all in this study, or that they did have a substantial effect synergistically with MG that was attenuated under substantial AG. Stressors like cosmic radiation are likely to be more substantial during spaceflight of a longer duration. It is possible that continuous AG above 0.67 G may help protect against the effects of MG and other spaceflight stressors during longer missions on the ISS, though this is speculative. It will be important in future studies to expose mice to a longer duration of spaceflight on the ISS to determine the effectiveness of AG in attenuating the effects of spaceflight stressors. In order for the collected data from the current study to be comparable to the data from past MHU missions [9,32,33], only male mice were used in this study. However, we recognize the importance of studying both sexes for space research to understand how sex and gender differences impact long-term health in astronauts. It will be important in future research to incorporate both male and female mice to better understand their differences in response to space-specific environmental stressors. In the present study, we observed increased 4-HNE activity in the retinal GCL of the FLT 0 G and 0.33 G groups. The exact cell types of the positive staining need to be further characterized by double staining with specific biomarkers. However, the morphology of these 4-HNE signals resembles Müller cell endfeet. Müller cells are glial cells in the retina that provide metabolic and homeostatic support to neurons and photoreceptors. Increased activation and hypertrophy of Müller cells occurs in a process called gliosis in response to retinal damage or stress [32,33]. The effect of retinal gliosis on neurodegeneration has been reported [34]. Reduced 4-HNE staining on Müller cells by higher doses of AG may indicate protective effects against the impact of MG on the retina by mechanisms of attenuating oxidative stress and altering Müller glial activation and gliosis processes.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions We conclude that adding artificial gravity by centrifugation on board the ISS, especially near 1 G, can significantly reduce transcriptomic alteration induced by spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Clearly, more research on the ocular response to microgravity and its interaction with other spaceflight physiological stressors is warranted. Further investigation will also be needed to extend the observation time after the animals return alive from the centrifugation study on the ISS.",

Copyright notice ID: 11593819 PMID: 39596110 Abstract The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Keywords: spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), optic nerve, retina, RNA-seq, artificial gravity1. Introduction Physiological and pathological neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been observed in astronauts that have undergone prolonged spaceflight, a phenomenon known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1,2,3]. Our previous rodent flight studies have shown that spaceflight induces adverse effects on retinal structure, blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and retinal function [4,5]. More recent research also reports optic nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optic nerve disc [6]. These findings warrant research on the role of spaceflight conditions, including microgravity (MG), on the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN) in the development of SANS [7]. To date, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of SANS. Changes in gravity are critical aspects of spaceflight which may contribute to adverse responses. Artificial gravity (AG) by centrifugal force is a potential countermeasure to mitigate the effects of MG on board the International Space Station (ISS) [8]. Rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS provide opportunities to assess the effectiveness of AG in space. Prior work from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mouse habitat unit-1 (MHU-1) showed that exposure to 1 G of AG effectively reduced endothelial cell damage and increased cellular organization and function in the RTN compared to the MG group without centrifugation [9]. Results from the same flight study also showed that mice exposed to artificial 1 G had reduced musculoskeletal deterioration associated with spaceflight [10]. These studies provide evidence that AG may protect against or mitigate the effects of MG. However, it is currently not known what gravity level and duration of gravitational force must be maintained to prevent or reduce retinal damage. For the current study, AG was generated by onboard short-radius centrifuges installed in the Centrifuge-Equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS, created by JAXA [10]. Mice were exposed to either MG alone (0 G), or to 0.33 G, 0.67 G, or 1 G by centrifugation for the duration of a 30-day flight mission. Our in-depth transcriptomic analysis allowed us to robustly characterize and compare molecular responses in the ON and RTN. This study aims to evaluate whether AG could mitigate the deleterious effects of MG on the RTN and ON during spaceflight. Our study also aims to compare the effectiveness of different AG levels and define the relationship between gravitational dose and cellular response by assessing an oxidative stress biomarker and transcriptomic endpoints. This information is expected to provide valuable knowledge of the mechanisms that contribute to ON/RTN dysfunction and facilitate the development of an optimal AG protocol for eye protection during spaceflight.2. Results 2.1. RNA-Seq of the Mouse RTN and ON During Spaceflight with Progressive AG We performed RNA-seq of the ON and RTN of MHU-8 mice under MG, as well as under 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G of AG, during spaceflight for the flight groups (FLT) as well as for habitat ground control (HGC) mice, which were maintained in housing conditions that were identical to those of the FLT groups. For each FLT group, 5–6 biological replicates were used, and 12 biological replicates were used for the HGC group. MultiQC reports [11] showed that all samples had uniformly high sequencing quality across both read pairs (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1a,b). Normalized gene expression was strongly correlated between replicates of the same experimental group (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1c,d). To verify cell-type-specific enrichment within our samples, we looked at the gene expression of specific marker genes known to be enriched in either the ON or RTN relative to the other. Ptx3 and Mbp showed high RNA-seq expression in all ON treatment groups and low expression in all RTN treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1e,f), consistent with the enrichment of these genes observed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (Ptx3) and RNA-seq (Ptx3 and Mbp) in the ON relative to the RTN [12]. Similarly, Rho and Pou4f1 showed high RNA-seq expression in all RTN treatment groups and low expression in all ON treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S1g,h); Rho was previously shown by RNA-seq to be enriched in the RTN and depleted in the ON [12]/while Pou4f1 (Brn3a) is a gold-standard retinal ganglion cell marker in mice [13].2.2. Spaceflight Induces Robust Transcriptomic Responses in the Mouse ON and RTN We first compared FLT 0 G vs. HGC RNA-seq in order to determine the effects of spaceflight on transcription in the ON and RTN. We identified a total of 206 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the ON (Figure 1a), and 285 DEGs in the RTN (Figure 1b). Scgb2b12, Bpifb9b, Bpifb9a, Pnmt, and Gm10408 were the top five DEGs by magnitude in the ON (Figure 1c), while Muc5b, Klf17, Gm9139, Scgb1c1, and Serpinb6d were the top five in the RTN (Figure 1d). The majority of DEGs in the ON were distinct from those in the RTN, with only 28 DEGs being common to both the ON and RTN (Figure 1e). These findings demonstrate substantial transcriptional changes in response to spaceflight conditions in both the ON and RTN and warrant further investigation into their functional roles in MG adaptation and the development of SANS. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to spaceflight in the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN). (a,b) Heatmaps depicting the normalized expression and log2 Fold Change (FC) of the significant DEGs in the spaceflight group (FLT) under 0 G compared to habitat ground control (HGC) mice in the ON and RTN, as indicated. Genes are ordered by |log2 FC|. (c,d) Volcano plots of the comparison of FLT 0 G vs. HGC in the ON and RTN, as indicated. Significant DEGs are shown in red. For the top 5 DEGs by magnitude of log2 FC that have a unique gene symbol, the gene symbols are displayed. (e) Venn diagram showing the number of spaceflight DEGs distinct and overlapping between ON and RTN. DEGs that are upregulated and downregulated at 0 G relative to the HGC group are indicated.Next, we conducted a pathway analysis of the significant FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs. Forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling, PI3k-Akt signaling, and p53 signaling were among the top pathways by significance in the ON (Figure 2a), whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and p53 signaling were among the top pathways in the RTN (Figure 2b). Interestingly, p53 signaling was significantly enriched in the ON both after optic nerve crush and in a model of glaucoma [12], suggesting some overlap in the transcriptomic responses to spaceflight, optic nerve crush, and glaucoma. Indeed, we identified a subset of FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs that are also differentially expressed in published optic nerve crush and/or glaucoma models [12] in each of the ON and RTN (Supplementary File S2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Pathway analysis of spaceflight (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) DEGs. (a,b) Top 20 most significant pathways enriched among spaceflight DEGs, ordered by significance. The number of spaceflight DEGs within each pathway is shown on the x-axis.2.3. AG Attenuates the Transcriptomic Response to Spaceflight in the ON and RTN Next, we compared spaceflight gene expression under progressive amounts of AG and found that the numbers of DEGs relative to the HGC group trended downward when going from 0 G to 1 G of AG in both the ON and RTN (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a,b). A major exception to this trend was in the ON at 0.33 G, which had a larger number of DEGs than all other treatment groups (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a). We also looked specifically at the effect of AG on the normalized expression of the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs, as well as global gene expression patterns. In both cases, as AG progressed toward 1 G, gene expression tended to revert to the pattern of the HGC group (Figure 3a–f and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2c,d). The ON at 0.33 G was again an outlier of this pattern. However, in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot of individual replicates, it can be seen that three replicates of the ON at 0.33 G were extreme outliers that did not cluster with each other or with the other three 0.33 G replicates, whereas the other three replicates clustered together and followed the trend of progressively reverting to the gene expression pattern of the HGC group when moving from 0 G to 1 G of AG (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2c). It is therefore likely that the anomalous behavior of the ON at 0.33 G is due to some unidentified technical or experimental artifacts in three of the replicates, and not reflective of an actual biological response. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AG attenuates gene expression changes induced by spaceflight in both the ON and RTN in a dose-dependent manner, with the strongest attenuation occurring at 1 G. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene expression during spaceflight under artificial gravity (AG). (a,b) Heatmaps of the average expression of significant DEGs (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) in the indicated treatment group. Genes are sorted by hierarchical clustering. (c,d) Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of normalized gene expression data averaged over replicates of each treatment group indicated. (e,f) Reads per million (RPM)-normalized gene expression of example genes, with replicates of each treatment group pooled.We then looked at the effect of AG on genes within select pathways among those most significantly altered by spaceflight (Figure 2a,b). The expression of a subset of genes within the FoxO signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway in the ON, and the PPAR signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway in the RTN, showed a trend of progressive attenuation as AG was increased from 0 G to 1 G (Figure 4a–d). This is also true of the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway in the ON (Supplementary File S1: Figure S3). Our results therefore suggest that not only are these pathways potentially important in the transcriptomic response to spaceflight within the ON/RTN, but that AG might also attenuate the alteration of these pathways during spaceflight. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of AG on gene expression in select pathways. (a–d) Heatmaps of the normalized gene expression, averaged over replicates of the indicated samples and treatment groups, of the genes with the top ten magnitudes of log2 FC in FLT 0 G vs. HGC from the indicated pathways. Gene symbols are shown to the right of each heatmap. Genes are sorted by hierarchical clustering.To obtain further evidence of AG-attenuated transcriptional responses during spaceflight, we compared the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs to the FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEGs. If robust attenuation of the spaceflight response occurs at 1 G, then the transcriptome at 1 G should be similar to that of the HGC group, and so the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs should tend to change in the same direction as the FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEGs. Indeed, significantly more DEGs changed in the same direction than in the opposite direction in both the ON and RTN (Figure 5a,b), and, in fact, no genes changed in the opposite direction in either the ON or RTN. This supports the idea that adding 1 G of AG on the ISS attenuates the effects of MG. Mice at 1 G of AG maintained similar levels of transcriptome expression to HGC mice, as exemplified by Pdk4 in the ON (Figure 5c) and Cdkn1a in the RTN (Figure 5d). Figure 5. Open in a new tab 1 G of AG results in a transcriptome that is similar to that of the HGC group. (a,b) Barplots comparing the FLT 0 G vs. HGC DEGs to the FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEGs.

AG Attenuates a Spaceflight-Induced Increase in the Oxidative Stress Biomarker 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the RTN Given the prevalence of oxidative stress-related pathways in our spaceflight data, we measured the effects of spaceflight and AG on the expression of 4-HNE in the RTN by immunofluorescence. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation and plays an important role in oxidative stress-mediated responses [14,15]. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the 0 G and 0.33 G groups compared to all other groups (Figure 6a). Spaceflight significantly increased the immunoreactivity of 4-HNE relative to that observed in HGC animals (p < 0.05), while 0.67 G and 1 G of AG rendered 4-HNE immunoreactivity indistinguishable from that observed in HGC animals (Figure 6b). These results demonstrate a spaceflight-induced increase in oxidative stress in the RTN, which can be attenuated by at least 0.67 G of AG. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cellular oxidative damage in the male mouse retina under AG at 0 G, 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G. (a) Representative micrographs of ocular sections from the HGC or spaceflight mice groups for lipid peroxidation by immunostaining with anti-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) antibody are shown. 4-HNE-positive cells were identified with red fluorescence.

Discussion The current study demonstrates that spaceflight induces transcriptomic changes in optic nerve and retinal tissue. Our pathway analysis suggests that these changes may involve oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Such pathway changes could lead to ocular injury and degeneration. Our study is the first to assess the role of different doses of AG for the duration of spaceflight on the ISS as a countermeasure to protect and mitigate the effects of MG on the eye. In addition, our study is the first to observe spaceflight-induced transcriptomic responses specifically within the ON and RTN. The majority of our data documented that continuous AG on the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in a dose-dependent manner, with 1 G providing the strongest attenuation. These results suggest that added AG can be implemented to prevent or reduce the ocular physiological and cellular damage induced by spaceflight stressors. As a potential preventive approach, optimal centrifugation prescriptions may modulate the normal tissue response to spaceflight conditions or increase the tolerance of the retina and optic nerves to injuries. In this study, the p53 signaling pathway is among the top pathways enriched by pathway analysis in the ON and RTN. Oxidative stress can activate a variety of transcription factors, including p53 [16]. Dysregulation of p53 pathways then leads to impaired DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis [17]. Recent research has also shown that p53 plays an important role in the progression of retinal degenerative disorders including age-related macular degeneration [18]. Our results reveal that the alteration of genes within the p53 signaling pathway was progressively attenuated by AG from 0.33 G to 1 G. Oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in spaceflight and in space radiation-induced ocular damage [19,20]. The measurement of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-hydroxynonenal in the RTN in this study confirms both spaceflight-induced oxidative stress within the RTN, as well as attenuation of oxidative stress within the RTN at 0.67 G and 1 G of AG compared to 0 G. By modulating the level of oxidative stress with added AG, it may be possible to mitigate the damaging effects of MG on ocular tissue. The FoxO signaling pathway is significantly enriched by pathway analysis in the ON due to spaceflight. Furthermore, the expression of genes within this pathway shows a pattern of progressive attenuation in moving from 0 G to 1 G of AG. FoxO proteins act as key regulators in a wide range of crucial cellular processes involving stress, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis [21]. FoxO signaling dysregulation due to spaceflight conditions may lead to a negative impact on ON health. Similarly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is significantly enriched by spaceflight in the ON, and patterns of gene expression within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increasing AG. The PI3k-Akt signaling pathway plays a key regulatory role in cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, cell cycle progression, and metabolism [22]. Its influence in mediating neurological effects has been documented [23]. There is a strong link between activation of the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway and oxidative stress/inflammation [24,25]. Studies have shown that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [26]. Interestingly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is documented to be the most important pathway interacting with FoxO in regulating different physiological processes and pathological events or diseases [27]. In the RTN, the PPAR signaling pathway is significantly enriched due to spaceflight by pathway analysis, and genes within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increased AG doses. Genes within the PPAR signaling pathway play crucial roles in glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation [28]. A simulated MG study by hindlimb suspension revealed the differential expression of a number of transcripts, including the PPARs that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in the muscle [29]. Our data from this study indicate that adding AG for the duration of spaceflight on the ISS, especially higher doses of 0.67 G and 1 G, can bring gene expression patterns closer to those of the grounded control group. This study provides evidence that in-flight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceflight. In this study, we found that the ON and RTN exhibited mostly distinct transcriptomic responses. The cellular components and structure of the ON and RTN are notably different in terms of cell types, astrocytic features, vascular density, and metabolic activity, as well as permeability and blood barrier properties [12]. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ON head lack blood–brain barrier (BBB) characteristic proteins, while the RTN has BBB biomarkers [30]. More recently, a study found that notable changes in the expression of several biomarkers related to the blood barrier in the ON head following space radiation exposure differ from those of the RTN [20]. The largely unique gene expression profiles observed in this study in the ON and RTN point to a complex response to space-specific environmental insults. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking the observed transcriptomic changes to the development of pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities. Spaceflight stressors besides MG, including cosmic radiation, magnetic changes, hypergravity during transport, and other space-specific environmental influences, might all have effects on ocular health [31]. This study did not explicitly control for additional potential stressors, including hypergravity, cosmic radiation, and magnetic changes, in the HGC mice. Although MG and cosmic radiation are considered the primary sources of harmful effects during spaceflight [31], secondary sources such as hypergravity may have made minor contributions to the observed transcriptomic changes during spaceflight. Further, during a short, 30-day mission, the mice are only expected to be exposed to relatively low doses of cosmic radiation. However, there is evidence that MG and cosmic radiation may act synergistically [31]. The fact that there are relatively few DEGs and low 4-HNE staining at 0.67–1 G (Supplementary File S1: Figure S2a,b and Figure 6b, respectively) may therefore suggest either that spaceflight stressors other than MG did not have a major effect at all in this study, or that they did have a substantial effect synergistically with MG that was attenuated under substantial AG. Stressors like cosmic radiation are likely to be more substantial during spaceflight of a longer duration. It is possible that continuous AG above 0.67 G may help protect against the effects of MG and other spaceflight stressors during longer missions on the ISS, though this is speculative. It will be important in future studies to expose mice to a longer duration of spaceflight on the ISS to determine the effectiveness of AG in attenuating the effects of spaceflight stressors. In order for the collected data from the current study to be comparable to the data from past MHU missions [9,32,33], only male mice were used in this study. However, we recognize the importance of studying both sexes for space research to understand how sex and gender differences impact long-term health in astronauts. It will be important in future research to incorporate both male and female mice to better understand their differences in response to space-specific environmental stressors. In the present study, we observed increased 4-HNE activity in the retinal GCL of the FLT 0 G and 0.33 G groups. The exact cell types of the positive staining need to be further characterized by double staining with specific biomarkers. However, the morphology of these 4-HNE signals resembles Müller cell endfeet. Müller cells are glial cells in the retina that provide metabolic and homeostatic support to neurons and photoreceptors. Increased activation and hypertrophy of Müller cells occurs in a process called gliosis in response to retinal damage or stress [32,33]. The effect of retinal gliosis on neurodegeneration has been reported [34]. Reduced 4-HNE staining on Müller cells by higher doses of AG may indicate protective effects against the impact of MG on the retina by mechanisms of attenuating oxidative stress and altering Müller glial activation and gliosis processes.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Mouse Habitat Unit-8 and Mouse Groups A total of 24 male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed on Earth during a four-week period of acclimation to housing, food, and water conditions. The mice were then transferred to the Transportation Cage Unit (TCU) and launched at ~12 weeks of age from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-27 (Dragon) on 15 March 2023 (GMT) for a 30-day MHU-8 mission. Within 24 h after arriving at the ISS, the animals were individually housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) located in the Kibo centrifuge hardware Cell Biology Experimental Facility on the ISS. The 24 flight mice were subdivided into four groups. The first group of flight mice were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (0 G group), the second and third groups of flight mice were exposed to continuous AG of 0.33 G and 0.67 G, respectively, and the fourth group was exposed to continuous AG of 1 G. AG was achieved through the use of short-arm centrifuges for the duration of the MHU-8 mission, with only brief stoppages for husbandry and experimental procedures several times throughout the mission. The AG mice were subjected to AG immediately after being transferred to their HCUs. The rotation rates for generating 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G were 44 rpm, 63 rpm, and 77 rpm, respectively. The flight mice then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 2023, and returned to Earth alive. A total of 12 male C57BL/6J HGC mice from the same cohort as the FLT mice were also housed individually during a four-week period of acclimation and were then maintained in similar habitat conditions as the FLT mice, inside the ISSES Chambers, with operations conducted with a 3-day delay relative to the FLT mice. All FLT and HGC mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. Within 6 h of landing, all FLT mice were euthanized by inhalation of 3% isoflurane and then maintained at 1.5–2% for blood collection following euthanasia, and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. HGC mice were euthanized 3 days later by the same method. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of JAXA and NASA. No protocol was required from the Loma Linda University (LLU) IACUC, since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. The research with vertebrate animals was conducted in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America.4.2. Mouse Eye Tissue Harvest and Preservation After necropsy, mouse eyes were harvested. The left eyes from each experimental group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The retina and optic nerve of the right eyes were dissected out from the eye globe [35] and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction and RNA-seq.4.3. Retina RNA Extraction RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). A homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 retina tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and 900 μL of cold homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at a speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the Qubit RNA BR kit following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).4.4. Optic Nerve RNA Extraction RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. QIAzol was used as a homogenization buffer and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 optic nerve tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and cold QIAzol homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Qubit RNA BR or HS kits following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).4.5. Sequencing Library Construction ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Spike-in data were used for sample quality control. RNA ribo depletion and library preparation were conducted with Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Input RNA was approximately 100 ng with RIN > 4. For RTN samples FLT17 and FLT02, and ON samples FLT11, FLT21, FLT04, FLT23, FLT12, FLT02, and HGC05, RNA input was below 30 ng, and ERCC spike-in and quality control could not be performed for these samples. Unique dual index adapters (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used, and 12 cycles of PCR were performed using the BioRad C1000 Touch (BIO RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Pooled library concentration was measured by the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)). Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).4.6. Sequencing RNA sequencing was performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp; Index1: 17 bp; Index2: 8 bp; Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX Sequencing Control V3 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was included as a control and to increase library diversity. The protocol followed is the SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs (accessed on 27 June 2023)).4.7. RNA-Seq Data Analysis Raw fastq files were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) [36], and adaptors and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) [37] powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7) [38]. Trimmed fastq file quality was then evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) [39], and MultiQC (version 1.1.9) [11] was used to generate MultiQC reports. Trimmed fastq files were then mapped with STAR (version 2.7.10a) [40]. We used the Ensembl [41] release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) as a reference genome. The following gtf annotation file was used: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) [42,43]; then, aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1) [44], with strandedness set to reverse. Quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) [45] and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) [46]; all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4) [47,48,49], PANTHER.db (v1.0.11) [50,51,52], and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.15.0). Genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjusted p < 0.05 were selected as significant DEGs. PCA plots for the ON and RTN were made separately using the normalized gene expression data obtained from DESeq2. The analysis was done in R (version 4.0.3). The R function aov() [53] was used to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on each gene using each treatment as a factor, and genes with p < 0.05 were selected for input into the PCA. PCAs were performed using the R function PCA() [54,55,56]. Pathway analysis and plotting were performed separately on the ON and RTN DEGs (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) using R (version 4.0.3) with the enrichR package (version 3.2) [57,58]. setEnrichrSite(“Enrichr”) was used for performing general enrichment analysis. Only the KEGG_2019_Mouse [59] library was used for analysis.4.8. Comparison of DEGs Overlapping Between Spaceflight, Glaucoma, and Optic Nerve Crush Models Published glaucoma and optic nerve crush DEG tables (both relative to healthy controls) were obtained [12], and genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjusted p < 0.05 were taken to be significant. Separate lists were obtained for the ON and RTN, which contained DEGs at all time points observed in the study for both optic nerve crush and glaucoma models. Optic nerve crush and glaucoma DEGs in unmyelinated optic nerve (UON) and myelinated optic nerve (MON) were combined into a single list for the ON. We then determined the overlaps between spaceflight (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) DEGs in the ON and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in the ON, and similarly determined the overlaps between spaceflight DEGs in the RTN and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in RTN.4.9. Statistical Comparison of FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEG Overlaps For the ON and RTN separately, we counted the number of significant DEGs that changed in the same direction in the two comparisons (FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G) according to the log2 FC, and we similarly counted the number of DEGs that changed in the opposite direction. Let S = the number of DEGs changing in the same direction, O = the number of DEGs changing in the opposite direction, and n = S + O. We thus performed a binomial test using the function “binom.test” in R version 4.0.3, with x = S, n = N, and p = 0.5.4.10. Immunostaining for Oxidative Stress Biomarker Evaluation Paraffin-embedded sections (six µm) of the left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n = 5–6/group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using the 4-HNE antibody specific to lipid peroxidation (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA). Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. Six to ten field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, USA) at 20× magnification spanning the entire retina sections. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity (red channel for 4-HNE) was measured in these captured images of each section and calculated using ImageJ software (V1.53) [60]. The data were then extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group.5. Conclusions We conclude that adding artificial gravity by centrifugation on board the ISS, especially near 1 G, can significantly reduce transcriptomic alteration induced by spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Clearly, more research on the ocular response to microgravity and its interaction with other spaceflight physiological stressors is warranted. Further investigation will also be needed to extend the observation time after the animals return alive from the centrifugation study on the ISS.Acknowledgments This study was achieved based on the Japan–U.S. Open Plateform Partnership Program (JP-US OP3).

    "abstract": "Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities. Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p < 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in nominal conditions at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. To achieve the cell numbers needed for all the experimental conditions, primary frozen cell aliquots were subcultured for about 2 months prior to irradiation procedures. 4.2. Experimental Conditions Kasumi-3 cells were infected with a low dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1) of CMV (TB40/E strain) and allowed to establish latency (10 days of culture with monitored viral gene expression). Once CMV latency was established, 500,000 cells/mL were seeded in 25-cm2 (T-25) flasks and filled to capacity (70 mL) for transport to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Long Island, New York. Cell size, viability, and CMV viral load were determined from a pooled sample prior to transport and were regarded as pre-irradiation baselines (Day 2). Filtered flask caps were replaced with plug caps, tightened, and parafilm wrapped. Transport was overnight (≈18 h) from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to BNL. Once received at BNL, plug caps were loosened and flasks were kept upright in nominal incubator conditions overnight. The next day (irradiation day), duplicate flasks of the cells were exposed to acute doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) within each modeled radiation type (gamma, proton, carbon, iron, and GCRsim) at room temperature. Control flasks of mock-irradiated cells were also included and placed out of the incubator during radiation treatment. After irradiation, flasks were maintained in nominal incubator conditions overnight until transport back to the Johnson Space Center Immunology and Virology Laboratory (Houston, TX, USA) for analysis. Cells were then aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on Day 3 post-irradiation and then every three days following (i.e., Day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Except for Day 15 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 complete media. For each harvest, cells were split into 3 subsamples and then frozen for analysis of cell count and characterization, determination of CMV viral load, and next generation sequencing. 4.3. Irradiation Setup At NSRL, the cells were exposed to an acute dose of radiation (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) or sham-irradiated at room temperature. Radiation doses of 5 Gy repeatedly killed all the cells, thus were not used. Irradiations were performed using 13 s gamma rays, individual ions (150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon, and 600 MeV/n iron ions), and the simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRsim) beam. The irradiation times for gamma rays are given in Table 1. The ions used for the ion irradiation are detailed in Table 2. Table 1. 137Cs gamma ray irradiation settings.

For this experiment, the simplified GCRsim was used with the same total doses (10, 50, 100, and 200 cGy). The details of the beams, energies, dose rates, and irradiation times are given in Supplemental Document S1 (file Mehta NSRL 21B GCR 5-26-21 beam records Final). At the scale of the Kasumi-3 cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to consider the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, iron ions, and the simulated GCR by the Monte-Carlo simulation code RITRACKS [19] is shown in Figure 4. The details of these calculations, including the use of periodic boundary conditions, are described elsewhere [20,21]. The simulated volume is roughly the size of one Kasumi-3 cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.2 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between the tracks of different types of radiation. In Figure 4a, electron tracks corresponding to compton and photoelectron effects are observed. In Figure 4b, 230 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.54 keV/µm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. In Figure 4c, 14 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. In Figure 4d, only one track for 600 MeV/n iron ions is sufficient to yield a dose of ~0.2 Gy to the volume. In Figure 4e, the simulation of the irradiation by the GCR field is shown. Most of the tracks are proton and helium tracks. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by (a) 137Cs photons, (b) 150 MeV protons, (c) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, (d) 600 MeV/n iron ions, and (e) simulated GCR mixed field. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.2 Gy. 4.4. Cell Counts, Size, and Viability Aliquots from each flask were taken at each experimental day (Day 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15) and assessed for cell count (per mL), cell size (diameter in µm), and viability (percentage of live cells from total). Data were collected using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelcom, Lawrence, MA, USA). In brief, a homogeneous sample of each cell culture flask was removed and mixed 1:1 with acridine orange and propidium iodide solution (AOPI) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and plated on Cellometer SD100 disposable slides for analysis [9]. 4.5. Determination of CMV Viral Load Frozen cells were thawed and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from cell pellets with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Total DNA recovered from extractions was quantified by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Invitrogen™ Quant-iT™ Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CMV DNA was quantified by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a QuanStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Life technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Each reaction mix (20 µL) contained 6.6 µL DNA and 13.4 µL of master mix (2X TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 830 nM IE-EX4 Forward, 830 nM IE-EX4 Reverse, 300 nM IE-EX4 Probe, 830 nM gB Forward, 830 nM gB Reverse, 300 nM gB Probe, and water). Primer and probe sequences were synthesized by IDT, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) and are listed in Table 3. Each sample was run in duplicate, and results were averaged. A housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for the qPCR assays. Viral load results (copies/µL) from the two duplicates were averaged and then normalized by the total cell count. For whole number simplification, values were multiplied by 10,000 to achieve the final variable (CMV copies/10,000 cells) used for statistical analysis and presentation in this manuscript. Table 3.

Genomics and Transcriptomics Commercial vendors were used for sequencing the genomes and RNA from exposed and control cells. Samples (cells) were shipped in frozen state on dry ice to the vendor for processing. Standard protocols for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA were followed [22,23]. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from the samples and assessed for purity using fluorometric methods. The DNA, or cDNA (for transcriptomics), was used for library preparation. Nucleotides were read on an Illumina sequencer at a read length and depth that was considered appropriate for the current purpose of discovering nucleotide changes and transcript abundance. Data were analyzed on the Illumina Connected Software (https://help.connected.illumina.com/, 20 September 2024) and obtained as sequence files as well as datasheets containing relative quantities of transcripts. 4.7. Statistical Method Mixed models were applied to explore how CMV load, cell size, and viability change across days and different types of radiation and doses. To account for interactions between radiation type, dose, and days, mixed models with full three-way interaction terms were constructed. Random effects of flasks nested within radiation type were incorporated to address repeated measures. Robust standard errors were used to allow for non-homogeneous variance across time. The outcomes were assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Multiple comparisons between each group and the control group were adjusted using either simulation or the Bonferroni method. The alpha level was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS 9.4. We conducted tests based on the mixed model described above. Specifically, we first compared each dose of radiation against the control group. Then, we compared the average of all radiation groups against the control group. Finally, we compared each dose against the control at each day post-radiation.",

All bars are mean ± SEM. 2.1. Viral Load Viral copy number is used to determine whether actual viral replication occurs from radiation as compared with the controls (non-irradiated cells but traveled to and from BNL with the irradiated cells). When analyzing all radiation sources together (Figure 1(A1)), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy CMV viral loads were significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared with controls throughout the entire experiment but also increased in the following order: control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0. As shown in Figure 1(A1), the post-irradiation viral load in the CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells decreased in controls as well as in all four radiation doses as compared with the pre-irradiation values (a separate set of the flasks for individual types of radiation but not irradiated). However, when the data were analyzed by timepoint (regardless of dose) (Figure 1(A2)), control and radiation both increased (non-significantly) post-radiation at Day 3 from an average of 18.27 to 23.53 and 22.21 copies/10,000 cells, respectively, and then tapered off as the experiment went on. Differences in viral load between control and radiation did not significantly occur until Day 12 (5.8 vs. 8.8 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.001) and Day 15 (5.2 vs. 8.2 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.01) (Figure 1(A2)). Within Day 12 and Day 15 (Figure 1(A3)), CMV viral load increased sequentially as dose increased, with all doses significantly different from control except for 0.1 Gy at Day 15. When sorting out the data from each radiation source, proton and gamma showed an increase in CMV viral load at Day 3 post-irradiation compared with the pre-irradiation samples (Figure 1(D2,E2)). All other radiation types, carbon, iron, and GCRsim, showed a decrease at Day 3 post-irradiation from their pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1(B2,C2,F2)). However, when analyzing irradiated samples by dose (Figure 1-column 1) compared with the controls, all radiation sources (except gamma) showed significant increases of CMV viral load, with the most increases seen in iron ion radiation at 2.0 Gy (+4.50 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(C1)) and carbon 2.0 Gy (+2.87 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(B1)). As mentioned previously, when analyzed according to different time points post-irradiation (Figure 1-column 2), the viral load increased or was roughly the same as the pre-irradiation values and then started to decrease on Days 6, 9, 12, and 15 for all the radiation sources. Significant differences compared with controls were found in proton and GCRsim at Day 9 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(E2,F2)) and carbon and iron at Day 12 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(B2,C2)). We also compared the results of viral load post each irradiation type and at each timepoint with their own respective controls (Figure 1-column 3). Viral load values were consistently higher post-radiation as compared with the control samples at each time point for all the experiments except for carbon and iron on Day 9 (Figure 1(B3,C3)) and gamma on Day 3 (Figure 1(D3)), which showed a decrease post-irradiation. A significant increase was observed 12 days post-irradiation for all sources as compared with their controls (Figure 1(A3)). For individual radiation types, carbon and iron showed an effect 3 days and beyond post-radiation (Figure 1(B3,C3)), while proton and GCRsim did not show any significant effect until 9 days post-irradiation (Figure 1(E3,F3)). Gamma did show an increasing trend, but this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 1(D3)). 2.2. Cell Viability The cell viability was 86.3 to 89.9% before the cells were transported to NSRL (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). The trauma of transport negatively affected cell viability of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV, as evidenced by the substantial reduction in live cells in the control conditions (Figure 2). Radiation further significantly reduced the viability at all the dosages in an increasing order (control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0) when compared with the controls for all sources (Figure 2(A1)). As represented in Figure 2(A2), the viability started to recover 9 days post-irradiation (controls: 70.25 ± 2.20%; radiation: 58.39 ± 2.12%) as compared with Day 3 (controls: 44.56 ± 2.57%; radiation: 41.89 ± 1.00%) and Day 6 (controls: 43.23 ± 1.86%; radiation: 39.96 ± 1.10%). The irradiated groups were significantly less viable than their corresponding controls at each timepoint (p < 0.001) except for Day 6 (Figure 2(A2)). The biggest fall was found at 2.0 Gy irradiation compared with controls at every timepoint analyzed (p < 0.001, Figure 2(A3)). When sorting out each radiation source, proton and gamma showed the least reduction in viability compared with controls (max reduction at 2.0 Gy: proton = −5.94%, Figure 2(E1), and gamma = −10.93%, Figure 2(D1)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim (except GCRsim 0.1 Gy, Figure 2(B1,C1,F1)) all showed significant decreases in cell viability compared with controls, with the most decreases seen in iron 2.0 Gy (−26.42%) and carbon 2.0 Gy (−17.81%). Proton and gamma radiation had significant reductions in viability at Day 12 (p < 0.01, Figure 2(D2,E2)), which were driven in large part by the higher dose radiations at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 2(D3,E3)). Gamma radiation also had a significant reduction in viability at Day 15 (p < 0.001, Figure 2(D2)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had significant reductions in viability at Days 9 and 12 (Figure 2(B2,C2,F2)), with the higher doses contributing to that the most (Figure 2(B3,C3,F3)). Carbon and iron also had reductions in viability at Days 3 and 15 (Figure 2(B2,C2)). 2.3. Cell Size The normal size of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV is around 9.0 µm. In our data set, pre-irradiation cell size ranged from 9.2 to 9.4 µm (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). Post-irradiation saw a general increase in the size of these cells as compared with their respective controls for all the sources (Figure 3(A1)). However, a significant increase was only found at 2.0 Gy irradiation dose for all the sources (9.5 ± 0.1 to 10.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001, Figure 3(A1)), but is evident by the fact that each individual radiation source had a significant cell size increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1–E1)). For individual sources, iron showed a significant increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(C1)), carbon showed at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1)), gamma was significant at all doses (Figure 3(D1)), proton showed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(E1)), and GCRsim showed at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(F1)), respectively. It was interesting to notice that this increase was observed 9 days post-irradiation for all sources (Figure 3(A2)) and at individual sources gamma and protons (Figure 3(D2,E2)). For post-GCRsim irradiation treatment, an increase in cell size was apparent even three days after treatment for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 3(E2,E3)). Similar to the other individual radiation sources, GCRsim cell sizes also increased at Day 9 (Figure 3(E2)), which coincided with a dose of 2.0 Gy having statistical significance, which continued into Day 12s and 15 (Figure 3(E3)). 2.4. Genomics Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study. 2.5. Transcriptomics The TNA recovered from this study was also examined for differences in transcriptional activity of the CMV genome in the irradiated and unirradiated groups. Data from the GCR-Day 6 cells compared with mock-exposed cells indicate that differential expression seems to be occurring, but these changes do not register as statistically significant (Supplemental Document S2). However, the UL49 sequence shows a significant (p < 0.026) increase in expression reflected as log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48, summarized in Supplemental Document S1.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [9]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In the current study, we tested the effect of carbon, iron, proton, gamma, and GCRsim individually across several doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on CMV viral load, genomics, and transcriptomics. The CMV viral load in the infected Kasumi cells, taken as a whole, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with increases seen at Day 3 at all the dosages tested, which tapered off through Day 15. However, at Days 12 and 15, the most significant viral load changes were seen at almost all doses compared with their corresponding controls. Surprisingly, however, carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had viral loads at Day 3 in controls and radiation groups that were either similar to or less than their respective pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1). Additionally, no radiation (at any dose) produced an increase in CMV at Day 3 or Day 6 compared with the control samples. In other words, if an increase in CMV viral load was seen early on for post-irradiation cells, it also occurred in the control flasks. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the loss of cell viability resulting from cell transport from JSC to NSRL. Cells experience harsh conditions at the loading docks before and after shipping, including suboptimal temperature, humidity, and %CO2. Ideally, cell cultures would be undisturbed outside of experimental conditions, sample aliquoting, and media changes. However, with the NSRL facility located in New York, it was not feasible to do the many months-long pre-irradiation cell culture and infections outside our primary NASA facility at JSC. Based on our previous experiments using the latently infected EBV Akata cells, we did not anticipate such dampening of the experimental findings from the logistics of travel. We found that the cell viability decreased from 88.33% (before radiation) to 44.56% in controls and 41.89% in the irradiated groups (at Day 3 after radiation), accounting for a significant drop in the live cell count and, in turn, viral load. Even though the cell viability recovered after irradiation, the cell numbers never returned to the pre-irradiation levels. Even so, as the cells “settled down” and returned to the regulated physico-chemical conditions over time, differences between the controls and the radiation samples became apparent, as evidenced by the significant viral loads during the experimental timeline (particularly Days 12 and 15). The most significant increase in the CMV load as compared with their corresponding controls was found at Day 9 for post-proton and GCRsim irradiations, at 12 days post-iron and carbon irradiations, and at Day 15 for carbon, iron, and GCRsim. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. Even though EBV and CMV are both herpesviruses, their replication and response mechanisms are expected to be different. Additionally, the Akata cell line (B-cell lymphoma) and the Kasumi-3 cell line (myeloblast leukemia) are different, and it may be that the Akata cells are just a more robust cell line and can handle perturbations in the cell culture conditions more easily. Not surprisingly, then, in normal human immunology, cells of the myeloid lineage generally have a shorter lifespan and faster turnover rate (days to weeks) than cells of the lymphoid system (weeks to months) [11,12]. Future studies should limit dyshomeostasis to the cell culture system or use a more stable model (in vivo or in vitro) to confirm these results. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells (Supplemental Document S2). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48, p value 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [13]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [9]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [14]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [15]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [16]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [17] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions It is undeniable that herpesviruses reactivate from latency upon space travel. The cause of this reactivation is complicated and likely multifold. In this study on CMV (and our previous one with EBV), we show that space radiation has a direct effect on the reactivation of herpesviruses.",

Copyright notice ID: 11477029 PMID: 39408667 Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members. Keywords: cytomegalovirus, radiation, galactic cosmic radiation, spaceflight, herpes viral reactivation1. Introduction Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities. Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p < 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49.2. Results Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 present changes in the mean of CMV viral load in copies/10,000 cells (Figure 1), cell viability in live cell percentages (Figure 2), and cell size in µm (Figure 3) of CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells before and after irradiation with carbon, iron, gamma, proton, and GCRsim.

All bars are mean ± SEM.2.1. Viral Load Viral copy number is used to determine whether actual viral replication occurs from radiation as compared with the controls (non-irradiated cells but traveled to and from BNL with the irradiated cells). When analyzing all radiation sources together (Figure 1(A1)), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy CMV viral loads were significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared with controls throughout the entire experiment but also increased in the following order: control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0. As shown in Figure 1(A1), the post-irradiation viral load in the CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells decreased in controls as well as in all four radiation doses as compared with the pre-irradiation values (a separate set of the flasks for individual types of radiation but not irradiated). However, when the data were analyzed by timepoint (regardless of dose) (Figure 1(A2)), control and radiation both increased (non-significantly) post-radiation at Day 3 from an average of 18.27 to 23.53 and 22.21 copies/10,000 cells, respectively, and then tapered off as the experiment went on. Differences in viral load between control and radiation did not significantly occur until Day 12 (5.8 vs. 8.8 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.001) and Day 15 (5.2 vs. 8.2 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.01) (Figure 1(A2)). Within Day 12 and Day 15 (Figure 1(A3)), CMV viral load increased sequentially as dose increased, with all doses significantly different from control except for 0.1 Gy at Day 15. When sorting out the data from each radiation source, proton and gamma showed an increase in CMV viral load at Day 3 post-irradiation compared with the pre-irradiation samples (Figure 1(D2,E2)). All other radiation types, carbon, iron, and GCRsim, showed a decrease at Day 3 post-irradiation from their pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1(B2,C2,F2)). However, when analyzing irradiated samples by dose (Figure 1-column 1) compared with the controls, all radiation sources (except gamma) showed significant increases of CMV viral load, with the most increases seen in iron ion radiation at 2.0 Gy (+4.50 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(C1)) and carbon 2.0 Gy (+2.87 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1(B1)). As mentioned previously, when analyzed according to different time points post-irradiation (Figure 1-column 2), the viral load increased or was roughly the same as the pre-irradiation values and then started to decrease on Days 6, 9, 12, and 15 for all the radiation sources. Significant differences compared with controls were found in proton and GCRsim at Day 9 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(E2,F2)) and carbon and iron at Day 12 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1(B2,C2)). We also compared the results of viral load post each irradiation type and at each timepoint with their own respective controls (Figure 1-column 3). Viral load values were consistently higher post-radiation as compared with the control samples at each time point for all the experiments except for carbon and iron on Day 9 (Figure 1(B3,C3)) and gamma on Day 3 (Figure 1(D3)), which showed a decrease post-irradiation. A significant increase was observed 12 days post-irradiation for all sources as compared with their controls (Figure 1(A3)). For individual radiation types, carbon and iron showed an effect 3 days and beyond post-radiation (Figure 1(B3,C3)), while proton and GCRsim did not show any significant effect until 9 days post-irradiation (Figure 1(E3,F3)). Gamma did show an increasing trend, but this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 1(D3)).2.2. Cell Viability The cell viability was 86.3 to 89.9% before the cells were transported to NSRL (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). The trauma of transport negatively affected cell viability of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV, as evidenced by the substantial reduction in live cells in the control conditions (Figure 2). Radiation further significantly reduced the viability at all the dosages in an increasing order (control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0) when compared with the controls for all sources (Figure 2(A1)). As represented in Figure 2(A2), the viability started to recover 9 days post-irradiation (controls: 70.25 ± 2.20%; radiation: 58.39 ± 2.12%) as compared with Day 3 (controls: 44.56 ± 2.57%; radiation: 41.89 ± 1.00%) and Day 6 (controls: 43.23 ± 1.86%; radiation: 39.96 ± 1.10%). The irradiated groups were significantly less viable than their corresponding controls at each timepoint (p < 0.001) except for Day 6 (Figure 2(A2)). The biggest fall was found at 2.0 Gy irradiation compared with controls at every timepoint analyzed (p < 0.001, Figure 2(A3)). When sorting out each radiation source, proton and gamma showed the least reduction in viability compared with controls (max reduction at 2.0 Gy: proton = −5.94%, Figure 2(E1), and gamma = −10.93%, Figure 2(D1)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim (except GCRsim 0.1 Gy, Figure 2(B1,C1,F1)) all showed significant decreases in cell viability compared with controls, with the most decreases seen in iron 2.0 Gy (−26.42%) and carbon 2.0 Gy (−17.81%). Proton and gamma radiation had significant reductions in viability at Day 12 (p < 0.01, Figure 2(D2,E2)), which were driven in large part by the higher dose radiations at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 2(D3,E3)). Gamma radiation also had a significant reduction in viability at Day 15 (p < 0.001, Figure 2(D2)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had significant reductions in viability at Days 9 and 12 (Figure 2(B2,C2,F2)), with the higher doses contributing to that the most (Figure 2(B3,C3,F3)). Carbon and iron also had reductions in viability at Days 3 and 15 (Figure 2(B2,C2)).2.3. Cell Size The normal size of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV is around 9.0 µm. In our data set, pre-irradiation cell size ranged from 9.2 to 9.4 µm (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). Post-irradiation saw a general increase in the size of these cells as compared with their respective controls for all the sources (Figure 3(A1)). However, a significant increase was only found at 2.0 Gy irradiation dose for all the sources (9.5 ± 0.1 to 10.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001, Figure 3(A1)), but is evident by the fact that each individual radiation source had a significant cell size increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1–E1)). For individual sources, iron showed a significant increase at 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(C1)), carbon showed at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(B1)), gamma was significant at all doses (Figure 3(D1)), proton showed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(E1)), and GCRsim showed at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy (Figure 3(F1)), respectively. It was interesting to notice that this increase was observed 9 days post-irradiation for all sources (Figure 3(A2)) and at individual sources gamma and protons (Figure 3(D2,E2)). For post-GCRsim irradiation treatment, an increase in cell size was apparent even three days after treatment for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 3(E2,E3)). Similar to the other individual radiation sources, GCRsim cell sizes also increased at Day 9 (Figure 3(E2)), which coincided with a dose of 2.0 Gy having statistical significance, which continued into Day 12s and 15 (Figure 3(E3)).2.4. Genomics Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study.2.5. Transcriptomics The TNA recovered from this study was also examined for differences in transcriptional activity of the CMV genome in the irradiated and unirradiated groups. Data from the GCR-Day 6 cells compared with mock-exposed cells indicate that differential expression seems to be occurring, but these changes do not register as statistically significant (Supplemental Document S2). However, the UL49 sequence shows a significant (p < 0.026) increase in expression reflected as log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48, summarized in Supplemental Document S1.3. Discussion Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [9]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In the current study, we tested the effect of carbon, iron, proton, gamma, and GCRsim individually across several doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on CMV viral load, genomics, and transcriptomics. The CMV viral load in the infected Kasumi cells, taken as a whole, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with increases seen at Day 3 at all the dosages tested, which tapered off through Day 15. However, at Days 12 and 15, the most significant viral load changes were seen at almost all doses compared with their corresponding controls. Surprisingly, however, carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had viral loads at Day 3 in controls and radiation groups that were either similar to or less than their respective pre-irradiation levels (Figure 1). Additionally, no radiation (at any dose) produced an increase in CMV at Day 3 or Day 6 compared with the control samples. In other words, if an increase in CMV viral load was seen early on for post-irradiation cells, it also occurred in the control flasks. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the loss of cell viability resulting from cell transport from JSC to NSRL. Cells experience harsh conditions at the loading docks before and after shipping, including suboptimal temperature, humidity, and %CO2. Ideally, cell cultures would be undisturbed outside of experimental conditions, sample aliquoting, and media changes. However, with the NSRL facility located in New York, it was not feasible to do the many months-long pre-irradiation cell culture and infections outside our primary NASA facility at JSC. Based on our previous experiments using the latently infected EBV Akata cells, we did not anticipate such dampening of the experimental findings from the logistics of travel. We found that the cell viability decreased from 88.33% (before radiation) to 44.56% in controls and 41.89% in the irradiated groups (at Day 3 after radiation), accounting for a significant drop in the live cell count and, in turn, viral load. Even though the cell viability recovered after irradiation, the cell numbers never returned to the pre-irradiation levels. Even so, as the cells “settled down” and returned to the regulated physico-chemical conditions over time, differences between the controls and the radiation samples became apparent, as evidenced by the significant viral loads during the experimental timeline (particularly Days 12 and 15). The most significant increase in the CMV load as compared with their corresponding controls was found at Day 9 for post-proton and GCRsim irradiations, at 12 days post-iron and carbon irradiations, and at Day 15 for carbon, iron, and GCRsim. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. Even though EBV and CMV are both herpesviruses, their replication and response mechanisms are expected to be different. Additionally, the Akata cell line (B-cell lymphoma) and the Kasumi-3 cell line (myeloblast leukemia) are different, and it may be that the Akata cells are just a more robust cell line and can handle perturbations in the cell culture conditions more easily. Not surprisingly, then, in normal human immunology, cells of the myeloid lineage generally have a shorter lifespan and faster turnover rate (days to weeks) than cells of the lymphoid system (weeks to months) [11,12]. Future studies should limit dyshomeostasis to the cell culture system or use a more stable model (in vivo or in vitro) to confirm these results. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells (Supplemental Document S2). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48, p value 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [13]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [9]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [14]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [15]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [16]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [17] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in nominal conditions at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. To achieve the cell numbers needed for all the experimental conditions, primary frozen cell aliquots were subcultured for about 2 months prior to irradiation procedures.4.2. Experimental Conditions Kasumi-3 cells were infected with a low dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1) of CMV (TB40/E strain) and allowed to establish latency (10 days of culture with monitored viral gene expression). Once CMV latency was established, 500,000 cells/mL were seeded in 25-cm2 (T-25) flasks and filled to capacity (70 mL) for transport to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Long Island, New York. Cell size, viability, and CMV viral load were determined from a pooled sample prior to transport and were regarded as pre-irradiation baselines (Day 2). Filtered flask caps were replaced with plug caps, tightened, and parafilm wrapped. Transport was overnight (≈18 h) from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to BNL. Once received at BNL, plug caps were loosened and flasks were kept upright in nominal incubator conditions overnight. The next day (irradiation day), duplicate flasks of the cells were exposed to acute doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) within each modeled radiation type (gamma, proton, carbon, iron, and GCRsim) at room temperature. Control flasks of mock-irradiated cells were also included and placed out of the incubator during radiation treatment. After irradiation, flasks were maintained in nominal incubator conditions overnight until transport back to the Johnson Space Center Immunology and Virology Laboratory (Houston, TX, USA) for analysis. Cells were then aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on Day 3 post-irradiation and then every three days following (i.e., Day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Except for Day 15 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 complete media. For each harvest, cells were split into 3 subsamples and then frozen for analysis of cell count and characterization, determination of CMV viral load, and next generation sequencing.4.3. Irradiation Setup At NSRL, the cells were exposed to an acute dose of radiation (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) or sham-irradiated at room temperature. Radiation doses of 5 Gy repeatedly killed all the cells, thus were not used. Irradiations were performed using 13 s gamma rays, individual ions (150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon, and 600 MeV/n iron ions), and the simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRsim) beam. The irradiation times for gamma rays are given in Table 1. The ions used for the ion irradiation are detailed in Table 2. Table 1. 137Cs gamma ray irradiation settings.

For this experiment, the simplified GCRsim was used with the same total doses (10, 50, 100, and 200 cGy). The details of the beams, energies, dose rates, and irradiation times are given in Supplemental Document S1 (file Mehta NSRL 21B GCR 5-26-21 beam records Final). At the scale of the Kasumi-3 cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to consider the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, iron ions, and the simulated GCR by the Monte-Carlo simulation code RITRACKS [19] is shown in Figure 4. The details of these calculations, including the use of periodic boundary conditions, are described elsewhere [20,21]. The simulated volume is roughly the size of one Kasumi-3 cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.2 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between the tracks of different types of radiation. In Figure 4a, electron tracks corresponding to compton and photoelectron effects are observed. In Figure 4b, 230 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.54 keV/µm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. In Figure 4c, 14 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. In Figure 4d, only one track for 600 MeV/n iron ions is sufficient to yield a dose of ~0.2 Gy to the volume. In Figure 4e, the simulation of the irradiation by the GCR field is shown. Most of the tracks are proton and helium tracks. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by (a) 137Cs photons, (b) 150 MeV protons, (c) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, (d) 600 MeV/n iron ions, and (e) simulated GCR mixed field. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.2 Gy.4.4. Cell Counts, Size, and Viability Aliquots from each flask were taken at each experimental day (Day 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15) and assessed for cell count (per mL), cell size (diameter in µm), and viability (percentage of live cells from total). Data were collected using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelcom, Lawrence, MA, USA). In brief, a homogeneous sample of each cell culture flask was removed and mixed 1:1 with acridine orange and propidium iodide solution (AOPI) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and plated on Cellometer SD100 disposable slides for analysis [9].4.5. Determination of CMV Viral Load Frozen cells were thawed and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from cell pellets with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Total DNA recovered from extractions was quantified by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Invitrogen™ Quant-iT™ Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CMV DNA was quantified by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a QuanStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Life technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). Each reaction mix (20 µL) contained 6.6 µL DNA and 13.4 µL of master mix (2X TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 830 nM IE-EX4 Forward, 830 nM IE-EX4 Reverse, 300 nM IE-EX4 Probe, 830 nM gB Forward, 830 nM gB Reverse, 300 nM gB Probe, and water). Primer and probe sequences were synthesized by IDT, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) and are listed in Table 3. Each sample was run in duplicate, and results were averaged. A housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for the qPCR assays. Viral load results (copies/µL) from the two duplicates were averaged and then normalized by the total cell count. For whole number simplification, values were multiplied by 10,000 to achieve the final variable (CMV copies/10,000 cells) used for statistical analysis and presentation in this manuscript. Table 3.

Genomics and Transcriptomics Commercial vendors were used for sequencing the genomes and RNA from exposed and control cells. Samples (cells) were shipped in frozen state on dry ice to the vendor for processing. Standard protocols for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA were followed [22,23]. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from the samples and assessed for purity using fluorometric methods. The DNA, or cDNA (for transcriptomics), was used for library preparation. Nucleotides were read on an Illumina sequencer at a read length and depth that was considered appropriate for the current purpose of discovering nucleotide changes and transcript abundance. Data were analyzed on the Illumina Connected Software (https://help.connected.illumina.com/, 20 September 2024) and obtained as sequence files as well as datasheets containing relative quantities of transcripts.4.7. Statistical Method Mixed models were applied to explore how CMV load, cell size, and viability change across days and different types of radiation and doses. To account for interactions between radiation type, dose, and days, mixed models with full three-way interaction terms were constructed. Random effects of flasks nested within radiation type were incorporated to address repeated measures. Robust standard errors were used to allow for non-homogeneous variance across time. The outcomes were assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Multiple comparisons between each group and the control group were adjusted using either simulation or the Bonferroni method. The alpha level was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS 9.4. We conducted tests based on the mixed model described above. Specifically, we first compared each dose of radiation against the control group. Then, we compared the average of all radiation groups against the control group. Finally, we compared each dose against the control at each day post-radiation.5. Conclusions It is undeniable that herpesviruses reactivate from latency upon space travel. The cause of this reactivation is complicated and likely multifold. In this study on CMV (and our previous one with EBV), we show that space radiation has a direct effect on the reactivation of herpesviruses.Acknowledgments The authors are thankful to Peter Guida and Paula Bennett from Brookhaven National Laboratory for helping with the irradiation experiments during the study under the NASA Space Radiation Program.

    "title": "Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/",
    "abstract": "Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Subject terms: Cytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria",
    "introduction": "Introduction Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9. unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11 (WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genome contains a single unc-89 gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26. Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability of C. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication.",

    "results": "Results Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected to result in instability A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST confirmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinases). The DMT class takes its name from their representative Death-associated-protein kinases (DAPKs), Myosin light-chain-kinases (MLCKs), and Triple functional domain protein-related kinases (TRIO) and contains, in addition, various muscle kinases including human titin kinase, nematode twitchin kinase (TwcK) and mammalian obscurin and SPEG kinases32. The BLAST search revealed that PK2 shares the highest sequence identity levels with DAPKs, TwcK, and MLCK (Supplementary Fig. 1). DAPK, TwcK, and MLCK kinases are proven to be catalytically active and their phosphotransfer has been characterized33–35. Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Specifically, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involved in ATP-binding, an AAK motif in β-strand β3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms a salt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committed state of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residue chelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartate and a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordination), both in the catalytic loop motif36,37. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK1138, TP53RK39, and mouse obscurin PK228 contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively. Fig. 1.

Bottom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs. unc-89(sf22). The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are ~800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspecific reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies46.During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC-89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness36. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement31,32. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable, we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldX v441. This yielded a calculated comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, of −0.15 kcal/mol and indicated that no significant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. To summarize, UNC-89-PK2 is modeled by Alphafold in a catalytically-primed conformational state compatible with kinase activity, the active site comprises the essential functional groups necessary for phosphor-transfer and the introduced mutation is not expected to cause structural instability. Taken together, bioinformatics analysis indicates that UNC-89-PK2 is a canonical, active kinase and that the observed nematode phenotype in this work results from hindered phosphor-transfer by PK2 resulting from the inactivating KtoA mutation. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move faster than wild-type nematodes We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm (Fig. 1d), unc-89(sf22), in which PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-target mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody10. Surprisingly, unlike all other unc-89 mutants, unc-89(sf22) worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostaining using antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for the base of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, and F-actin for I-bands (Fig. 2a–c). Detection and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, the normal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major loss of the mutant UNC-89 protein. To examine the myofilament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As shown in Fig. 2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres in unc-89(sf22) and in unc-89(syb1360), a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin filaments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Fig. 2. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure. Open in a new tab a The drawing on the right shows a cross-section through an adult worm indicating that the body wall muscle is organized into four quadrants. Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells (23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myofilament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick filaments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin filaments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs). The black oval indicates the plane viewed when an animal, lying on a glass slide, is examined by light microscopy as shown in part (c).

Note that there is no difference in the pattern of localization of these sarcomeric markers between wild type and unc-89(sf22). Scale bars, 10 μm. d Transmission EM of body wall muscle from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and a second independently-generated PK2 KtoA mutant, unc-89(syb1360). Bottom row displays the enlargement of one portion of the image above it. Yellow arrows, M-lines; yellow arrowheads, dense bodies, green arrows, SR. There is no discernible difference between the wild type and the two mutants in terms of numbers and organization of thick and thin filaments, M-lines, dense bodies, and SR. Scale bars, 0.5 μm.Because deficiency of mouse obscurin23 and worm UNC-8924 result in disorganized SR, we examined SR organization using the marker UNC-68 (Ryanodine receptor). However, HA-tagged UNC-68 endogenously expressed from a CRISPR/Cas9 strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a), or myc-tagged UNC-68 overexpressed from a transgene (Supplementary Fig. 4b) show normal localization in unc-89(sf22). Obscurin is also required for normal microtubule organization42. However, we found no difference in microtubule organization comparing wild type vs. unc-89(sf22), using a transgenic line expressing TBA-1 (α-tubulin) tagged with HA (Supplementary Fig. 5). unc-89 is also expressed in the single sarcomere muscle cells of the pharynx. UNC-89 is normally localized to the middle of the A-bands of pharyngeal sarcomeres8,10. All previously characterized unc-89 mutants, except for unc-89(tm752), have abnormally organized filaments as observed by polarized light or immunostaining6,9,11, with characteristic arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, both unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) display normal pharyngeal muscle as assessed by staining with anti-UNC-89 and the pharyngeal muscle-specific MHC C. Nearly all previously characterized unc-89 mutants have reduced whole animal locomotion and generate reduced maximal force9, most likely because sarcomere disorganization results in reduced muscle activity. The one known exception is unc-89(ad539), but this mutant only affects the organization of the pharyngeal muscle. Two independently derived UNC-89 KtoA mutants, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360), crawl faster than wild-type worms on an agar surface (Fig. 3a), and generate the same amount of maximal force43 as wild type (Fig. 3b).

Nematodes expressing UNC-89 PK2 KtoA, or an unc-89 mutant lacking expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, have fragmented mitochondria Blondelle et al.30 created a mouse doubly knocked out for both obscurin and obsl1 and demonstrated that by proteome analysis, these mice have changes in metabolic pathways, including decreased levels of nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others44. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105)45 have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms8,11(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig2624,46, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig3946, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria. Fig. 4. Body wall muscle cells of UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Open in a new tab a Confocal images of body wall muscle stained with antibodies to ATP5A to reveal the morphology of mitochondria. Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as “tubular”. In contrast, unc-89(sf22) which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, and unc-89(tm752) which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear as dots or can be described as fragmented. By comparison, unc-89(e1460) which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, and unc-89(su75) which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear more tubular or more like wild type. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicated strains. Note the presence of linear or tubular mitochondria in wild type and unc-89(e1460) and fragmented mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752). c, d Three additional independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutants (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) show fragmented mitochondria. Scale bars, 10 μm in (a and c); 5 μm in (b and d).Because CRISPR/Cas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change. sf22 and sf24 are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, and syb1195 and syb1360 are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type. The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation as unc-89(sf22) worms (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology. In PK2 KtoA mutants, mitochondrial fragmentation results from greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria In C. elegans, mitochondrial fusion and fission are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44 (Fig. 5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); fission is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited to mitochondria where it forms a large spiral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously47(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. Fig. 5. drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). Open in a new tab a Mitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion and fission, through the actions of several conserved GTPases of the dynamin family. The names of the nematode proteins are indicated with their mammalian orthologs shown in parentheses. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria stained with anti-ATP5A. The drp-1 null mutant shows abnormally clumped mitochondria, whereas unc-89(sf22) shows fragmented (smaller) mitochondria. The double mutant, unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) shows the Drp-1 single mutant phenotype. Scale bar, 5 μm.In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, fission is promoted48. We tested the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which unc-89 KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmentation is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c). Therefore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at least partially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are more fragmented. Fig. 6. More DRP-1 is associated with UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutant mitochondria as compared to wild-type mitochondria.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Because mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased respiration and ATP production49,50, we compared levels of ATP in wild type vs. each of the 4 PK2 KtoA mutant alleles. Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to find that each mutant shows at least a 40% increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status51. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells52,53. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm)54. The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels55. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions. Fig. 7. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated ATP levels. Open in a new tab Results of luciferase assays on extracts of whole worms from the indicated strains. For each strain, n = 3, and *: p < 0.05 by Dunnett’s test. Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled in unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondrial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type in C. elegans56 to isolate mitochondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from the myo-3 promoter, total mitochondria were purified, and then mostly muscle-specific mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in muscle mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-based respiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex I induced respiration (addition of substrates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria from unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) showed significantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupled by adding FCCP (Fig. 8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respiration (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncoupled (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8. PK2 KtoA mutants display altered mitochondrial respiration and altered levels of some electron transport chain complexes. Open in a new tab a, b Muscle mitochondria from PK2 KtoA mutants have increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration and each cannot be uncoupled. a Complex I (glutamate and malate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 3–8 per strain). b Complex II (succinate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 4–5 per strain). Means and standard errors of the mean are represented. Significance was tested by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.005, ***p ≤ 0.0005, ****p ≤ 0.00005. c, d PK2 KtoA mutants have altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. c Representative western blots reacted against antibodies to the indicated components of complexes I, II, IV, V, and cytochrome C. d Quantitation of these results with n = 3. au: arbitrary units. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Note that as compared to wild type, complexes I and V are normal, but complexes II and IV are reduced, and cytochrome C is elevated in the PK2 KtoA mutants.To gain insight into why complex I respiration is increased and complex II respiration is decreased, we assessed the protein levels of one component of each electron chain complex by western blots. Unfortunately, we could not identify a commercially available antibody that reacted against a complex III component, so complex III was not assessed. As shown in Fig. 8c, d, the levels of complexes I and V are normal, complexes II and IV are decreased, and cytochrome C (which shunts electrons from III to IV) is increased. These results only partially explain why complex II-based respiration is decreased. Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partially explain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we explored the additional possibility that glycolysis was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycolysis when mitochondria do not perform well57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is significantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig. 9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Fig. 9. PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase.

Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig. 8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs)58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles59. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig. 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study. Fig. 10. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated levels of UCP-4 protein but not mRNA. Open in a new tab a Representative western blot reacted with anti-HA to detect UCP-4-HA.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria Since the presumed inactivation of PK2 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation we wondered what would happen if the activity of PK2 was increased. We tested this by overexpressing a portion of UNC-89 containing wild-type PK2. We reported that a segment consisting of the C-terminal third of the interkinase region followed by Ig53, Fn2, and PK2 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-Pk2), when transgenically expressed from a heat shock promoter localizes to the M-line, the normal location of UNC-8946. This strain and wild type, as day 1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30° for 2 h, and then immunostained using anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, although mitochondria from the wild type showed the expected linear/tubular organization, mitochondria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clumping. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1, but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are fragmented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission60. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it48. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity. That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into the mitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins, C. elegans expresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoA mutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2 KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2. Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria61. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the first to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al.63 demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function49,64. However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission65. Feng et al.66 reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle67. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.",

Copyright notice ID: 11487192 PMID: 39420071 Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production. Subject terms: Cytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria UNC-89, a giant protein localized to muscle sarcomeres, contains 2 protein kinase domains, one of which, PK2 is a canonical kinase. A missense mutation expected to inactivate PK2 results in worms with an unexpected phenotype suggesting signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria.Introduction Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9. unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11 (WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genome contains a single unc-89 gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26. Substrates for UNC-89 PK2 have not yet been identified and an understanding of the in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of obscurin is in its infancy. However, sequence analysis suggests that human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases27, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro28. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro28. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK129. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)30. Specifically, nearly all mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins were downregulated. Analysis of the proteome data suggested downregulation of ETC proteins was more associated with loss of obscurin than with Obsl1. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. So far, the experiments on obscurin have utilized a knockout of the entire protein, not specifically eliminating the activity of one or more kinase domains. Taking advantage of the genetic manipulability of C. elegans, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm that expresses UNC-89 having the established kinase inactivating mutation, lysine-to-alanine, in the ATP pocket of the PK2 catalytic domain. These mutants have normal sarcomere structure, normal force generation, even better than normal muscle function, and yet display fragmented mitochondria that have increased basal respiration that cannot be uncoupled further. We gained insight into molecules and processes that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, uncoupling, and higher ATP. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomere to mitochondria which may function to match energy needs to energy production, and that PK2 of UNC-89 (obscurin) is key to this communication.Results Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected to result in instability A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST confirmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinases). The DMT class takes its name from their representative Death-associated-protein kinases (DAPKs), Myosin light-chain-kinases (MLCKs), and Triple functional domain protein-related kinases (TRIO) and contains, in addition, various muscle kinases including human titin kinase, nematode twitchin kinase (TwcK) and mammalian obscurin and SPEG kinases32. The BLAST search revealed that PK2 shares the highest sequence identity levels with DAPKs, TwcK, and MLCK (Supplementary Fig. 1). DAPK, TwcK, and MLCK kinases are proven to be catalytically active and their phosphotransfer has been characterized33–35. Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Specifically, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involved in ATP-binding, an AAK motif in β-strand β3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms a salt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committed state of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residue chelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartate and a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordination), both in the catalytic loop motif36,37. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK1138, TP53RK39, and mouse obscurin PK228 contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively. Fig. 1.

Bottom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs. unc-89(sf22). The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are ~800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspecific reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies46.During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC-89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness36. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement31,32. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable, we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldX v441. This yielded a calculated comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, of −0.15 kcal/mol and indicated that no significant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. To summarize, UNC-89-PK2 is modeled by Alphafold in a catalytically-primed conformational state compatible with kinase activity, the active site comprises the essential functional groups necessary for phosphor-transfer and the introduced mutation is not expected to cause structural instability. Taken together, bioinformatics analysis indicates that UNC-89-PK2 is a canonical, active kinase and that the observed nematode phenotype in this work results from hindered phosphor-transfer by PK2 resulting from the inactivating KtoA mutation.Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move faster than wild-type nematodes We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm (Fig. 1d), unc-89(sf22), in which PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-target mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody10. Surprisingly, unlike all other unc-89 mutants, unc-89(sf22) worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostaining using antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for the base of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, and F-actin for I-bands (Fig. 2a–c). Detection and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, the normal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major loss of the mutant UNC-89 protein. To examine the myofilament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As shown in Fig. 2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres in unc-89(sf22) and in unc-89(syb1360), a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin filaments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Fig. 2. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure. Open in a new tab a The drawing on the right shows a cross-section through an adult worm indicating that the body wall muscle is organized into four quadrants. Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells (23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myofilament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick filaments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin filaments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs).

Bottom row displays the enlargement of one portion of the image above it. Yellow arrows, M-lines; yellow arrowheads, dense bodies, green arrows, SR. There is no discernible difference between the wild type and the two mutants in terms of numbers and organization of thick and thin filaments, M-lines, dense bodies, and SR. Scale bars, 0.5 μm.Because deficiency of mouse obscurin23 and worm UNC-8924 result in disorganized SR, we examined SR organization using the marker UNC-68 (Ryanodine receptor). However, HA-tagged UNC-68 endogenously expressed from a CRISPR/Cas9 strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a), or myc-tagged UNC-68 overexpressed from a transgene (Supplementary Fig. 4b) show normal localization in unc-89(sf22). Obscurin is also required for normal microtubule organization42. However, we found no difference in microtubule organization comparing wild type vs. unc-89(sf22), using a transgenic line expressing TBA-1 (α-tubulin) tagged with HA (Supplementary Fig. 5). unc-89 is also expressed in the single sarcomere muscle cells of the pharynx. UNC-89 is normally localized to the middle of the A-bands of pharyngeal sarcomeres8,10. All previously characterized unc-89 mutants, except for unc-89(tm752), have abnormally organized filaments as observed by polarized light or immunostaining6,9,11, with characteristic arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, both unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) display normal pharyngeal muscle as assessed by staining with anti-UNC-89 and the pharyngeal muscle-specific MHC C. Nearly all previously characterized unc-89 mutants have reduced whole animal locomotion and generate reduced maximal force9, most likely because sarcomere disorganization results in reduced muscle activity. The one known exception is unc-89(ad539), but this mutant only affects the organization of the pharyngeal muscle. Two independently derived UNC-89 KtoA mutants, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360), crawl faster than wild-type worms on an agar surface (Fig. 3a), and generate the same amount of maximal force43 as wild type (Fig. 3b).

This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others44. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105)45 have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms8,11(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig2624,46, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig3946, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria. Fig. 4. Body wall muscle cells of UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Open in a new tab a Confocal images of body wall muscle stained with antibodies to ATP5A to reveal the morphology of mitochondria. Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as “tubular”. In contrast, unc-89(sf22) which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, and unc-89(tm752) which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear as dots or can be described as fragmented. By comparison, unc-89(e1460) which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, and unc-89(su75) which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear more tubular or more like wild type. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicated strains. Note the presence of linear or tubular mitochondria in wild type and unc-89(e1460) and fragmented mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752). c, d Three additional independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutants (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) show fragmented mitochondria. Scale bars, 10 μm in (a and c); 5 μm in (b and d).Because CRISPR/Cas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles (sf24, syb1195, and syb1360) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change. sf22 and sf24 are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, and syb1195 and syb1360 are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type. The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation as unc-89(sf22) worms (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology.In PK2 KtoA mutants, mitochondrial fragmentation results from greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria In C. elegans, mitochondrial fusion and fission are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44 (Fig. 5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); fission is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited to mitochondria where it forms a large spiral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously47(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. Fig. 5. drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). Open in a new tab a Mitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion and fission, through the actions of several conserved GTPases of the dynamin family. The names of the nematode proteins are indicated with their mammalian orthologs shown in parentheses. b 3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria stained with anti-ATP5A. The drp-1 null mutant shows abnormally clumped mitochondria, whereas unc-89(sf22) shows fragmented (smaller) mitochondria. The double mutant, unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) shows the Drp-1 single mutant phenotype. Scale bar, 5 μm.In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, fission is promoted48. We tested the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by which unc-89 KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmentation is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c). Therefore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at least partially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are more fragmented. Fig. 6. More DRP-1 is associated with UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutant mitochondria as compared to wild-type mitochondria.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Because mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased respiration and ATP production49,50, we compared levels of ATP in wild type vs. each of the 4 PK2 KtoA mutant alleles. Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to find that each mutant shows at least a 40% increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status51. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells52,53. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm)54. The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels55. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions. Fig. 7. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated ATP levels.

For each strain, n = 3, and *: p < 0.05 by Dunnett’s test.Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled in unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondrial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type in C. elegans56 to isolate mitochondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from the myo-3 promoter, total mitochondria were purified, and then mostly muscle-specific mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in muscle mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-based respiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex I induced respiration (addition of substrates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria from unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) showed significantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupled by adding FCCP (Fig. 8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respiration (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncoupled (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8. PK2 KtoA mutants display altered mitochondrial respiration and altered levels of some electron transport chain complexes. Open in a new tab a, b Muscle mitochondria from PK2 KtoA mutants have increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration and each cannot be uncoupled. a Complex I (glutamate and malate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 3–8 per strain). b Complex II (succinate) stimulated basal and uncoupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates measured in isolated muscle mitochondria from wild type (wt), unc-89(sf22), and unc-89 (syb1360) mutant strains (n = 4–5 per strain). Means and standard errors of the mean are represented. Significance was tested by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.005, ***p ≤ 0.0005, ****p ≤ 0.00005. c, d PK2 KtoA mutants have altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. c Representative western blots reacted against antibodies to the indicated components of complexes I, II, IV, V, and cytochrome C. d Quantitation of these results with n = 3. au: arbitrary units. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction. Note that as compared to wild type, complexes I and V are normal, but complexes II and IV are reduced, and cytochrome C is elevated in the PK2 KtoA mutants.To gain insight into why complex I respiration is increased and complex II respiration is decreased, we assessed the protein levels of one component of each electron chain complex by western blots. Unfortunately, we could not identify a commercially available antibody that reacted against a complex III component, so complex III was not assessed. As shown in Fig. 8c, d, the levels of complexes I and V are normal, complexes II and IV are decreased, and cytochrome C (which shunts electrons from III to IV) is increased. These results only partially explain why complex II-based respiration is decreased.Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partially explain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we explored the additional possibility that glycolysis was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycolysis when mitochondria do not perform well57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is significantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig. 9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Fig. 9. PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. Open in a new tab Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig. 8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs)58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles59. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig. 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study. Fig. 10. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated levels of UCP-4 protein but not mRNA. Open in a new tab a Representative western blot reacted with anti-HA to detect UCP-4-HA.

Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction.Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria Since the presumed inactivation of PK2 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation we wondered what would happen if the activity of PK2 was increased. We tested this by overexpressing a portion of UNC-89 containing wild-type PK2. We reported that a segment consisting of the C-terminal third of the interkinase region followed by Ig53, Fn2, and PK2 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-Pk2), when transgenically expressed from a heat shock promoter localizes to the M-line, the normal location of UNC-8946. This strain and wild type, as day 1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30° for 2 h, and then immunostained using anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, although mitochondria from the wild type showed the expected linear/tubular organization, mitochondria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clumping. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1, but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria.Discussion We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are fragmented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission60. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it48. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity. That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into the mitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins, C. elegans expresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoA mutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2 KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2. Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria61. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the first to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al.63 demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. Increased mitochondrial fragmentation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function49,64. However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission65. Feng et al.66 reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle67. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.Materials and methods Bioinformatics analysis of PK2 Three-dimensional structural models of UNC-89-PK2 (UniProtKB O01761) were calculated using AlphaFold v2.3.168 as implemented in the ColabFold 1.5.5 server (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). In order to estimate the effect of the KtoA mutation (K7816A in UniProtKB O01761) on kinase stability, we calculated a comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, between wild type and in silico mutated PK2 models, where ΔΔG = ΔGKtoA – ΔGwt. To calculate the ΔΔG value, the best-ranking AlphaFold model was used as template in FoldX v441, applying the RepairPDB function for gentle model equilibration, followed by the introduction of the KtoA mutation using the PositionScan function, as described in ref. 69.

Details about the sgRNAs and repair templates used are given in Supplementary Fig. 11.Western blots The method of Hannak et al.70 was used to prepare total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22), unc-89(syb1360), drp-1(tm1108), PHX6586 ucp-4(syb6586), GB367 unc-89(sf22); ucp-4(syb6586), GB368 unc-89(syb1360); ucp-4(syb6586), and GB267 sfIs13[hsp::HA::UNC-89 (1/3 IK-Ig-Fn-PK2; sur-5::GFP)] worms. To detect UNC-89 proteins, we separated the protein lysate on a 3% stacking and 5% separating Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h, and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:400 dilution10, followed by reaction with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. Western blots to detect DRP-1 were used in three types of experiments. First, to check the specificity of anti-DRP-1 antibodies, equal quantities of total protein lysates from wild type and drp-1(tm1108) were separated on a 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted against affinity-purified anti-DRP-1 at 1:200 dilution which had been pre-absorbed against an acetone powder of E. coli OP50 to reduce or eliminate reaction to bacterial proteins. Second, we used a similar approach to compare the levels of DRP-1 in total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Third, we compared the level of DRP-1 from total worm mitochondria from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Preparation of total worm mitochondria by differential centrifugation was conducted as described below in the section on purifying muscle mitochondria. We also performed western blots to compare the levels of representative components of electron chain complexes from total protein lysates. Antibodies and concentrations were: complex I, mouse monoclonal to NDUFS3 (Abcam cat. no. ab14711) at 1:2,500 dilution; complex II, rabbit anti-SDHA (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 11998 P) at 1:500 dilution; complex IV, mouse monoclonal to MTCO1 (Abcam cat. no. ab14705) at 1:2000 dilution; complex V, mouse monoclonal to ATP5A (Abcam cat. no. ab147481) at 1:5000 dilution; and mouse monoclonal to cytochrome C (Abcam cat. no. ab110325) at 1:1000 dilution. Finally, we performed western blots to measure the level of UCP-4-HA in wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) backgrounds using anti-HA (rabbit monoclonal cat. no. C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000 dilution. Before use, the optimal dilutions of each antibody were determined to yield linear detection of the proteins. Protein bands were quantitated by comparing to scans of Ponceau S staining of a gel lane on the blot. The uncropped and unedited blot images used to prepare Figs. 1d, 6a–c, 8c, 10a, and Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, are shown respectively in Supplementary Figs. 12–16.Immunostaining and confocal microscopy of body wall muscle myofilament lattice and mitochondria, and pharyngeal myofilament lattice Day 0 or day 1 adult worms were fixed and immunostained using the method described by Nonet et al.71. The following antibodies were used to stain parts of the myofilament lattice, all at 1:200 dilution: anti-UNC-95 (rabbit polyclonal Benian-13)72, anti-MHC A (mouse monoclonal 5–6)73, and anti-UNC-89(rabbit polyclonal EU30)10. Fixation and phalloidin-rhodamine staining were conducted as described in ref. 74. To visualize mitochondria, we used mouse monoclonal antibody (15H4C4) also at 1:200 dilution (Abcam cat. no. ab14748). For pharyngeal muscle imaging, the fixed adult day 1 worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (EU30) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.175) at 1:100. Secondary antibodies, used at 1:200 dilution, included anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and anti-mouse Alexa 594, all purchased from Invitrogen. Confocal images were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100 M microscope and an Apochromat x63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, in 1× and 2.5× zoom mode. For the confocal images, the color balances were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Super-resolution microscopy was performed using a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 561-nm solid-state laser, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). Super-resolution images were reconstructed using the N-SIM module in NIS-Elements software. The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series every 0.2 μm was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell. This Z stack was then reconstructed into a 3D image using software on the N-SIM microscope. The reconstructed 3D z-stacks were analyzed using Imaris 8.6 (Bitplane), to visualize the mitochondria. Measurement of mitochondrial length in μm from the 3D reconstructions of SIM images was performed using Imaris software on a combination of 2 images from each wild type and mutant strain. The longest axis of each anti-ATP5A-staining object (mitochondrion) was determined using the Imaris parameter called “BoundingBoxOOLength”. After eliminating objects <1 μm, the number of objects was placed and counted in 3 bins: 1 ≤ × < 5 μm, 5 ≤ × < 10 μm, and x ≥ 10 μm. The Y axis of the graph in Supplementary Fig. 8 represents the number of objects in each bin divided by the total number objects.Electron microscopy Electron microscopy of body wall muscle was performed as described in Matsunaga et al.45. From each strain, approximately 200 days 2 adults were fixed and processed, and approximately 10 randomly selected ultrathin sections were examined. Approximately 30 low-powered images were captured that revealed all of the sarcomeres of single body wall muscle cells, and from these 10–20 images at higher magnification were captured that revealed 1–2 sarcomeres each. All these images were examined by two individuals both on a computer screen and by printouts, looking for any differences between the wild type and the two mutant alleles, sf22 and syb1360. Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d.Crawling assays and NemaFlex force measurement For crawling assays, day two adults were harvested from one 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plate with M9 buffer, and a final wash in M9 containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. Five microliters of worm suspension were added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate and then the excess liquid was removed using a twisted KimWipe. After a five-minute adaptation time, worm crawling movement was recorded using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope fitted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). For all strains a total of fifteen, 10-s. videos were recorded from various sections of the plate with each video tracking an average of 8 individual animals. Video data was analyzed by Image J WrmTracker software plug-in to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) for individual animals. Worms that moved out of frame and outliers were removed during data analysis and an average of 20 animals were analyzed for each strain. The resulting BBPS values for each mutant strain were compared to the wild type and further tested for statistically significant differences using Welch’s T-test. The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was measured using the NemaFlex method43. The technique is based on the deflection of soft micropillars as the animals crawl through an array of micropillars. The pillars are arranged in a square lattice with a pillar diameter of 44 μm and height of 87 μm. The gap between the pillars is 71 μm. Day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber76, and a 1-min video was captured for each animal in a food-free environment at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C. Imaging was performed in brightfield using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and an Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Images were acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4× objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 μm per pixel. Movies were processed and analyzed for force values using in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Animal muscle strength measurements were calculated by identifying the maximal force exerted in each frame for an individual animal. We define the maximum exertable force f95 corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Generation of antibodies to DRP-1 Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to the C-terminal 143 residues of DRP-1b, amino acids 570-712. The coding sequence of this segment was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool (RB2 library) and cloned into vectors pGEX-KK1 and pMAL-KK, to express glutathione S-transferase (GST) and MBP fusion proteins in E. coli77. In brief, to express each fusion protein, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Millipore Corporation, cat. no. 71397-4), and grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 10 µg/ml ampicillin at 37° to OD600 = 0.6–0.8, followed by induction of expression with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20° for 5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Inc., cat. no. 11836170001), and broken in a French pressure cell at 1000 pounds inch−2, the addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, followed by spinning out debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The lysates were added to either a slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, cat. no. G-4510) or amylose resin (New England BioLabs, cat. no. E8021L) and incubated with mixing for 30 min at 4°. The beads were washed 5X with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 100 mM PMSF, and then 4× with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM PMSF. The beads were placed into minicolumns and eluted with either 10 mM free glutathione or 10 mM maltose in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The GST fusions were shipped to Noble Life Sciences (Sykesville, Maryland) for the production of rabbit antibodies. Antibodies were affinity-purified using Affi-gel (Bio-Rad)-conjugated MBP fusions, as described78. Briefly, the MBP fusion proteins were dialyzed against 100 mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.0, and then 3–10 mg were covalently coupled to 1 ml of a 50:50 mixture of Affi-Gel 10 and Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, cat. nos. 1536099 and 153-6051). These columns were then used to affinity purify ~2 ml of antiserum and the antibodies eluted with low and high pH and concentrated with a centrifugal filter (Centriprep 10, Millipore, cat. no. 4304).Measurement of ATP levels in whole worms 100 day 1 adults were collected and washed free from bacteria, pelleted in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. After placing on ice for 5 min and vortexing for 5 s, debris was pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microfuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and diluted 5–10 fold with deionized water and kept on ice. Using this material, the total protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, cat. no. 23225), and the total ATP determined using a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit from Promega Corporation. Results were expressed as nmoles of ATP per milligram of protein.Use of PercevalHR to measure ATP/ADP ratio The plasmid pRsetB-PercevalHR was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA), and The XbaI/XhoI fragment of pRsetB-PercevalHR was inserted into the vector pPD95.86 via its XbaI/SalI sites to allow expression of PercevalHR from the muscle-specific promoter for the myo-3 gene. The resulting plasmid, myo-3p::PercevalHR at 10 ng/ml, was co-injected into worms together with the transformation marker plasmid lin-44p::GFP at 90 ng/ml, into wild-type worms, and transgenic animals were selected on the basis of GFP expression in the worm tail. The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation79 with modifications (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296, sfIs21[myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP]. sfIs21 was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and into drp-1(tm1108), to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a major conformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound. Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a fluorescent read-out of this conformation. An ATP to ADP ratio is proportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults were immobilized for imaging without drugs using a combination of a PDMS microfluidic device with channels just large enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F12780. The microfluidic devices were kindly manufactured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Aqueous solutions of Pluronic F127 are fluid at 4°, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created by dividing the emissions, Em 488/Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images, the total number of pixels with intensity greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations were calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain.Purification of muscle mitochondria and respirometry Body wall muscle-specific mitochondria were purified from strains expressing tomm20-mKate2-HA from the promoter of the muscle-specific gene myo-3, using a modified version of the procedure developed by Ahier et al.56. Briefly, for each strain, we harvested a mixed-stage population of nematodes from 2, 15 cm, high peptone plates seeded with E. coli strain NA22. Worms were washed free from bacteria by at least 3 washes of M9 buffer, followed by 2 washes with deionized water. The worm pellets were resuspended in 3.5 mls of ice-cold Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer (MIB; 50 mM KCl, 110 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris pH 7.4 without protease inhibitors) and transferred to a 7 ml Dounce homogenizer. While on ice, we brought the pestle up and down 25 times. The homogenate was transferred to 3, 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun in a microfuge at 4° for 5 min at 200 × g. The resulting supernatant was transferred to 3 fresh tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. This supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The pellets from all 3 Eppendorf tubes were resuspended in a final volume of 600 μl of ice-cold PEB (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, without protease inhibitors). To this suspension was added 30 μl of a suspension of anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, cat. no. 88836), and the tube placed on a rotating wheel at 4° for one hour. The beads were then pulled out of the solution using a tube stand containing neodymium magnets (Millipore Corporation), and then the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PEB, and then resuspended in 50–100 μl of MIB and kept on ice. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using a Clark electrode (Oxytherm System, Hansatech) as described81. Briefly, isolated muscle mitochondria were suspended in respiration buffer containing 120 mM KCl, 3 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM KH2PO4, and 0.3% (w/v) fat-free BSA. Complex I substrates (10 mM glutamate, and 2 mM malate) or complex II substrates (7 mM succinate) were added in addition to 1.2 mM ADP to stimulate basal respiration. Uncoupled respiration was measured with the addition of 80 nM FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was assessed with the addition of potassium cyanide (500 μM). To assess mitochondrial respiration, the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was subtracted from the total oxygen consumption rate.Glycolysis assay We used Abcam’s “6-Phosphofructokinase Activity Assay Kit (colorimetric)” (ab155898) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 50 milligrams of packed worms were homogenized in 200 μl of PFK Assay Buffer, using a Pellet Pestle Motor (DWK Life Sciences Kimble Kontes). After determining the protein concentrations using a Bradford assay, approximately 1 μg of total protein extract was used per assay. PFK activity was recorded as mU/mg protein.Statistics and reproducibility GraphPad Prism9 was used to plot and analyze numerical data. Figure legends explain the n values, whether standard deviations or standard errors of the mean were plotted, which statistical tests were used, and the definition of * values. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction unless otherwise specified. Each experiment was conducted several times independently and only if the same results or tendencies were obtained, were figures and conclusions made. Many experiments involved imaging and evaluation of the images was conducted by at least two individuals but in most cases, no quantitation was involved, so statistical analysis was not used.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Peer Review File (3.5MB, pdf) Supplementary Information (32.9MB, pdf) 42003_2024_7042_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (87.3KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary File Supplementary Data (67.3KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements These studies were primarily supported by grant no. 2050009 from the National Science Foundation to G.M.B and J.Q.K.

    "title": "Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11451251/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

    "introduction": "Introduction The environment of outer space, characterized by intense radiation and high vacuum, presents harsh conditions for any form of life. Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Deinococcus species) [1, 2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6, 7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13]. The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, dried Deinococcus cell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover, D. radiodurans after being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival of D. radiodurans exposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis of B. pumilus SAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores of B. pumilus SAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10, 15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes. Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10, 12, 18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17, 20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species, Bacillus safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24]. This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig. 1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained. Fig. 1.

    "methods": "Methods Bacteria isolation, genome assembly and annotation Sample collection and bacterial isolation from ISS were performed as previously described [23, 62]. Biochemical tests were performed using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) and phenotypic fingerprint was generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog’s protocol as described elsewhere [28]. We assembled the genomes of five novel bacterial species isolated from various surfaces of the ISS (specifically strains IF8SW-P5, IIF3SC_B10, F6_8S_P_1B, F6_8S_P_2B, F6_3S_P_1C), using the SPAdes workflow [63]. Phylogenetic affiliations are as outlined in [28] and presented in Table 1. DNA extraction The ISS isolates (n = 5) were grown on R2A medium and incubated at 30 °C, for 2 to 7 days. For WGS, DNA was isolated with the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit, and WGS libraries prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex kit. Sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 platform involved paired-end, 2 × 150 bp reads. FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and fastp [64] ensured data quality. WGS reads were assembled using SPAdes [63], with genome statistics from QUAST [65] and quality checks from CheckM [66]. Species verification through fastANI [67] and fastAAI (https://github.com/cruizperez/FastAAI) confirmed identities with over 95% identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was estimated with GGDC using Formula 2 [68]. For genome synteny analysis, we used SynTracker [25]. Genome annotation Following assembly, the contigs were subjected to the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) [69], available at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki, in order to obtain draft genomes and proteomes. Genomes were further investigated for their functions, where all identified genes (bearing PGAP descriptions in their names) underwent homology-based annotation using eggNOG v5.0, accessible at https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper. Genomes of closest relatives of the ISS species (highest ANI) were also subjected to PGAP and eggNOG annotation. Proteomes with the PGAP identifiers were used as input for DeepFRI analysis [58], available on github: (https://github.com/bioinf-mcb/Metagenomic-DeepFRI/), which generated query contact map using results from mmseqs2 target database [70] search for similar protein sequences with known structures and with v 1.0 model weights. For reference database, we combined structures from Swissprot (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download), microbiome immunity project (MIP) [71] and protein databank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org). Next, the contact map alignment was performed to use it as input to DeepFRI’s Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and annotations without the alignment to known structures were processed with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For MQ and HQ annotation, scores higher than or equal to 0.3 (50% of prediction confidence; MQ) and 0.5 (90% of prediction confidence; HQ) were used respectively (Figs. 2-3). All annotations for ISS strains and their terrestrial relatives are provided in Supplementary Tables S2–S11. Phylogenetically close relatives from Earth for each tested species were identified using ANI (Table 1). Their genomes were annotated using DeepFRI as described above. Protein sequences from the aforementioned five species were aligned and conducted two-dimensional clustering using CD-HIT [72], available at https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit, employing a 40% similarity threshold. Genes below that threshold were considered “novel” and subjected to analysis shown in Fig. 3A–B. Annotations (GO terms) were then compared between ISS strains (Supplementary Table S12) and their terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S13). Common annotations were aggregated according to clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories [73] using go2cog mapper (https://github.com/Tomasz-Lab/go2cog). GO terms that could be assigned to more than 3 COG categories were grouped as category R—“general function prediction” (Figs. 2 and 3). Heatmaps were generated using seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). Venn diagrams and Upsetplot were generated using matplotlib (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Using a knowledge-based approach, a set of genes was selected for further analysis. Protein structures were modeled using in silico structure prediction tool—AlphaFold Colab [27]—and hence obtained protein databank (PDB) format structures were aligned using Geneious Prime 2023.1.1 (Biomatters). Structures were aligned using TM-align tool [26]. Based on the predicted structure, novel functional annotation was performed using DeepFRI. All the annotation data and scripts are placed in the repository on github (https://github.com/lmszydlowski/Adaptation-of-novel-bacterial-species-isolated-from-the-International-Space-Station). Sequence alignments, functional annotations for plasmids, phage elements and biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome Sequences of selected proteins were aligned using Muscle 5.1 [74]. Clustering dendrograms were built using PhyML 3.3, [75] using LG amino acid substitution model and approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) for branch support. All contigs generated for each genome were scanned for potential plasmids using PLASme software (https://github.com/HubertTang/PLASMe), phage-related elements using PHASTER software [76, 77] and results provided in the Supplementary Tables S15–S16. Genome sequences were also processed through the AntiSMASH 7.0 software [60] to look for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Supplementary Table S14). Protein mutation and enrichment analysis To investigate the roles and processes of proteins highly enriched in bacteria from the ISS, we specifically focused on the enrichment of certain amino acids, especially proline and glycine, which belong to unique amino acid change groups. The amino acid compositions of proteins from the ISS strains were compared with those proteins found in the closest terrestrial species through global alignment methods [78]. This facilitates the identification and quantification of any shifts in the amino acid composition. These shifts were evaluated by calculating the mutation rate, which is achieved by dividing the number of amino acid substitutions in the ISS bacteria by the number of amino acid substitutions in their closest terrestrial relatives. Proteins with normalized amino acid mutation rate and Z-score above 1.96 or below − 1.96 were classified as enriched. To investigate the functions and pathways of these proteins, we utilize the g:Profiler enrichment tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost [79]). Custom gene sets for bacteria were created using UniProt’s [80] predicted GO term associations [81] for bacterial proteins. The tool was configured to include a minimum gene set size of 5 and a maximum of 10,000, focusing on molecular function GO terms. Shared gene sets between samples were filtered using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 in 1424 molecular function GO terms. Data visualization was enhanced through ete3 (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw046) for constructing phylogenetic trees and seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) for generating heatmaps. The phylogenetic distance between bacterial species was calculated using ’s distance calculations, with the closest terrestrial bacteria as a reference.",
    "results": "Results Comparison of different annotations and between the isolates and within pangenome context Five novel species of Gram-positive bacteria that were isolated from the ISS were analyzed. Their generic features and the results of other molecular analyses are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. These bacteria were obtained from various flights, locations, and time periods, and are associated with different phylogenetic groups. The strain F6_3S_P_1C, which belongs to the Paenibacillus genus, has been identified as a spore-former, while the other four species were identified as non-spore-forming Actinobacteria. Through ANI and AAI analysis, we established closest Earth relatives (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, we performed synteny analysis [25] using all top ANI hits for each of the five organisms (Supplementary Table S1), but yielded no results (data not shown), thus indicating all ISS isolates are distinct species.

In total, the genomes of the novel species encompassed 1290 and 1184 shared MQ and HQ annotations (1778 all annotations, Fig. 2a, b). The majority of shared annotations were related to metabolism, followed by cellular processing and signaling and information storage and processing (Fig. 2c; all common annotations (GO terms) are detailed in Supplementary Table S12 in the Supplementary material). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Overview of the annotations common in all ISS species.

B Upset plot showing common annotations (derived from DeepFRI) with different groups of interests. C Clustering all isolates’ common annotations in the form of clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories. See the “Methods” for more detailsAnnotations unique to ISS bacterial species All curated  () genomes were used to find the closest terrestrial relatives for the novel ISS bacterial species and the genome that exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity (ANI) value was further compared with genomes of ISS strains to characterize unique annotation. When compared with their closest terrestrial relatives all ISS species have different numbers of unique annotations (Fig. 3a), which corresponds to their ANI (the higher the ANI, the fewer unique annotations). Additionally, two-dimensional Conserved Domain (CD)-hit clustering was performed between each isolate and its closest relative, using a 40% sequence similarity threshold. Thus, for each isolate a subgroup of unique genes (with no counterparts in their closest relative) was found (Supplementary Tables S2–S11). A comparison between these genes revealed the presence of 74 and 49 MQ and HQ common annotations, respectively (309 total annotations, Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table S13). Fig. 3.

Mma, Microbacterium mcarthurae (magenta); Mme, Microbacterium meiriae (orange); pLDDT, predicted local-distance difference test; pTM, predicted template modeling; TM, template modeling, see [26, 27]When aligning the novel genes in the genome context, we found the presence of potential novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all species. These BGCs encode secondary metabolites such as terpenes, carotenes, betalactones, lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, non-ribosomal metallophores, furans, non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA), type 3 polyketide synthase (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), proteusins (Supplementary Fig. S1), Our findings of BGCs are complimentary to the previously reported BGCs in A. burdickii, L. williamsii, and P. vandeheii [28]. We also expand the BGCs classification of the studied ISS species into the “novel” category, which are not found in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives. In this study, we report small molecule biosynthetic pathways, metal ion transporters and other transmembrane transporters. Furthermore, transcription factors associated with environmental stress have been found (Supplementary Table S14). Given the difference in ANI for each ISS-species:closest-relative pair, a different number of novel gens was obtained in each case, proportional to the phylogenetic distance (the lower the ANI, the more novel genes were found). We therefore focused on the two Microbacteria species, as their ANI to the closest relative was higher than 98%. Using Muscle, we aligned sequences of novel genes from each species together. We found an example of novel genes (Mma_002827 and Mme_000934) being present in both species with high (52.8%) sequence similarity. Given that initial annotation (“heavy metal associated domain,” “response to copper ion,” see Supplementary Tables S2 and S6), was sequence-based (see the “Methods\" for details), another approach was assayed, with structure prediction, followed by a functional annotation. Superpositions of predicted structures (both with pTM > 0.7 and pLDDT > 80) are almost identical (Fig. 3c). The structure-based deepFRI annotations reveal that these proteins have oxidoreductase activity (acting on CH-NH2 group of donors) and that are located in the extracellular layer of the cell (Supplementary Table S15). When compared to the proteome of D. radiodurans, weak structural homology was found to extracellular protein WP_027479552.1 (TM-score 0.34, see Supplementary Fig. S2). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposases were also found in all species except L. williamsii. There is also evidence of plasmid in some of the species (M. mcarthurae, M. meiriae), due to the presence of relaxosome encoding genes, such as MobC/L family relaxase (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S16). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Heatmap representing abundance of annotations of interest in the studied species Comparison of proteome-level mutations in the ISS species and within pangenome context Several groups of proteins, important for adaptation to space environmental conditions were analyzed between ISS species and their closest Earth relatives. In metallopeptidases, the mutation rate of hydrophobic amino acids and glycine are higher than 1 in this protein group, suggesting an enrichment of these amino acids in the metallopeptidase proteins of ISS bacteria. These mutations might enhance the stability of these proteins under space environmental conditions (Fig. 4A). Glycine enrichment is a measure of how often the amino acid glycine appears in a protein sequence compared to what would be expected by chance (see the “Methods\" for more details). Significant glycine enrichment in a protein can suggest evolutionary pressures and adaptive responses to make proteins more flexible via mutation to glycine [29]. The metallopeptidase activity stands out as it exhibits consistent glycine enrichment across all strains, suggesting it may play a critical role in universal adaptive mechanisms (Fig. 4B). Other molecular functions, such as “ATP-dependent peptidase activity” and “2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity,” show high glycine enrichment, but only in both Microbaterium species, indicating potential taxonomy-based adaptations (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of mutation enrichment in ISS species across different protein families. A Clustering dendrogram representing enrichment in protein mutations (wrt closest relative) related to the protein group and type of mutation. B Mutation enrichment of selected proteins (wrt Uniprot database) with their significance scoresCertain molecular functions, such as “5 formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo ligase activity,” “ATP dependent peptidase activity,” and “ATP phosphoribosyltransferase activity,” display a high degree of hydrophobic amino acid enrichment, but only in M. meiriae and L. williamsii. This could suggest convergent adaptations involving changes in hydrophobicity of aforementioned proteins. Interestingly, “metallopeptidase activity” shows hydrophobic amino acid enrichment across all ISS species, albeit at a lower level than glycine enrichment. This could suggest a universal, but less dominant, adaptive strategy involving changes in protein hydrophobicity. These patterns underscore the complexity of potential adaptive strategies, highlighting the interplay between different types of amino acid changes in response to ISS environments (Fig. 4B). Metallopeptidases play role in celluar stress response [15], biofilm formation [30], as well as virulence [31] and hence are important factors in microbial adaptations to space conditions. Therefore, comparative analysis of sequences and structures of selected metallopeptidases from M. meiriae and its closest relative will be further discussed in the section below. Case studies of adaptations The functional annotations were further investigated to search for genes that would allow adaptation to life in space. The genes of interest were summarized in Fig. 5. Energy metabolism As previously reported [8–10, 12, 13, 18] metabolic rearrangements are essential part of adaptations to life in space (see overview in Fig. 1). Common annotations show the presence of genes encoding proteins related to carbohydrate, cofactors and coenzymes metabolism (Figs. 2c and 3b). Apart from genomic annotation (Supplementary Table S12), metabolic tests conducted on the ISS bacterial species reveal their ability to grow on a broad range of carbon sources, including cyclic compounds, oligo- and polysaccharides (Supplementary Fig. S3a–b). All species are capable of growing on 27 substrates being the sole carbon source, including carbohydrates (pectin, dextrin, mannose, fucose, gentibiose, lactose, melibiose, glucose, galactose, fructose as well as their branched and glycosylated derivatives), fatty acids (acetic acid, L-malic acid, sodium lactate and butyrate), amino acids (L-glutamic acid), alcohols (glycerol) and antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam). They can also grow at 1% NaCl concentration and pH6. Apart from the spore-forming P. vandeheii, the other bacteria can also utilize tween 40, gelatin, D-malic acid, L-lactic acid, propionic acid, D/L-serine, L-alanine, sorbitol, lincomycin, minocycline, nalidixic acid, rifamycin, as well as grow in the presence of lithium chloride. On the other hand, only P. vandeheii is able to grow in the presence of sodium bromate. Additionally to the species described by Simpson and colleagues [28], two species of Microbacterium were characterized for the first time. These species are able to utilize 72 carbon sources altogether (80 and 73 substrates for M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, respectively), grow at 8% NaCl concentration, as well as in the presence of lithium chloride and potassium tellurite. Unlike other species, either M. mcarthurae or M. meiriae can utilize α-keto-glutaric acid and citric acid.Mechanosensitive ion channels (Msc) and osmoprotectants Except for A. burdickii, each of the studied organisms has at least one copy of mscS gene annotated. Msc proteins are known to play a crucial role in adapting cells to the osmotic pressure [32]. Overall, two variants of Msc proteins exist: large conductance (3.6 nS) MscL and small conductance (1 nS) MscS. Large conductance channels are generally conserved and present in most bacteria as well as eukaryotes, although they are not found in deep sea species, where no pressure changes occur. Conversely, MscS are diverse structurally and functionally and occur in those organisms, which exhibit hypo-osmotic stress periodically (e.g., desiccation). MscS proteins have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and conductive properties. Because low gravity conditions can be viewed as decrease in osmotic pressure, leading to the hypo-osmotic stress, their presence is therefore crucial for survival in ISS. All terrestrial relatives have a copy of mscS gene with over 90% sequence similarity to their homologous gene from the ISS species (Supplementary Fig. S4), except for L. williamsii, where there is an additional copy of the mscS with no homology in the genome of Leifsonia sp. ku-ls. Nevertheless, the presence of an additional copy of mscS gene could be due to the larger phylogenetic distance, as indicated by ANI (Fig. 3A). As for the osmoprotectants, there is no commonly shared metabolite, as genes related to betaine, choline, ectoine and trehalose synthesis are not present in all five species.Redox stress Changes in osmotic pressure, as well as exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have detrimental effects on cells. From the studies on Deinococcus it was found that it has elevated intracellular concentrations of Mn as well as Fe [33]. All studied ISS strains show an elevated number of metalloproteins compared to their closest terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S12). In the case of M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, there are 27 and 25 unique metalloproteins, respectively (Supplementary Table S14), which include metallopeptidases, thioredoxins, metalloregulated transcription factors and heavy metal associated P-type ATPases. Metallopeptidases were of our special interest, as they showed certain adaptive mutations in all studied species (as described in previous section). Therefore, we decided to further analyze the metallopeptidase pair from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1. We found aminopeptidases in two of these species (Mme_001931 and WP_268776344.1 from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1, respectively), which share only 44% protein sequence similarity (58.4% nucleotide similarity, Supplementary Fig. S5). When structural models were calculated for these proteins (both with pTM-score ≫ 0.9), their superposition is almost identical (Fig. 6A), despite the low sequence similarity. When analyzing enrichment of the amino acids in Mme_001931 with WP_268776344.1 as a baseline, we observed enrichment of arginine and methionine, which were over 1.5 times more abundant compared to terrestrial protein. Opposite case was observed for lysine, which was over 2 times less abundant in ISS organism (Fig. 6B). When superimposed to deinococcal aminopeptidase (WP_0516188611), Mme_001931 exhibited similarly high TM-score (0.83), although the latter’s size is 1.81 times bigger than WP_0516188611 (Supplementary Fig. S6). In terms of amino acid enrichment, WP_051618861 also showed an elevated amount of arginines (8.3% wrt 5.5%) with subsequent decrease of lysines (1.1% wrt 2.6%) and increase in methionine with decrease of negatively charged amino acids, but also increase in glycines, histidines and prolines. Nonetheless, there is almost two times the size difference and further phylogenetic distance than in the case of M. meiriae (Supplementary Figure S6). Fig. 6.

Deinococcus radiodurans was extensively tested for its ability to protect and repair damaged DNA, which was due to its homologous recombination (HR) kit. All ISS species encode 10–14 genes related to HR, compared to 10 genes identified in D. radiodurans (Fig. 5). Similarly, all of the genomes share the set of rec, ruv, rad and uvr genes. In terms of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), all ISS strains share at least one gene. When compared with the Rec protein family from D. radiodurans and B. pumilus (Supplementary Fig. S7), clusters reflect phylogenetic distances. Moreover, all ISS strains share the LexA repressor (EC 3.4.21.88), which is part of the SOS response.Phage elements Phage elements were found in all genomes of ISS strains, with at least two phage-related genes found in each strain. Holin is a short protein containing few transmembrane regions. Although holin is usually accompanied by endolysin, there is no evidence of phage-related endolysin in any of the genome of ISS strains, suggesting that the phage elements could have been domesticated or removed. When tested with PHASTER software, prophage elements were detected only in the genome of P. vandeheii, as well as in its closest Earth relative (Supplementary Table S16).Potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance Common annotations (Supplementary Table S2) indicate the presence of genes with virulence potential, such as metallophores and hemolysins (including the group III family, which forms oligomeric complexes), which are present in all ISS strains. However, ISS strains often exhibit enhanced expression of these virulence genes due to the unique selective pressures of the space environment, such as microgravity and increased radiation. In contrast, Earth analogous strains show a greater diversity in these genes, driven by varied environmental challenges and human influences like antibiotic use and pollution ([34]. Genomes of all ISS bacterial species contain genes involved in biofilm formation, potentially posing a pathogenic risk to humans under specific conditions, even though these genera and their closest terrestrial relatives are not typically known to be infectious agents. Comparatively, Earth counterparts also form biofilms, but the selective pressures driving this ability differ. On Earth, biofilm formation is often a response to environmental challenges such as antibiotic exposure and surface colonization in diverse habitats. In contrast, ISS bacteria have shown adaptations favoring biofilm formation and surface interactions due to the unique conditions of the space environment, such as microgravity and limited nutrient availability [35]. Additionally, as Mora et al. highlighted in their work [36], the genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions, though not directly pertinent to human health, exhibit considerable adaptations for biofilm formation and surface interactions. Their research underscores the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent the formation of potentially harmful biofilms. Metabolic assays indicate that all ISS bacterial species have the ability to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds (Supplementary Fig. S3ab), showcasing their resilience in a controlled, high-stress environment. These bacteria also harbor various P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases within their pool of novel genes (Supplementary Table S12), suggesting advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance. Similarly, Earth analogs have evolved to degrade antimicrobial compounds, especially in environments heavily influenced by human activity, such as hospitals and agricultural sites [31].",
    "discussion": "Discussion The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment. Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen. The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance. A specific set of genes was discovered to be present in all isolates but absent in their closest terrestrial relatives. This observation is consistent with earlier findings on the ISS-specific evolutionary patterns [37, 38]. Mannose is a known substrate of glycosylation in prokaryotes [39] and thus may play a role in cell wall modifications, cell adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, genes related to beta-mannosidase and mannose activities were up-regulated in high salinity media in the brine shrimp Artemia salina [40], suggesting that mannose and its derivatives may be accumulated as organic osmolytes. Clusters associated with small molecule and peptide biosynthesis in fungi were found in abundance, reaffirming earlier studies into molecular responses to microgravity [11]. The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. This suggests they might have a defense mechanism against hypoosmotic shocks. Furthermore, novel surface oxidoreductases have been identified in M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae which are not present in their terrestrial analogs. In light of these findings, a deeper investigation using comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is recommended. To perform meta-omic analysis while cultivating these microorganisms on ISS would be very challenging. Nevertheless, such studies were conducted before, e.g., Tanpopo mission [15], although this study focused on meta-omic analyses post-exposure. Conducting in vivo experiments on microogranisms could be performed via simulating some of the conditions experienced in ISS, e.g., increased radiation, vacuum or microgravity. Ground facilities to recreate these conditions exist and has been utilized in such experiments before ([41–43], also reviewed in [10]). It would therefore be possible to compare gene expression profile under these conditions, protein activity (e.g., extracellular metallopeptidases) or even assay secretion of certain metabolites (e.g., chelators, antibiotics) on indicative media. Efficient DNA repair and its impact on survival in the extreme conditions has long been studied in many organisms [41, 44, 45]. LexA repressor-mediated response is known to be crucial to DNA protection and repair process [46]. Studies on extremophilic bdelloid rotifers highlighted the linkage of efficient DNA repair mechanisms with the presence of high rates of HGT [47, 48]. The detection of MGEs underscores a significant genetic factor hinting at the selective pressures faced by species isolated from the ISS. Interestingly, the quantity of annotated transposases seems to be in proportion to genome size, with P. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment. Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [49] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication. Hence, it is possible that in the species described in this study the TEs are significantly diverged. Extremophilic lifestyle provides selective pressure on maintaining genome integrity. Therefore, TEs disruptive activity is expected to be quenched, at least in the non-spore forming species. On the other hand, P. vandeheii may have a different adaptation system, being a spore-former (such as D. radiodurans, which is known to contain TEs that are a part of stress-response [50]). Notably, sequences tied to plasmid-specific genes, such as mobC and relaxase, were discerned in both Microbacterium species, a feature absent in their terrestrial analogs. This emphasizes the potential unique genetic adaptations of these space-borne bacteria. Building upon established research [33, 47], our analysis of proteomic alterations points to a significant enrichment across various protein classes. A particularly noteworthy observation is the global glycine enrichment, a phenomenon that aligns with findings from earlier studies on Acinetobacter sp., a desiccation-tolerant organism [17, 37, 51]. Historically, these organisms have not only displayed enhanced hydrophilicity but have also shown a fortified resistance to ionizing radiation, a stress factor intrinsically tied to redox reactions. The emphasis on these genetic mechanisms holds paramount importance, especially in the context of space-related stress factors. As organisms venture into space, they confront an array of unique and potent stressors, including elevated radiation, microgravity, and vacuum conditions. The genetic adaptability and resilience exhibited by certain organisms, as demonstrated by their proteomic profiles and specific enrichments, provide invaluable insights. These genetic mechanisms might well be the key to understanding how life can persist, and perhaps thrive, in the harsh environs of space. Such knowledge not only expands our understanding of extremophile biology but also informs potential biotechnological applications and space colonization strategies in the future. When looking at the singular case of metallopeptidase (aminopeptidase N) from M. meiriae and its closely-related Earth counterpart Microbacterium sp. LTR1, we observed almost perfect structure alignment, despite 43% sequence similarity. The changes in amino acid composition reflect the adaptations to the lifestyle of M. meiriae, with enrichment of arginine(s) and methionine(s), with the subsequent reduction of lysine and asparagine. Arginine is known to provide more stability to the structure than lysine [52–54]. Methionine in proteins plays an important role in cellular antioxidant activity, protein structure stabilization, and sequence-independent recognition of protein surfaces. It can also act as a regulatory switch through reversible oxidation and reduction (reviewed in [55]). This could hence explain its presence in the catalytic site (HEXXH motif) of aminopeptidase N. Drawing from foundational work such as that by Daly et al. [33], metalloproteins stand out as a consistently enriched protein class in strains adapted to space conditions. This enrichment pattern mirrors the remarkable adaptations seen in organisms like D. radiodurans, which has gained attention for its extraordinary radiation resistance [41]. The prominence of these metal-dependent enzymes in space-adapted strains is not merely a coincidence. These enzymes play a pivotal role in efficiently managing the redox stress that such microorganisms face in space. Their enrichment suggests an enhanced capability for early stress detection, with these enzymes acting as both environmental sensors and transcription factors. This is a vital adaptation, as space presents a plethora of unique stressors, with redox imbalances being a major concern. The ability of certain strains to bolster their defense mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of specific proteins, reveals the intricate genetic adaptations that enable survival in such hostile settings. These findings not only deepen our grasp of astrobiology but also have profound implications for potential biotechnological applications, hinting at ways to engineer organisms or systems for better resilience in space or other extreme conditions. The extreme ISS environment explains the need for metals scavenging to balance the redox stress, e.g., in the form of metalloproteins. The study of metallopeptidases is essential in the context of microbial adaptation to space conditions due to their significant roles in protein degradation, regulation of biological functions, and contribution to microbial virulence and biofilm formation [30]. This research is vital for ensuring the health and safety of astronauts, maintaining the integrity of space missions, and exploring new biotechnological applications. On the other hand, the prevalence of genes such as hemolysins, ferrochelatases, as well as protein glycosylation (mannose), antibiotic resistance and biofilm pathways indicates the risk of potential pathogenicity of the ISS-inhabiting microorganisms. These genes also appear in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives, but more studies needed to validate whether microgravity enhance the antibiotic resistance and biofilm production [56]. Conversely, these observations highlight the importance of metal uptake systems, which could lead to the development of antimicrobial agents utilized in the space habitat. Hemolysins are known to be repressed upon high Fe concentrations, as they are tools to scavenge it from the environment. On the other hand, LexA-mediated stress response is known to initiate bacteriocin synthesis [57]. Thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161 has been detected in the ISS organism A. burdickii [28] and the presence of BGCs encoding potentially novel antimicrobial molecules in the genomes of remaining four ISS species has been confirmed. Therefore, these organisms may serve as a source of potential new antimicrobial agents available upon spaceflight. In summary, the present study underscored the benefits of deep learning-based annotations, here using DeepFRI [58], which are able to go beyond the limitations of homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG [59]. In fact, DeepFRI enabled the construction of a comprehensive and cohesive picture of adaptations to space conditions. Nevertheless, combined use of annotations derived from all tools was applied to, e.g., mechanosensitive ion channel proteins (see Section 2.3.2). While traditional tools often relegated these genes to the ambiguous “hypothetical” category, DeepFRI was adept at providing precise annotations. This allowed for the discernment of novel BGCs, a finding that was further corroborated using specialized tools such as antiSMASH [28, 60]. In addition, a significant portion of these novel annotations pertained to membrane-associated proteins. This resonates with prior observations highlighting membrane-related adjustments. The challenge of studying the membrane proteome cannot be understated. Yet, with the recent augmentation of databases like AlphaFold [27] and ESM atlas [61], the scientific community has been endowed with a richer repository of membrane-bound protein structures. This surge in data availability paves the way for more refined structure-based annotations of novel genomes. This deep dive into the genetic underpinnings bears profound significance, especially when contextualized within space-related stress factors. As organisms confront the multifaceted challenges of space, their genetic machinery undergoes intricate recalibrations. By harnessing sophisticated annotation tools, we gain unparalleled insights into these genetic adaptations, potentially unlocking the secrets of space resilience. Such revelations not only propel our understanding of astrobiology forward but also spotlight the potential of genetic mechanisms in tailoring organisms for optimal performance in extraterrestrial environments.",

Copyright notice ID: 11451251 PMID: 39363369 Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments. Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Deinococcus species) [1, 2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions. As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6, 7]. In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space. This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8–13]. The exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis. Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]). For example, after 18 months of exposure, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10–40% survivability when UV was masked [1]. However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability. Similarly, dried Deinococcus cell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect. Moreover, D. radiodurans after being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters. In a recent study, a survival of D. radiodurans exposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16]. A comparative proteomics analysis of B. pumilus SAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the first-generation spores of B. pumilus SAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m2) compared to their ground control counterparts [1]. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17]. As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10, 15]. Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7]. However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits. This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial ‘dark matter’ in metagenomic sequencing outcomes. Research conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8–10, 12, 18]. Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts’ saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth. Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earth-bound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17, 20–23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species, Bacillus safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24]. This study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments. A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig. 1). These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed. The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space. Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models. This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment. In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of the project. Scheme created with BioRender.comResults Comparison of different annotations and between the isolates and within pangenome context Five novel species of Gram-positive bacteria that were isolated from the ISS were analyzed. Their generic features and the results of other molecular analyses are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. These bacteria were obtained from various flights, locations, and time periods, and are associated with different phylogenetic groups. The strain F6_3S_P_1C, which belongs to the Paenibacillus genus, has been identified as a spore-former, while the other four species were identified as non-spore-forming Actinobacteria. Through ANI and AAI analysis, we established closest Earth relatives (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Additionally, we performed synteny analysis [25] using all top ANI hits for each of the five organisms (Supplementary Table S1), but yielded no results (data not shown), thus indicating all ISS isolates are distinct species.

In total, the genomes of the novel species encompassed 1290 and 1184 shared MQ and HQ annotations (1778 all annotations, Fig. 2a, b). The majority of shared annotations were related to metabolism, followed by cellular processing and signaling and information storage and processing (Fig. 2c; all common annotations (GO terms) are detailed in Supplementary Table S12 in the Supplementary material). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Overview of the annotations common in all ISS species.

B Upset plot showing common annotations (derived from DeepFRI) with different groups of interests. C Clustering all isolates’ common annotations in the form of clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories. See the “Methods” for more detailsAnnotations unique to ISS bacterial species All curated  () genomes were used to find the closest terrestrial relatives for the novel ISS bacterial species and the genome that exhibited the highest average nucleotide identity (ANI) value was further compared with genomes of ISS strains to characterize unique annotation. When compared with their closest terrestrial relatives all ISS species have different numbers of unique annotations (Fig. 3a), which corresponds to their ANI (the higher the ANI, the fewer unique annotations). Additionally, two-dimensional Conserved Domain (CD)-hit clustering was performed between each isolate and its closest relative, using a 40% sequence similarity threshold. Thus, for each isolate a subgroup of unique genes (with no counterparts in their closest relative) was found (Supplementary Tables S2–S11). A comparison between these genes revealed the presence of 74 and 49 MQ and HQ common annotations, respectively (309 total annotations, Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table S13). Fig. 3.

Mma, Microbacterium mcarthurae (magenta); Mme, Microbacterium meiriae (orange); pLDDT, predicted local-distance difference test; pTM, predicted template modeling; TM, template modeling, see [26, 27]When aligning the novel genes in the genome context, we found the presence of potential novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in all species. These BGCs encode secondary metabolites such as terpenes, carotenes, betalactones, lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, non-ribosomal metallophores, furans, non-alpha poly-amino acids (NAPAA), type 3 polyketide synthase (T3PKS), ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP), proteusins (Supplementary Fig. S1), Our findings of BGCs are complimentary to the previously reported BGCs in A. burdickii, L. williamsii, and P. vandeheii [28]. We also expand the BGCs classification of the studied ISS species into the “novel” category, which are not found in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives. In this study, we report small molecule biosynthetic pathways, metal ion transporters and other transmembrane transporters. Furthermore, transcription factors associated with environmental stress have been found (Supplementary Table S14). Given the difference in ANI for each ISS-species:closest-relative pair, a different number of novel gens was obtained in each case, proportional to the phylogenetic distance (the lower the ANI, the more novel genes were found). We therefore focused on the two Microbacteria species, as their ANI to the closest relative was higher than 98%. Using Muscle, we aligned sequences of novel genes from each species together. We found an example of novel genes (Mma_002827 and Mme_000934) being present in both species with high (52.8%) sequence similarity. Given that initial annotation (“heavy metal associated domain,” “response to copper ion,” see Supplementary Tables S2 and S6), was sequence-based (see the “Methods\" for details), another approach was assayed, with structure prediction, followed by a functional annotation. Superpositions of predicted structures (both with pTM > 0.7 and pLDDT > 80) are almost identical (Fig. 3c). The structure-based deepFRI annotations reveal that these proteins have oxidoreductase activity (acting on CH-NH2 group of donors) and that are located in the extracellular layer of the cell (Supplementary Table S15). When compared to the proteome of D. radiodurans, weak structural homology was found to extracellular protein WP_027479552.1 (TM-score 0.34, see Supplementary Fig. S2). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposases were also found in all species except L. williamsii. There is also evidence of plasmid in some of the species (M. mcarthurae, M. meiriae), due to the presence of relaxosome encoding genes, such as MobC/L family relaxase (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S16). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Heatmap representing abundance of annotations of interest in the studied speciesComparison of proteome-level mutations in the ISS species and within pangenome context Several groups of proteins, important for adaptation to space environmental conditions were analyzed between ISS species and their closest Earth relatives. In metallopeptidases, the mutation rate of hydrophobic amino acids and glycine are higher than 1 in this protein group, suggesting an enrichment of these amino acids in the metallopeptidase proteins of ISS bacteria. These mutations might enhance the stability of these proteins under space environmental conditions (Fig. 4A). Glycine enrichment is a measure of how often the amino acid glycine appears in a protein sequence compared to what would be expected by chance (see the “Methods\" for more details). Significant glycine enrichment in a protein can suggest evolutionary pressures and adaptive responses to make proteins more flexible via mutation to glycine [29]. The metallopeptidase activity stands out as it exhibits consistent glycine enrichment across all strains, suggesting it may play a critical role in universal adaptive mechanisms (Fig. 4B). Other molecular functions, such as “ATP-dependent peptidase activity” and “2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity,” show high glycine enrichment, but only in both Microbaterium species, indicating potential taxonomy-based adaptations (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of mutation enrichment in ISS species across different protein families. A Clustering dendrogram representing enrichment in protein mutations (wrt closest relative) related to the protein group and type of mutation. B Mutation enrichment of selected proteins (wrt Uniprot database) with their significance scoresCertain molecular functions, such as “5 formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo ligase activity,” “ATP dependent peptidase activity,” and “ATP phosphoribosyltransferase activity,” display a high degree of hydrophobic amino acid enrichment, but only in M. meiriae and L. williamsii. This could suggest convergent adaptations involving changes in hydrophobicity of aforementioned proteins. Interestingly, “metallopeptidase activity” shows hydrophobic amino acid enrichment across all ISS species, albeit at a lower level than glycine enrichment. This could suggest a universal, but less dominant, adaptive strategy involving changes in protein hydrophobicity. These patterns underscore the complexity of potential adaptive strategies, highlighting the interplay between different types of amino acid changes in response to ISS environments (Fig. 4B). Metallopeptidases play role in celluar stress response [15], biofilm formation [30], as well as virulence [31] and hence are important factors in microbial adaptations to space conditions. Therefore, comparative analysis of sequences and structures of selected metallopeptidases from M. meiriae and its closest relative will be further discussed in the section below.Case studies of adaptations The functional annotations were further investigated to search for genes that would allow adaptation to life in space. The genes of interest were summarized in Fig. 5. Energy metabolism As previously reported [8–10, 12, 13, 18] metabolic rearrangements are essential part of adaptations to life in space (see overview in Fig. 1). Common annotations show the presence of genes encoding proteins related to carbohydrate, cofactors and coenzymes metabolism (Figs. 2c and 3b). Apart from genomic annotation (Supplementary Table S12), metabolic tests conducted on the ISS bacterial species reveal their ability to grow on a broad range of carbon sources, including cyclic compounds, oligo- and polysaccharides (Supplementary Fig. S3a–b). All species are capable of growing on 27 substrates being the sole carbon source, including carbohydrates (pectin, dextrin, mannose, fucose, gentibiose, lactose, melibiose, glucose, galactose, fructose as well as their branched and glycosylated derivatives), fatty acids (acetic acid, L-malic acid, sodium lactate and butyrate), amino acids (L-glutamic acid), alcohols (glycerol) and antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam). They can also grow at 1% NaCl concentration and pH6. Apart from the spore-forming P. vandeheii, the other bacteria can also utilize tween 40, gelatin, D-malic acid, L-lactic acid, propionic acid, D/L-serine, L-alanine, sorbitol, lincomycin, minocycline, nalidixic acid, rifamycin, as well as grow in the presence of lithium chloride. On the other hand, only P. vandeheii is able to grow in the presence of sodium bromate. Additionally to the species described by Simpson and colleagues [28], two species of Microbacterium were characterized for the first time. These species are able to utilize 72 carbon sources altogether (80 and 73 substrates for M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, respectively), grow at 8% NaCl concentration, as well as in the presence of lithium chloride and potassium tellurite. Unlike other species, either M. mcarthurae or M. meiriae can utilize α-keto-glutaric acid and citric acid.Mechanosensitive ion channels (Msc) and osmoprotectants Except for A. burdickii, each of the studied organisms has at least one copy of mscS gene annotated. Msc proteins are known to play a crucial role in adapting cells to the osmotic pressure [32]. Overall, two variants of Msc proteins exist: large conductance (3.6 nS) MscL and small conductance (1 nS) MscS. Large conductance channels are generally conserved and present in most bacteria as well as eukaryotes, although they are not found in deep sea species, where no pressure changes occur. Conversely, MscS are diverse structurally and functionally and occur in those organisms, which exhibit hypo-osmotic stress periodically (e.g., desiccation). MscS proteins have a common core architecture but show different gating mechanisms and conductive properties. Because low gravity conditions can be viewed as decrease in osmotic pressure, leading to the hypo-osmotic stress, their presence is therefore crucial for survival in ISS. All terrestrial relatives have a copy of mscS gene with over 90% sequence similarity to their homologous gene from the ISS species (Supplementary Fig. S4), except for L. williamsii, where there is an additional copy of the mscS with no homology in the genome of Leifsonia sp. ku-ls. Nevertheless, the presence of an additional copy of mscS gene could be due to the larger phylogenetic distance, as indicated by ANI (Fig. 3A). As for the osmoprotectants, there is no commonly shared metabolite, as genes related to betaine, choline, ectoine and trehalose synthesis are not present in all five species.Redox stress Changes in osmotic pressure, as well as exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have detrimental effects on cells. From the studies on Deinococcus it was found that it has elevated intracellular concentrations of Mn as well as Fe [33]. All studied ISS strains show an elevated number of metalloproteins compared to their closest terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S12). In the case of M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae, there are 27 and 25 unique metalloproteins, respectively (Supplementary Table S14), which include metallopeptidases, thioredoxins, metalloregulated transcription factors and heavy metal associated P-type ATPases. Metallopeptidases were of our special interest, as they showed certain adaptive mutations in all studied species (as described in previous section). Therefore, we decided to further analyze the metallopeptidase pair from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1. We found aminopeptidases in two of these species (Mme_001931 and WP_268776344.1 from M. meiriae and its terrestrial relative Microbacterium sp. LTR1, respectively), which share only 44% protein sequence similarity (58.4% nucleotide similarity, Supplementary Fig. S5). When structural models were calculated for these proteins (both with pTM-score ≫ 0.9), their superposition is almost identical (Fig. 6A), despite the low sequence similarity. When analyzing enrichment of the amino acids in Mme_001931 with WP_268776344.1 as a baseline, we observed enrichment of arginine and methionine, which were over 1.5 times more abundant compared to terrestrial protein. Opposite case was observed for lysine, which was over 2 times less abundant in ISS organism (Fig. 6B). When superimposed to deinococcal aminopeptidase (WP_0516188611), Mme_001931 exhibited similarly high TM-score (0.83), although the latter’s size is 1.81 times bigger than WP_0516188611 (Supplementary Fig. S6). In terms of amino acid enrichment, WP_051618861 also showed an elevated amount of arginines (8.3% wrt 5.5%) with subsequent decrease of lysines (1.1% wrt 2.6%) and increase in methionine with decrease of negatively charged amino acids, but also increase in glycines, histidines and prolines. Nonetheless, there is almost two times the size difference and further phylogenetic distance than in the case of M. meiriae (Supplementary Figure S6). Fig. 6.

Deinococcus radiodurans was extensively tested for its ability to protect and repair damaged DNA, which was due to its homologous recombination (HR) kit. All ISS species encode 10–14 genes related to HR, compared to 10 genes identified in D. radiodurans (Fig. 5). Similarly, all of the genomes share the set of rec, ruv, rad and uvr genes. In terms of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), all ISS strains share at least one gene. When compared with the Rec protein family from D. radiodurans and B. pumilus (Supplementary Fig. S7), clusters reflect phylogenetic distances. Moreover, all ISS strains share the LexA repressor (EC 3.4.21.88), which is part of the SOS response.Phage elements Phage elements were found in all genomes of ISS strains, with at least two phage-related genes found in each strain. Holin is a short protein containing few transmembrane regions. Although holin is usually accompanied by endolysin, there is no evidence of phage-related endolysin in any of the genome of ISS strains, suggesting that the phage elements could have been domesticated or removed. When tested with PHASTER software, prophage elements were detected only in the genome of P. vandeheii, as well as in its closest Earth relative (Supplementary Table S16).Potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance Common annotations (Supplementary Table S2) indicate the presence of genes with virulence potential, such as metallophores and hemolysins (including the group III family, which forms oligomeric complexes), which are present in all ISS strains. However, ISS strains often exhibit enhanced expression of these virulence genes due to the unique selective pressures of the space environment, such as microgravity and increased radiation. In contrast, Earth analogous strains show a greater diversity in these genes, driven by varied environmental challenges and human influences like antibiotic use and pollution ([34]. Genomes of all ISS bacterial species contain genes involved in biofilm formation, potentially posing a pathogenic risk to humans under specific conditions, even though these genera and their closest terrestrial relatives are not typically known to be infectious agents. Comparatively, Earth counterparts also form biofilms, but the selective pressures driving this ability differ. On Earth, biofilm formation is often a response to environmental challenges such as antibiotic exposure and surface colonization in diverse habitats. In contrast, ISS bacteria have shown adaptations favoring biofilm formation and surface interactions due to the unique conditions of the space environment, such as microgravity and limited nutrient availability [35]. Additionally, as Mora et al. highlighted in their work [36], the genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions, though not directly pertinent to human health, exhibit considerable adaptations for biofilm formation and surface interactions. Their research underscores the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent the formation of potentially harmful biofilms. Metabolic assays indicate that all ISS bacterial species have the ability to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds (Supplementary Fig. S3ab), showcasing their resilience in a controlled, high-stress environment. These bacteria also harbor various P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases within their pool of novel genes (Supplementary Table S12), suggesting advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance. Similarly, Earth analogs have evolved to degrade antimicrobial compounds, especially in environments heavily influenced by human activity, such as hospitals and agricultural sites [31].Discussion The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment. Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen. The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance. A specific set of genes was discovered to be present in all isolates but absent in their closest terrestrial relatives. This observation is consistent with earlier findings on the ISS-specific evolutionary patterns [37, 38]. Mannose is a known substrate of glycosylation in prokaryotes [39] and thus may play a role in cell wall modifications, cell adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, genes related to beta-mannosidase and mannose activities were up-regulated in high salinity media in the brine shrimp Artemia salina [40], suggesting that mannose and its derivatives may be accumulated as organic osmolytes. Clusters associated with small molecule and peptide biosynthesis in fungi were found in abundance, reaffirming earlier studies into molecular responses to microgravity [11]. The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. This suggests they might have a defense mechanism against hypoosmotic shocks. Furthermore, novel surface oxidoreductases have been identified in M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae which are not present in their terrestrial analogs. In light of these findings, a deeper investigation using comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is recommended. To perform meta-omic analysis while cultivating these microorganisms on ISS would be very challenging. Nevertheless, such studies were conducted before, e.g., Tanpopo mission [15], although this study focused on meta-omic analyses post-exposure. Conducting in vivo experiments on microogranisms could be performed via simulating some of the conditions experienced in ISS, e.g., increased radiation, vacuum or microgravity. Ground facilities to recreate these conditions exist and has been utilized in such experiments before ([41–43], also reviewed in [10]). It would therefore be possible to compare gene expression profile under these conditions, protein activity (e.g., extracellular metallopeptidases) or even assay secretion of certain metabolites (e.g., chelators, antibiotics) on indicative media. Efficient DNA repair and its impact on survival in the extreme conditions has long been studied in many organisms [41, 44, 45]. LexA repressor-mediated response is known to be crucial to DNA protection and repair process [46]. Studies on extremophilic bdelloid rotifers highlighted the linkage of efficient DNA repair mechanisms with the presence of high rates of HGT [47, 48]. The detection of MGEs underscores a significant genetic factor hinting at the selective pressures faced by species isolated from the ISS. Interestingly, the quantity of annotated transposases seems to be in proportion to genome size, with P. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment. Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [49] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication. Hence, it is possible that in the species described in this study the TEs are significantly diverged. Extremophilic lifestyle provides selective pressure on maintaining genome integrity. Therefore, TEs disruptive activity is expected to be quenched, at least in the non-spore forming species. On the other hand, P. vandeheii may have a different adaptation system, being a spore-former (such as D. radiodurans, which is known to contain TEs that are a part of stress-response [50]). Notably, sequences tied to plasmid-specific genes, such as mobC and relaxase, were discerned in both Microbacterium species, a feature absent in their terrestrial analogs. This emphasizes the potential unique genetic adaptations of these space-borne bacteria. Building upon established research [33, 47], our analysis of proteomic alterations points to a significant enrichment across various protein classes. A particularly noteworthy observation is the global glycine enrichment, a phenomenon that aligns with findings from earlier studies on Acinetobacter sp., a desiccation-tolerant organism [17, 37, 51]. Historically, these organisms have not only displayed enhanced hydrophilicity but have also shown a fortified resistance to ionizing radiation, a stress factor intrinsically tied to redox reactions. The emphasis on these genetic mechanisms holds paramount importance, especially in the context of space-related stress factors. As organisms venture into space, they confront an array of unique and potent stressors, including elevated radiation, microgravity, and vacuum conditions. The genetic adaptability and resilience exhibited by certain organisms, as demonstrated by their proteomic profiles and specific enrichments, provide invaluable insights. These genetic mechanisms might well be the key to understanding how life can persist, and perhaps thrive, in the harsh environs of space. Such knowledge not only expands our understanding of extremophile biology but also informs potential biotechnological applications and space colonization strategies in the future. When looking at the singular case of metallopeptidase (aminopeptidase N) from M. meiriae and its closely-related Earth counterpart Microbacterium sp. LTR1, we observed almost perfect structure alignment, despite 43% sequence similarity. The changes in amino acid composition reflect the adaptations to the lifestyle of M. meiriae, with enrichment of arginine(s) and methionine(s), with the subsequent reduction of lysine and asparagine. Arginine is known to provide more stability to the structure than lysine [52–54]. Methionine in proteins plays an important role in cellular antioxidant activity, protein structure stabilization, and sequence-independent recognition of protein surfaces. It can also act as a regulatory switch through reversible oxidation and reduction (reviewed in [55]). This could hence explain its presence in the catalytic site (HEXXH motif) of aminopeptidase N. Drawing from foundational work such as that by Daly et al. [33], metalloproteins stand out as a consistently enriched protein class in strains adapted to space conditions. This enrichment pattern mirrors the remarkable adaptations seen in organisms like D. radiodurans, which has gained attention for its extraordinary radiation resistance [41]. The prominence of these metal-dependent enzymes in space-adapted strains is not merely a coincidence. These enzymes play a pivotal role in efficiently managing the redox stress that such microorganisms face in space. Their enrichment suggests an enhanced capability for early stress detection, with these enzymes acting as both environmental sensors and transcription factors. This is a vital adaptation, as space presents a plethora of unique stressors, with redox imbalances being a major concern. The ability of certain strains to bolster their defense mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of specific proteins, reveals the intricate genetic adaptations that enable survival in such hostile settings. These findings not only deepen our grasp of astrobiology but also have profound implications for potential biotechnological applications, hinting at ways to engineer organisms or systems for better resilience in space or other extreme conditions. The extreme ISS environment explains the need for metals scavenging to balance the redox stress, e.g., in the form of metalloproteins. The study of metallopeptidases is essential in the context of microbial adaptation to space conditions due to their significant roles in protein degradation, regulation of biological functions, and contribution to microbial virulence and biofilm formation [30]. This research is vital for ensuring the health and safety of astronauts, maintaining the integrity of space missions, and exploring new biotechnological applications. On the other hand, the prevalence of genes such as hemolysins, ferrochelatases, as well as protein glycosylation (mannose), antibiotic resistance and biofilm pathways indicates the risk of potential pathogenicity of the ISS-inhabiting microorganisms. These genes also appear in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives, but more studies needed to validate whether microgravity enhance the antibiotic resistance and biofilm production [56]. Conversely, these observations highlight the importance of metal uptake systems, which could lead to the development of antimicrobial agents utilized in the space habitat. Hemolysins are known to be repressed upon high Fe concentrations, as they are tools to scavenge it from the environment. On the other hand, LexA-mediated stress response is known to initiate bacteriocin synthesis [57]. Thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161 has been detected in the ISS organism A. burdickii [28] and the presence of BGCs encoding potentially novel antimicrobial molecules in the genomes of remaining four ISS species has been confirmed. Therefore, these organisms may serve as a source of potential new antimicrobial agents available upon spaceflight. In summary, the present study underscored the benefits of deep learning-based annotations, here using DeepFRI [58], which are able to go beyond the limitations of homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG [59]. In fact, DeepFRI enabled the construction of a comprehensive and cohesive picture of adaptations to space conditions. Nevertheless, combined use of annotations derived from all tools was applied to, e.g., mechanosensitive ion channel proteins (see Section 2.3.2). While traditional tools often relegated these genes to the ambiguous “hypothetical” category, DeepFRI was adept at providing precise annotations. This allowed for the discernment of novel BGCs, a finding that was further corroborated using specialized tools such as antiSMASH [28, 60]. In addition, a significant portion of these novel annotations pertained to membrane-associated proteins. This resonates with prior observations highlighting membrane-related adjustments. The challenge of studying the membrane proteome cannot be understated. Yet, with the recent augmentation of databases like AlphaFold [27] and ESM atlas [61], the scientific community has been endowed with a richer repository of membrane-bound protein structures. This surge in data availability paves the way for more refined structure-based annotations of novel genomes. This deep dive into the genetic underpinnings bears profound significance, especially when contextualized within space-related stress factors. As organisms confront the multifaceted challenges of space, their genetic machinery undergoes intricate recalibrations. By harnessing sophisticated annotation tools, we gain unparalleled insights into these genetic adaptations, potentially unlocking the secrets of space resilience. Such revelations not only propel our understanding of astrobiology forward but also spotlight the potential of genetic mechanisms in tailoring organisms for optimal performance in extraterrestrial environments.Methods Bacteria isolation, genome assembly and annotation Sample collection and bacterial isolation from ISS were performed as previously described [23, 62]. Biochemical tests were performed using a Gram-positive identification card (Vitek 2 GP ID, bioMérieux) and phenotypic fingerprint was generated through GNIII MicroPlate according to BioLog’s protocol as described elsewhere [28]. We assembled the genomes of five novel bacterial species isolated from various surfaces of the ISS (specifically strains IF8SW-P5, IIF3SC_B10, F6_8S_P_1B, F6_8S_P_2B, F6_3S_P_1C), using the SPAdes workflow [63]. Phylogenetic affiliations are as outlined in [28] and presented in Table 1.DNA extraction The ISS isolates (n = 5) were grown on R2A medium and incubated at 30 °C, for 2 to 7 days. For WGS, DNA was isolated with the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit, and WGS libraries prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex kit. Sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 platform involved paired-end, 2 × 150 bp reads. FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC) and fastp [64] ensured data quality. WGS reads were assembled using SPAdes [63], with genome statistics from QUAST [65] and quality checks from CheckM [66]. Species verification through fastANI [67] and fastAAI (https://github.com/cruizperez/FastAAI) confirmed identities with over 95% identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) was estimated with GGDC using Formula 2 [68]. For genome synteny analysis, we used SynTracker [25].Genome annotation Following assembly, the contigs were subjected to the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) [69], available at https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki, in order to obtain draft genomes and proteomes. Genomes were further investigated for their functions, where all identified genes (bearing PGAP descriptions in their names) underwent homology-based annotation using eggNOG v5.0, accessible at https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper. Genomes of closest relatives of the ISS species (highest ANI) were also subjected to PGAP and eggNOG annotation. Proteomes with the PGAP identifiers were used as input for DeepFRI analysis [58], available on github: (https://github.com/bioinf-mcb/Metagenomic-DeepFRI/), which generated query contact map using results from mmseqs2 target database [70] search for similar protein sequences with known structures and with v 1.0 model weights. For reference database, we combined structures from Swissprot (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/download), microbiome immunity project (MIP) [71] and protein databank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org). Next, the contact map alignment was performed to use it as input to DeepFRI’s Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and annotations without the alignment to known structures were processed with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For MQ and HQ annotation, scores higher than or equal to 0.3 (50% of prediction confidence; MQ) and 0.5 (90% of prediction confidence; HQ) were used respectively (Figs. 2-3). All annotations for ISS strains and their terrestrial relatives are provided in Supplementary Tables S2–S11. Phylogenetically close relatives from Earth for each tested species were identified using ANI (Table 1). Their genomes were annotated using DeepFRI as described above. Protein sequences from the aforementioned five species were aligned and conducted two-dimensional clustering using CD-HIT [72], available at https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit, employing a 40% similarity threshold. Genes below that threshold were considered “novel” and subjected to analysis shown in Fig. 3A–B. Annotations (GO terms) were then compared between ISS strains (Supplementary Table S12) and their terrestrial counterparts (Supplementary Table S13). Common annotations were aggregated according to clusters of orthologous genes (COG) categories [73] using go2cog mapper (https://github.com/Tomasz-Lab/go2cog). GO terms that could be assigned to more than 3 COG categories were grouped as category R—“general function prediction” (Figs. 2 and 3). Heatmaps were generated using seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). Venn diagrams and Upsetplot were generated using matplotlib (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Using a knowledge-based approach, a set of genes was selected for further analysis. Protein structures were modeled using in silico structure prediction tool—AlphaFold Colab [27]—and hence obtained protein databank (PDB) format structures were aligned using Geneious Prime 2023.1.1 (Biomatters). Structures were aligned using TM-align tool [26]. Based on the predicted structure, novel functional annotation was performed using DeepFRI. All the annotation data and scripts are placed in the repository on github (https://github.com/lmszydlowski/Adaptation-of-novel-bacterial-species-isolated-from-the-International-Space-Station).Sequence alignments, functional annotations for plasmids, phage elements and biosynthetic gene clusters in the genome Sequences of selected proteins were aligned using Muscle 5.1 [74]. Clustering dendrograms were built using PhyML 3.3, [75] using LG amino acid substitution model and approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) for branch support. All contigs generated for each genome were scanned for potential plasmids using PLASme software (https://github.com/HubertTang/PLASMe), phage-related elements using PHASTER software [76, 77] and results provided in the Supplementary Tables S15–S16. Genome sequences were also processed through the AntiSMASH 7.0 software [60] to look for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) (Supplementary Table S14).Protein mutation and enrichment analysis To investigate the roles and processes of proteins highly enriched in bacteria from the ISS, we specifically focused on the enrichment of certain amino acids, especially proline and glycine, which belong to unique amino acid change groups. The amino acid compositions of proteins from the ISS strains were compared with those proteins found in the closest terrestrial species through global alignment methods [78]. This facilitates the identification and quantification of any shifts in the amino acid composition. These shifts were evaluated by calculating the mutation rate, which is achieved by dividing the number of amino acid substitutions in the ISS bacteria by the number of amino acid substitutions in their closest terrestrial relatives. Proteins with normalized amino acid mutation rate and Z-score above 1.96 or below − 1.96 were classified as enriched. To investigate the functions and pathways of these proteins, we utilize the g:Profiler enrichment tool (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost [79]). Custom gene sets for bacteria were created using UniProt’s [80] predicted GO term associations [81] for bacterial proteins. The tool was configured to include a minimum gene set size of 5 and a maximum of 10,000, focusing on molecular function GO terms. Shared gene sets between samples were filtered using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 in 1424 molecular function GO terms. Data visualization was enhanced through ete3 (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw046) for constructing phylogenetic trees and seaborn (https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) for generating heatmaps. The phylogenetic distance between bacterial species was calculated using ’s distance calculations, with the closest terrestrial bacteria as a reference.Supplementary Information 40168_2024_1916_MOESM1_ESM.zip (44.9MB, zip) Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure 1.
