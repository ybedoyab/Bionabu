    "abstract": "Abstract Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. These results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for preservation of cells. Subject terms: Proteins, Synthetic biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Water is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost complete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2. This phenomenon of “anhydrobiosis”, or “life without water” has attracted a great deal of attention because it may reveal Nature’s strategies to endure adverse environments and open up ways to achieve efficient preservation of living matter. However, the precise mechanisms behind anhydrobiosis remain elusive, as they may involve a complex combination of protective proteins, solutes, and cellular machinery working in a concert3. Several molecules have been identified as mediators of desiccation tolerance in various organisms. One is the disaccharide trehalose, which accumulates in a large quantity in animals such as brine shrimps or nematodes4. Trehalose uptake enhances the survival of yeast and human cells under drying conditions and may protect dehydrated cells by vitrification (turning the cell interior into a glass-like state)4–6. Several “intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)”, which lack fixed tertiary structure, have also been associated with desiccation tolerance2. For instance, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins are tolerance molecules found in plant seeds and anhydrobiotic species7. LEA proteins are mostly unstructured in an aqueous environment and assume helical structure upon desiccation to alleviate damage due to drying7,8. Recent studies on the survival mode of tardigrades revealed novel classes of stress proteins. Tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic animals that can survive under a broad range of environmental stressors, including desiccation, high and low temperatures, radiation, and even exposure to outer space9–11. Tardigrades express LEA proteins, and also three different families termed “tardigrade disordered proteins” (TDPs) unique to the phylum Tardigrada12. Some of these TDPs are highly disordered and less likely to undergo aggregation at high temperatures. (The classification of TDPs as disordered proteins is based on a sequence-based prediction13.) Three different groups of TDPs were termed cytoplasmic-, mitochondrial- and secretory-abundant heat soluble (CAHS, MAHS, SAHS) proteins according to their putative subcellular localization (Fig. 1a). In each family, the proteins show sequence similarity14,15. TDPs are either constitutively expressed at high levels or enriched upon desiccation and knocking out even one CAHS or SAHS gene can cause diminished desiccation tolerance13. Fig. 1. Classification and sequence analysis of tardigrade SAHS proteins. Open in a new tab a Classification of tardigrade-specific desiccation-protective proteins. Tardigrades express unique sets of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are further classified into three different subgroups, Cytosolic-, Mitochondrial- and Secretory-abundant heat soluble (C/M/SAHS) proteins, based on their subcellular localization. Created with BioRender.com. b An alignment of SAHS1-13 of R. varieornatus, SAHS4 of H. exemplaris, and two FABP (fatty acid binding protein) sequences, with amino acids whose side chains point inward toward the open cavity highlighted in orange, and those with side chains in the hydrophobic core highlighted in cyan. Underlined amino acid sequences at the N-termini of SAHS9, 10 and 12 are newly identified based on analysis of the R. varieornatus genome sequence. Underlined and bold sequences are putative N-linked glycosylation sites based on the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X not Pro). SAHS proteins are classified as secreted as they are generally encoded with signal sequences and are exported to the extracellular space upon expression in eukaryotes14. Sequence-based structural prediction suggested that, unlike CAHS and MAHS proteins that are estimated to be highly disordered, the 42 putative SAHS proteins from tardigrade species Hypsibius exemplaris, Ramazzottius varieornatus, Paramacrobiotus richtersi and Milnesium tardigradum are more ordered13. Fukuda et al. solved the structure of R. varieornatus SAHS1 and SAHS416,17, experimentally verifying that, at least under hydrated conditions, the SAHS proteins have defined structures, and their description as “intrinsically disordered proteins” is not accurate. RvSAHS1 and 4 proteins share sequence and structural similarity to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs): their structures include β-barrels with large internal cavities that correspond to the fatty acid binding pockets in FABPs16,17. The function of these large cavities in the SAHS proteins is unclear, as is their biochemical mechanism in protecting against desiccation. Additionally, AlphaFold structures are available on the protein structure database (PDB) for all SAHS proteins identified from R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris. In this study, we investigated SAHS proteins from tardigrades R. varieornatus and Hypsibius exemplaris for their potential to protect various biological structures from desiccation-induced damage. We expressed four different SAHS proteins and found that they can specifically protect liposomes and bacterial cells but not enzymes upon desiccation. SAHS proteins undergo structural changes under dehydration with trifluoroethanol. Finally, we performed molecular dynamic and bioinformatic analyses to identify structural features of the SAHS proteins that may contribute to desiccation protection. These studies lead to a model for SAHS protein action, and also illustrate that SAHS proteins may be practical preservatives for cells in commercial applications.",
    "methods": "Methods Sequence analysis SAHS protein sequences used for expression in E. coli (Figure S2) were obtained from Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org). Protein subcellular localization and signal peptides were predicted using TargetP 2.0 server available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk18. Genomic sequences encoding R. varieornatus SAHS proteins were from the Ramazzottius varieornatus contig Scaffold001, strain YOKOZUNA-1, whole genome shotgun sequence, GenBank accession number BDGG01000001, which encodes SAHS1-12, and Ramazzottius varieornatus contig Scaffold002, GenBank accession number BDGG01000002, which encodes SAHS 13. Protein expression and purification Expression vectors encoding His6/SUMO-tagged SAHS proteins were obtained from Twist Bioscience and transformed into LEMO21(DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs) according to the provider’s protocol. Transformed cells were grown in TBM-5052 autoinduction media containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin, 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol, and 2 mM l-rhamnose at 37 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g for 10 min, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme (Millipore Sigma), turbonuclease (Accelagen) and 1% n-Nonyl-Beta-d-Glucopyranoside (Cube Biotech) and shaken vigorously for 1 h. The total lysate was then centrifuged at 4000×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was obtained. This clarified protein lysate was then shaken with Ni-charged IMAC Magbeads (Genscript) for 1 h to bind tagged proteins. Beads were then washed 3 times with wash buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5), washed once more with PBS buffer, and incubated with PBS buffer supplemented with Cth SUMO protease19 at 0.02 mg/mL shaking overnight to achieve the cleavage of SAHS proteins from N-terminal SUMO tag. Cleaved proteins were recovered from the supernatant, filtered through 0.2 µm filters, concentrated using Amicon ultra 0.5 centrifugal columns (Millipore, 10 kDa MWCO), and stored at −20 °C. Purified proteins were inspected using SDS–PAGE and SimplyBlue staining (Invitrogen). Circular dichroism Proteins were buffer exchanged by overnight dialysis with 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. Protein secondary structure was examined using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) using a Jasco J-815 CD spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller and single cuvette holder. The CD spectra were obtained by averaging three wavelength scans from 200 to 260 nm in 0.5 nm steps in a cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. To examine protein secondary structures in water loss-mimicking conditions and molecular crowding conditions, trifluoroethanol (TFE) or glycerol was added to the sample at final concentrations ranging from 25% to 75% and incubated for two hours before determining the CD spectra. Lactate dehydrogenase inactivation assay l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme (Roche) was diluted to 0.01 mg/mL concentration in 100 µL of 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing various concentrations of SAHS proteins or BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). BSA were dialyzed against the same buffer prior to use. 50 µL of each sample was stored at 4 °C while the other 50 µL was dried using a Savant SPD131DDA SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h without heating. Dried samples were rehydrated, and activity was measured at 50× dilution in a buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6), 100 µM NADH, and 2 mM pyruvate. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek). Relative activity after dehydration was calculated by comparing the initial linear reaction rate of the dried sample to that of the non-dried control sample. Liposome drying assay POPC liposomes (100 nm, Tribioscience) dialyzed against PBS buffer were diluted to 1.4 mg/mL in 50 µL PBS buffer containing various concentrations of proteins and excipients. Proteins were dialyzed against the PBS buffer prior to use. Samples were then dried in a 250 µL microcentrifuge tube with an opened lid placed inside a 750-mL sealed chamber filled with about 42 grams of Drierite desiccant for 48 h at room temperature. Samples were rehydrated and diluted 10-fold, and the liposome sizes were measured using a Wyatt DynaPro Plate Reader III dynamic light scattering (DLS) device. Bacterial cell drying assay E. coli vectors expressing SAHS proteins without SUMO tags and with an N-terminal methionine were custom-ordered and obtained from Twist Bioscience and transformed into LEMO21(DE3) competent cells (NEB). To test for the effects of intracellular SAHS expression, cells transformed with each SAHS protein as well as mEGFP expression vector were grown in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin and 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol at 37 °C until OD600 of 0.6, added with 0.1 mM IPTG and 2 mM l-rhamnose and further grown at room temperature overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS buffer and diluted to contain 5 × 106 cells in 50 µL PBS buffer. Cells were then dried in a microcentrifuge tube with an opened lid placed inside a sealed chamber filled with Drierite desiccant for 48 h at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were rehydrated and immediately plated onto LB-agar Kan/Cm selection plates with a serial dilution to count the colony-forming units the next day. To test for protection by extracellular SAHS proteins, LEMO21(DE3) cells transformed with mEGFP expression vector were grown in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin, 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol at 37 °C overnight, without any rhamnose and inducer added. Subsequently, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS buffer and diluted to contain 5 × 106 cells in 50 µL PBS buffer supplemented with varying concentrations of SAHS proteins or other control excipients, dried, and rehydrated following the above protocol. BSA and excipients were dialyzed against the PBS buffer prior to use. For R. tropici drying assay, R. tropici CIAT 899 cells were grown in PY media overnight in round-bottom culture tubes. The culture tubes were placed in an incubator set to 28 °C and shaken at 200 rpm, then transferred to larger volume flasks the following day. Following incubation, the bacterial culture was centrifuged at 4000×g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and diluted to reach an OD600 of 0.4. The cultures were centrifuged again, and the supernatant was replaced with PBS buffer containing excipients. The solutions were pipetted into 250 µL tubes in 100 µL aliquots to contain a total of 7.2 × 108 cells and placed inside a sealed container with Drierite desiccant (10–20 mesh, Thermo Scientific) to allow the samples to dry for 48 h. Once the samples were dried, three samples of each condition were taken out at relevant time points and resuspended in PBS. Subsequently, the samples were diluted and spread onto PY agar plates for colony counting. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) SAHS proteins in PBS buffer were imaged by transmission electron microscopy using a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN TEM equipped with an AMT 2k CCD camera. TEM samples were prepared by depositing proteins onto carbon/formvar coated copper grids, staining with 2% uranyl acetate solution. Computational modeling and conservation analysis of RvSAHS1 An initial structure for RvSAHS1 was generated using alphaFold using the sequence acquired from UniProt with the accession code J7MFT5. Ambertools generated amber input files with the ff19SB forcefield and explicit TIP3 solvent conditions. OpenMM was used to simulate 1000 ns at a temperature of 550 K after an equilibration at 310 K for 1 ns. Trajectories were generated with conformations captured every 10 ps. RMSD analysis of the simulation trajectory was performed using the Python package mdtraj. Visualizations of protein structures were produced using Houdini (SideFX software) and the Python packages mdtraj, biopython, and prody. Additional details of computational methods are in Supplementary Information, and structural details are included in Supplementary Data 2. Evolutionary conservation analysis was performed on the RvSAHS1 sequence (J7MFT5) using ConSurf and the default parameters, where 60 homologs were collected from the UNIREF90 database using HMMER. Of these, 24 homologs passed the default thresholds (min/max similarity, coverage, etc.), and 25 were CD-HIT unique. The conservation calculations were conducted on the 25 unique hits, including the initial query. Statistics and reproducibility For the desiccation survival experiments, the Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance between the negative control (no excipient) and cells dried with SAHS proteins or excipients. The number of independent replicates is noted in the figure legend and separately attached source data. For the enzyme activity assay, the number of replicates is noted in the figure legend and source data.

    "results": "Results Protein sequence analysis and expression We selected 12 SAHS proteins from R. varieornatus and one from H. exemplaris to test for expression in the E. coli cytoplasm (Table S1). R. varieornatus is the most desiccation-resistant tardigrade and is well-characterized; a draft genome sequence is available, and crystal structures of two SAHS proteins from this organism have been solved16,17. We used the TargetP program18 that computationally predicts protein subcellular localization based on the N-terminal signal peptide, which predicted that only 8 out of 12 SAHS proteins would be secreted (Table S2). However, the surprising implication that some of the SAHS proteins might not be secreted also caused us to investigate genomic regions encoding these genes. We found that the “short” SAHS protein sequences in Uniprot that lack amino acids corresponding to the first ~40 amino acids of mature SAHS1 and SAHS4 may be incorrectly annotated; an alignment shown in Fig. 5 of Fukuda et al.16 shows three such proteins of the 13 SAHS proteins encoded by R. varieornatus. For example, the DNA encoding RvSAHS9 contains a splice acceptor immediately upstream of the putative start codon, further preceded by a splice donor and an in-frame coding sequence that encodes an amino acid sequence that aligns well with the N-terminus of other SAHS proteins; RvSAHS10 and RvSAHS12 have a similar organization (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Discussion). In each case, the new putative intron has a consensus splice donor, but the polypyrimidine tract of the splice acceptor has rather few pyrimidines, which may have misled the automated systems that analyzed the genomic sequences. When spliced out, the new N-terminal amino acid sequences align well with the other SAHS mature protein N-termini. We have further identified other candidate splice sites in these genes (Supplementary Discussion). We recombinantly expressed the Uniprot-predicted mature proteins RvSAHS1–4 and RvSAHS6-12 as well as HeSAHS4 in the E. Coli cytoplasm. The target proteins were expressed with an N-terminal SUMO tag, whose cleavage with a highly specific protease leaves the protein “scarless” without any extraneous amino acids remaining (Fig. S1a)19. Since the N-terminal signal sequences are expected to be cleaved during secretion, we expressed proteins without these sequences based on the cleavage sites predicted by TargetP (Table S3). We successfully expressed and purified 4 proteins (RvSAHS1, 4, 6, and HeSAHS4) with high soluble expression and purity and conducted subsequent studies using them (Figs. S1, S2). SAHS proteins stabilize liposomes from dehydration-induced damage As a first step of assessing the protective potential of SAHS proteins, we tested if they can stabilize lipid membranes upon dehydration-induced damages, using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes as a model membrane. Prior to drying, the diameter of the liposomes as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was in the range of 50-100 nm (Fig. 2a). Upon drying and rehydration at 1.4 mg/mL lipid concentration, less than 10% of the particles remained in this range, while larger particles appeared around 360 and 4000 nm (Fig. 2b). This marked increase in particle diameter indicated that dehydration damaged liposome membranes and promoted their fusion and/or aggregation20. Fig. 2. Tardigrade SAHS proteins stabilize liposomes from desiccation-induced damage. Open in a new tab POPC liposomes at 1.4 mg/mL were dried with and without the addition of SAHS proteins and BSA at varying concentrations of 0.1–10 mg/mL, and their size distributions were measured by DLS. a Size distribution of non-dried POPC liposomes. b Size distribution of POPC liposomes dried and rehydrated without additives. c–h Size distributions of the liposomes dried with c RvSAHS1, d RvSAHS4, e HeSAHS4, f RvSAHS6, g BSA, and h trehalose.Liposomes dried in the presence of SAHS proteins or other excipients at 10, 1, and 0.1 mg/mL concentrations were partially protected, with higher levels of excipient providing more protection. For all four SAHS proteins tested, particle sizes after a dehydration-rehydration cycle were notably smaller compared to those dried without an excipient (Figs. 2c–f and S3). While the diameters of the major peaks were slightly increased from ~60 nm to ~100 nm, none of the bigger particles having diameters larger than 200 nm were observed, which indicated that the addition of SAHS proteins prevented the fusion and aggregation of dried liposomes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), a commonly used excipient for protein preservation, was less effective in protecting liposomes than SAHS proteins, as indicated by the signal in ~500 nm range (Fig. 2g). Liposomes dried in 10 mg/mL trehalose showed no particles over 150 nm, suggesting that trehalose also prevented membrane fusion of dried liposomes (Fig. 2h). These observations indicated that SAHS proteins have comparable effects to trehalose in terms of their ability to stabilize membranes. SAHS proteins at lower concentrations of 1 mg/mL were also able to protect liposomes, whereas at 0.1 mg/mL, the extent of protection was diminished, and larger aggregates ~1000 nm were formed (Fig. 2c–f, dotted lines); also, the repeat experiments showed consistent results (Fig. S3). SAHS proteins enhance survival of desiccated bacterial cells We then tested whether extracellularly added SAHS proteins can enhance the desiccation tolerance of bacterial cells (Figs. 3 and S4). E. Coli cells were dried for 48 h at 108 cells/mL with 0.5 mg/mL of SAHS proteins. As measured by colony-forming units, E. coli showed enhanced survival compared to those dried without added excipients or with BSA, lactate dehydrogenase, or citrate synthase proteins (Fig. S4a), indicating that this was not a general effect caused by adding high concentration of protein. RvSAHS1 provided the most reproducible protection of E. coli, with all replicates in each experiment showing >10-fold enhancement of survival. At 0.1 mg/mL RvSAHS1, the protective effect decreased but was still statistically significant (Fig. S4b). Trehalose, a well-known cryoprotectant that is expressed intracellularly in many organisms during desiccation, also protected E. coli against drying when added extracellularly, but not as strongly as RvSAHS1. Intracellular expression of SAHS proteins showed no clear-cut enhancement of E. coli survival upon desiccation (Fig. S4c, d). Fig. 3. Tardigrade SAHS proteins enhance bacterial desiccation survival. Open in a new tab a E. Coli cells were dried for 48 h with and without the addition of 0.5 mg/mL concentration of SAHS proteins, BSA and trehalose. Survival percentage was calculated by comparing the number of viable colonies after plating the rehydrated cells to the initial number of cells added. b R. tropici cells were dried for 48 h with and without the addition of 0.5 mg/mL concentration of SAHS proteins, BSA, and trehalose. Survival percentage was calculated in the same way as the E. coli experiment. Individual data points represent independent replicates, and lines represent the mean survival. Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance between the negative control (no excipient) and each group, which is indicated as asterisks. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.We also tested if the SAHS proteins could enhance the desiccation survival of the plant-symbiotic bacterium Rhizobium tropici, which is a model organism for nitrogen-fixing biofertilizers. When R. tropici cells were dried at a concentration of 7.2 × 109 cells/mL with and without 0.5 mg/mL excipients, we observed ~40-fold enhancement of cell survival upon addition of SAHS proteins (Fig. 3b). Cells dried with trehalose at 0.5 mg/mL concentration showed 16-fold increased survival, while 0.5 mg/mL BSA caused a 4.2-fold increased survival. SAHS proteins and BSA protect enzymes from dehydration-induced inactivation Tardigrade proteins such as CAHS have been shown to protect desiccated enzyme activities21. We tested if the SAHS proteins can preserve an enzyme, specifically lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), from desiccation-induced inactivation in vitro. When dried, LDH (0.01 mg/mL) alone lost >90% of its activity compared to the non-dried control. The four SAHS proteins helped preserve LDH activity as a function of increasing concentration from 0.001 to 5 mg/mL, but BSA’s protective effect was comparable at each concentration (Figure S5). This observation contrasts with the specific effect of SAHS proteins vs. BSA on the protection of membranous structures such as liposomes and cells. Structural changes of SAHS proteins under desolvated conditions To investigate the behaviors of SAHS proteins upon water loss, we examined their secondary structures using circular dichroism (CD). CD spectra of all four SAHS proteins showed minima at ~215 nm, indicating that they adopt β-structures under aqueous conditions (Fig. 4a). This result was consistent with previous literature reporting β-sheet structures in RvSAHS1 and SAHS414,16,17. The CD spectra for SAHS1 and SAHS4 at 0% in aqueous solution correlate well with the solved structures of these proteins, which have a single short alpha helix and are dominated by beta strands. Fig. 4. Tardigrade SAHS proteins undergo structural changes upon dehydration-mimicking conditions. Open in a new tab a CD spectra of SAHS proteins upon the addition of increasing amounts of TFE from 0% to 75%. b Secondary structure compositions of SAHS proteins under different TFE levels, calculated from the CD spectra.To investigate if these proteins can change their structures upon environmental stress, we used increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and glycerol to mimic water-deficit conditions. All four proteins remained mostly β-stranded up to 25% TFE added but displayed a notable increase in helical structures at 50% TFE. At 50–75% TFE, all proteins showed spectra with two minima around 208 and 222 nm, which are characteristic of α-helices. This result is consistent with the earlier report by Yamaguchi et al., in which RvSAHS1 adopted a more helical structure with the addition of TFE14. Calculating relative secondary structure content confirmed that the helical content in these proteins increased from 10% up to 40% with the addition of TFE (Fig. 4b). In contrast, increasing concentrations of glycerol had no such effect, even though glycerol is a ‘crowding’ agent (Fig. S6). A filamentous, mesh-like structure was observed from dried RvSAHS1 proteins upon transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig. S7). RvSAHS1 proteins dried at a concentration of 1 mg/mL revealed an entangled network of fibrous structures, while those dried at a higher concentration of 10 mg/mL showed a denser network that covered most of the grid. Such observations suggested that RvSAHS1 may undergo structural changes upon loss of water to allow for higher-order structure formation. To further investigate the pathway for structural change of SAHS proteins, we conducted a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the RvSAHS1 protein. To account for the possible inter-protein interactions, we first generated a water bath with three copies of a RvSAHS1 monomer, and the simulation was conducted using explicit solvent, openMM, and the Amber force field. The simulation was performed for a microsecond at 550 K to induce the breaking of hydrogen bonds in a time frame amenable to simulation. We found that the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of alpha carbons in the ensemble relative to the starting structures increased within the first 100 ns and then plateaued for the remainder of the 1 µs (Figs. 5a, S8). As the simulation progressed, RvSAHS1 proteins showed the structural unfolding of beta-sheet structures and formation of alpha-helices: the beta-sheet component decreased from ~50% to ~3%, and the alpha-helical component increased from ~7% to ~20% as the simulation progressed from 0 to 100 ns (Fig. 5b).

Highlighted in blue and red are two highly conserved regions found within the beta-sheet region that directly interact through ionic bonds. Structures of these regions at 0 and 180 ns are indicated.Figure 5c shows the C-terminal segments of each monomer that are conserved among SAHS proteins, which contribute significantly to the initial beta-barrel structure (identified as the C3 motif in ref. 14). As the simulation progressed, this region highlighted how, as helices form, the motifs between subunits may become more closely aligned during the 0–100 ns simulation period. Figure 5d indicates how the beta-sheet region within the C3 motif, which is maintained through interactions between positively and negatively charged amino acid residues, gets separated to form a helix as the simulation proceeds. These sequences, highlighted in blue and red, were found to be highly conserved among the SAHS family (Fig. S9) based on our evolutionary conservation analysis using ConSurf 22, indicating that such structural shifts may be a shared trait among SAHS proteins. Structural bioinformatic analysis of SAHS proteins and related binding proteins To understand how SAHS proteins might undergo a dramatic transition from a beta-sheet conformation to a predominantly alpha-helical state and protect vesicles and cells during drying, we examined the solved structures of RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4, compared them with solved structures of fatty acid binding proteins from higher organisms, and analyzed patterns of sequence conservation. The structures of RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 (PDB IDs 5xna and 5z4g), fatty acid binding protein from human muscle (1hmr)23, the intracellular lipid binding protein FABP1 (6do6)24 were examined, along with alignments of related sequences. RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 are highly structured and similar to FABPs and related proteins16,17. Thus, the description of these proteins as “intrinsically disordered proteins” is not accurate, at least in the hydrated state. All of these proteins are unusual in that they have a large internal cavity that may be filled with ligands, solvent molecules, or both. The sides of the cavity are defined by beta sheets that, for the most part, do not pack against a typical hydrophobic core. In the RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 structures solved by Fukuda and colleagues, this volume is occupied by solvent molecules. In RvSAHS1, there is a small hydrophobic core, while the cavity is bordered by beta-hairpin loops from Phe50-His72, His83-Val96, Thr106-Ile113, Ala126-Asp139, and Lys150-Tyr163. (The Phe50-His72 loop also contains two short alpha helices.) In the absence of a ligand in the cavity, both faces of these loops are simply beta-sheets that face water on both sides. Thus, these structures would not be as stabilized as in a typical protein. We hypothesize that during a desiccation process, water would equilibrate out of the cavity, and as the environment becomes more dehydrated, other more stable proteins would pack against an SAHS protein, essentially crushing it and disrupting the beta-sheet structure that surrounds the cavity. In this way, the SAHS proteins could act as deformable packing material to prevent other biological structures from deforming or rupturing during desiccation. Among the 13 SAHS proteins of R. varieornatus, the amino acids pointing into the small hydrophobic center are generally conserved, while amino acids pointing into the cavity are not. The “hydrophobic core” is located on one side of the much larger interior and includes the amino acids Trp 32, Trp37, Met38, Trp41, Tyr64, Ile74, Trp75, Tyr81, Phe98, Leu100, Leu124, Tyr141, Val143, Leu148, and Ala159. Of these, Trp 32, Trp37, Met38, Trp41, Phe98, Leu100, Leu124, Tyr/Phe141, Val143, and Leu148 are rather well conserved, while the others are not. We note that the highly conserved tryptophans at positions 32, 37, and 41 are present in our newly proposed sequences for RvSAHS 9, 10, and 12, supporting the idea that these sequences were previously misannotated. The amino acids pointing inward towards the cavity include Phe50, Phe53, Ile54, Leu57, Leu59, His83, Ile85, Val87, Lys90, Tyr92, Asp94, Thr106, His108, Leu113, Tyr115, Tyr117, Ala126, Val128, Val130, Ile137, Asp139, Lys150, Tyr152, Arg151, and Tyr165. Most of these are within 4 Angstroms of ethylene glycol or the putative fatty acid in the RvSAHS1 structure16. Of these, Phe53, Val/Ile87, Tyr117, Arg/Lys161 and Tyr163 are largely conserved, and the hydrophobic residues Phe50, Ile54, Ile85, Ile118, Val123, Val125, and Ile137 are generally interchangeable with other hydrophobic residues. Arg/Lys161 is notable because it is conserved in fatty acid binding proteins and interacts with the carboxyl group in the fatty acid in the same way that this amino acid interacts with a carboxyl group on a putative fatty acid in the SAHS1 structure. Another feature of the SAHS proteins and fatty acid-binding proteins is the presence of an entry/exit point. In RvSAHS1, four turns define this area—three beta-hairpins with tips at Lys90, Asn109, and Ser132, and a one-turn alpha helix with Gln63 pointing towards the hole. The amino acid sequences around this region are extremely variable among the R. varieornatus SAHS proteins, with Gln63 and Ser132 near the edge of a gap in the alignment. Moreover, since the SAHS proteins are secreted eukaryotic proteins, they can undergo N-linked glycosylation at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites (which are not captured in proteins made in E. coli). The distribution of putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13 is strongly biased toward the amino acids surrounding the entry/exit site: Asn109 is likely N-glycosylated in RvSAHS1, 2, 8, 10, and 11 (and Asn107 in RvSAHS5); in RvSAHS3, 8 and 9 sites near Gln63 are likely glycosylated; and in RvSAHS5, 9 and 11 sites near Ser132 are glycosylated. RvSAHS4, 6, 12, and 13 do not have N-linked glycosylation sites. Of the 14 putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13, twelve are near the opening into the cavity. The presence/absence and positioning of these sites may have a significant effect on the movement of water and other small molecules in and out of the cavity. Fukuda et al. discussed the possibility that RvSAHS1 may bind a ligand with a carboxyl group (e.g. acetate) but noted that not all of the SAHS proteins have these carboxyl-binding residues17. Our analysis of alignments of the R. varieornatus SAHS proteins indicates a great deal of variation in the cavity-forming residues, implying that these proteins do not bind a common ligand (such as a fatty acid) if they bind one at all. Based on this analysis and data presented here, we propose a model by which the thirteen SAHS proteins encoded by R. varieornatus undergo a transition upon dehydration in which water molecules equilibrate out of the cavity and crowding and pressure of other proteins, then disrupt the structure of the SAHS proteins, which then might reconfigure into a completely different conformation. The thirteen different SAHS proteins would have different characteristics for stability and water retention, such that they would collapse under different conditions of dehydration and pressure, allowing for a gradual process rather than a sudden phase transition. This idea is explored further in the Discussion.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we tested the proteins belonging to the SAHS family of tardigrade proteins for their potential to protect diverse biological structures. In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures. Specifically, we found that the SAHS proteins protect membrane-containing structures, specifically liposomes and living bacteria, against desiccation-induced disruption but are no better than BSA at protecting the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase against desiccation. Based on CD analysis, the SAHS proteins appear to undergo a shift from a primarily beta-sheet structure to an alpha-helical structure in increasing TFE concentrations (thought to be desiccation-mimicking conditions), and a 1 μs molecular dynamic simulation showed that short alpha-helices can transiently form upon denaturation of proteins. Lastly, we performed a comparative structural analysis based on the available putative sequences of SAHS proteins. In doing so, we found that sequences in the Uniprot database corresponding to short (N-terminally truncated) SAHS proteins may have been incorrectly annotated and that all SAHS proteins are likely secreted and share a common structure. As noted previously, SAHS proteins are distantly related to fatty acid-binding proteins and consist of a large cavity and a small hydrophobic core off to one side. Our structural analysis indicated that amino acid side chains pointing into the cavity are variable, and putative N-linked glycosylation sites are also variable in position but tend to cluster around the opening from which solvent molecules might enter and exit. SAHS proteins from the tardigrades R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris are thought to contribute to the desiccation resistance of these organisms. R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris encode multiple different SAHS proteins, respectively, and at least some of them are constitutively expressed at high levels13. It is not clear why so many members of the SAHS family are encoded in these tardigrades or whether their diversity is important in desiccation protection. We tested several different SAHS proteins for their ability to be expressed in the E. coli cytoplasm without signal sequences. From R. varieornatus, SAHS1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were expressed, while the Uniprot-derived sequences of SAHS3, 9-12 were not. SAHS1, SAHS4, and SAHS6 from R. varieornatus and SAHS4 from H. exemplaris were expressed at the highest levels (Fig. S2) and were characterized further. The four tested SAHS proteins reduced the extent of liposome fusion and bacterial loss of viability during desiccation. When a commercial POPC-based liposome preparation was dried in the absence of excipients and then rehydrated, the average diameter of the liposomes increased from about 70 nm to about 350 nm, indicating that many liposomes fuse during this process to make much larger aggregates. In the presence of 10 mg/mL of any of the SAHS proteins, the extent of liposome fusion was much reduced, and even at lower concentrations, there was a protective effect. The excipient disaccharide trehalose showed a comparable protective effect, while BSA was less protective (Figs. 2, S3). When either E. coli or R. tropici was desiccated and rehydrated, the SAHS proteins had a strong survival-promoting effect, generally improving viability by about 50-fold and performing at least 10-fold better than BSA and several other proteins and about 3-fold better than trehalose (Figs. 3, S4). In addition, heterologous intracellular expression of SAHS proteins did not significantly improve E. coli desiccation survival (Fig. S4) R. tropici is a nitrogen-fixing plant symbiont that represents a working model for the preservation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as rhizobia and could itself be deployed as biofertilizer. In contrast, the SAHS proteins did not specifically protect the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase against loss of activity upon desiccation and rehydration—the SAHS proteins had a slight effect, comparable to the protective effect of BSA (Fig. S5). The ability to stabilize proteins/enzymes and prevent their aggregation has been associated with intracellular stress protection25,26. For instance, heterologous expressions of tardigrade small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) improved bacterial desiccation survival, and their protective mechanism has been attributed to their ability to reduce protein aggregation during desiccation27. Similarly, CAHS proteins, whose heterologous expressions in bacteria and yeast enhanced their desiccation survival, were superior to BSA in protecting enzymes from desiccation-induced inactivation in vitro13,21. The SAHS proteins tested in this study are presumed to function extracellularly, and it might be that their main role is not to protect proteins but to prevent damage to membranes. The solved structures of two SAHS proteins and the pattern of amino acid conservation in the SAHS proteins (Fig. 6) indicate that the SAHS proteins all have a large cavity that may simply be full of water. (An alternative hypothesis, suggested by our AlphaFold-predicted structure of multiple SAHS proteins, would be that the N-terminus of one SAHS protein fits into the cavity of another (Fig. S10); no independent evidence supports this hypothesis.) The SAHS proteins are similar in sequence to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), and the SAHS and FABP structures are superimposable. However, the amino acid side chains that point inward in the SAHS protein cavity are not strongly conserved, suggesting that these proteins are not binding to a particular ligand but may simply be filled with water or with variable solutes. Moreover, in FABPs the cavity is significantly larger than can be occupied by a fatty acid, and since fatty acids are moving in and out of the cavity during intracellular transport, they are presumably exchanged with water in this process.

Amino acids in cyan with side chains shown define the hydrophobic core. Large spheres show the alpha carbons of asparagines in an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence in at least one SAHS protein. The putative opening of the cavity is on the left. b Structure of SAHS1, rotated 90 °C relative to panel A with the left side coming forward. All the side chains are shown. This view illustrates the opening into the cavity of the protein, such that the cyan-colored hydrophobic core side chains at the back of the protein can be seen through this hole. SAHS proteins, by analogy to CAHS proteins14, may undergo a shift to an alternative conformation in desiccation conditions. A high-temperature MD simulation of three SAHS proteins in a water box revealed that, as the beta-barrel structure of the protein became disordered, short alpha-helical regions would form and disappear (Fig. 5, S8). These structures might nucleate the formation of an alternative, protective conformation. However, the use of molecular dynamics to simulate desiccation is challenging because, during actual desiccation, the concentration of other proteins would increase and may play a dominating role in a conformational change of SAHS proteins, for example, through Brownian collisions. Moreover, desiccation occurs on long timescales that cannot be simulated with current molecular dynamics technology. One model for the protective mechanism of SAHS proteins is that the SAHS protein cavity is filled with water and possibly other solutes in the hydrated state, but during dehydration, the water is extruded. Thus, the SAHS protein would collapse as a result of the Brownian motion of macromolecules and pressure on the outside of the protein without a corresponding pressure from the inside. This would lead to the denaturation of the protein and transition to an alternative, protective conformation. The different SAHS proteins may have different kinetics and equilibria for this transition, such that when a tardigrade is dehydrated, there is a gradual conversion of the different SAHS proteins to a protective state. The presence or absence and positioning of N-linked oligosaccharides in the different SAHS proteins near the entry/exit point may give them distinct dehydration-transition characteristics. After the conversion from a globular conformation, the SAHS proteins may form higher-order, gel-like structures that stabilize membrane-bound elements of cells, which may constitute rampart-like “special extracellular structure (SES)” observed outside of the secretory cell membranes of dried tardigrade28. SAHS proteins may have a practical application in protecting non-tardigrade cells, such as agricultural microbes, against desiccation. We found that two bacteria, E. coli and R. tropici, could be stabilized against desiccation by the presence of a single SAHS protein. R. tropici is a “plant-growth promoting rhizobacterium,” and PGPR use is often limited by their low desiccation tolerance29,30, highlighting the potential applicability of SAHS proteins to improve the durability of microbial biofertilizers. Also, desiccation would enable easier and lower-cost transportation and safer handling of these microbes in the field. In summary, this work provides the evaluation of tardigrade SAHS proteins in terms of their protective abilities, which supports their potential applications as stabilizing molecules.",

Copyright notice ID: 11127935 PMID: 38796644 Abstract Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. These results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for preservation of cells. Subject terms: Proteins, Synthetic biology Tardigrade secretory-abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins protect biological structures such as liposomes and microbial cells from dehydration-induced damages, potentially through undergoing structural transition upon desiccation.Introduction Water is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost complete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2. This phenomenon of “anhydrobiosis”, or “life without water” has attracted a great deal of attention because it may reveal Nature’s strategies to endure adverse environments and open up ways to achieve efficient preservation of living matter. However, the precise mechanisms behind anhydrobiosis remain elusive, as they may involve a complex combination of protective proteins, solutes, and cellular machinery working in a concert3. Several molecules have been identified as mediators of desiccation tolerance in various organisms. One is the disaccharide trehalose, which accumulates in a large quantity in animals such as brine shrimps or nematodes4. Trehalose uptake enhances the survival of yeast and human cells under drying conditions and may protect dehydrated cells by vitrification (turning the cell interior into a glass-like state)4–6. Several “intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)”, which lack fixed tertiary structure, have also been associated with desiccation tolerance2. For instance, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins are tolerance molecules found in plant seeds and anhydrobiotic species7. LEA proteins are mostly unstructured in an aqueous environment and assume helical structure upon desiccation to alleviate damage due to drying7,8. Recent studies on the survival mode of tardigrades revealed novel classes of stress proteins. Tardigrades (water bears) are microscopic animals that can survive under a broad range of environmental stressors, including desiccation, high and low temperatures, radiation, and even exposure to outer space9–11. Tardigrades express LEA proteins, and also three different families termed “tardigrade disordered proteins” (TDPs) unique to the phylum Tardigrada12. Some of these TDPs are highly disordered and less likely to undergo aggregation at high temperatures. (The classification of TDPs as disordered proteins is based on a sequence-based prediction13.) Three different groups of TDPs were termed cytoplasmic-, mitochondrial- and secretory-abundant heat soluble (CAHS, MAHS, SAHS) proteins according to their putative subcellular localization (Fig. 1a). In each family, the proteins show sequence similarity14,15. TDPs are either constitutively expressed at high levels or enriched upon desiccation and knocking out even one CAHS or SAHS gene can cause diminished desiccation tolerance13. Fig. 1. Classification and sequence analysis of tardigrade SAHS proteins. Open in a new tab a Classification of tardigrade-specific desiccation-protective proteins. Tardigrades express unique sets of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are further classified into three different subgroups, Cytosolic-, Mitochondrial- and Secretory-abundant heat soluble (C/M/SAHS) proteins, based on their subcellular localization. Created with BioRender.com. b An alignment of SAHS1-13 of R. varieornatus, SAHS4 of H. exemplaris, and two FABP (fatty acid binding protein) sequences, with amino acids whose side chains point inward toward the open cavity highlighted in orange, and those with side chains in the hydrophobic core highlighted in cyan. Underlined amino acid sequences at the N-termini of SAHS9, 10 and 12 are newly identified based on analysis of the R. varieornatus genome sequence. Underlined and bold sequences are putative N-linked glycosylation sites based on the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X not Pro).SAHS proteins are classified as secreted as they are generally encoded with signal sequences and are exported to the extracellular space upon expression in eukaryotes14. Sequence-based structural prediction suggested that, unlike CAHS and MAHS proteins that are estimated to be highly disordered, the 42 putative SAHS proteins from tardigrade species Hypsibius exemplaris, Ramazzottius varieornatus, Paramacrobiotus richtersi and Milnesium tardigradum are more ordered13. Fukuda et al. solved the structure of R. varieornatus SAHS1 and SAHS416,17, experimentally verifying that, at least under hydrated conditions, the SAHS proteins have defined structures, and their description as “intrinsically disordered proteins” is not accurate. RvSAHS1 and 4 proteins share sequence and structural similarity to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs): their structures include β-barrels with large internal cavities that correspond to the fatty acid binding pockets in FABPs16,17. The function of these large cavities in the SAHS proteins is unclear, as is their biochemical mechanism in protecting against desiccation. Additionally, AlphaFold structures are available on the protein structure database (PDB) for all SAHS proteins identified from R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris. In this study, we investigated SAHS proteins from tardigrades R. varieornatus and Hypsibius exemplaris for their potential to protect various biological structures from desiccation-induced damage. We expressed four different SAHS proteins and found that they can specifically protect liposomes and bacterial cells but not enzymes upon desiccation. SAHS proteins undergo structural changes under dehydration with trifluoroethanol. Finally, we performed molecular dynamic and bioinformatic analyses to identify structural features of the SAHS proteins that may contribute to desiccation protection. These studies lead to a model for SAHS protein action, and also illustrate that SAHS proteins may be practical preservatives for cells in commercial applications.Results Protein sequence analysis and expression We selected 12 SAHS proteins from R. varieornatus and one from H. exemplaris to test for expression in the E. coli cytoplasm (Table S1). R. varieornatus is the most desiccation-resistant tardigrade and is well-characterized; a draft genome sequence is available, and crystal structures of two SAHS proteins from this organism have been solved16,17. We used the TargetP program18 that computationally predicts protein subcellular localization based on the N-terminal signal peptide, which predicted that only 8 out of 12 SAHS proteins would be secreted (Table S2). However, the surprising implication that some of the SAHS proteins might not be secreted also caused us to investigate genomic regions encoding these genes. We found that the “short” SAHS protein sequences in Uniprot that lack amino acids corresponding to the first ~40 amino acids of mature SAHS1 and SAHS4 may be incorrectly annotated; an alignment shown in Fig. 5 of Fukuda et al.16 shows three such proteins of the 13 SAHS proteins encoded by R. varieornatus. For example, the DNA encoding RvSAHS9 contains a splice acceptor immediately upstream of the putative start codon, further preceded by a splice donor and an in-frame coding sequence that encodes an amino acid sequence that aligns well with the N-terminus of other SAHS proteins; RvSAHS10 and RvSAHS12 have a similar organization (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Discussion). In each case, the new putative intron has a consensus splice donor, but the polypyrimidine tract of the splice acceptor has rather few pyrimidines, which may have misled the automated systems that analyzed the genomic sequences. When spliced out, the new N-terminal amino acid sequences align well with the other SAHS mature protein N-termini. We have further identified other candidate splice sites in these genes (Supplementary Discussion). We recombinantly expressed the Uniprot-predicted mature proteins RvSAHS1–4 and RvSAHS6-12 as well as HeSAHS4 in the E. Coli cytoplasm. The target proteins were expressed with an N-terminal SUMO tag, whose cleavage with a highly specific protease leaves the protein “scarless” without any extraneous amino acids remaining (Fig. S1a)19. Since the N-terminal signal sequences are expected to be cleaved during secretion, we expressed proteins without these sequences based on the cleavage sites predicted by TargetP (Table S3). We successfully expressed and purified 4 proteins (RvSAHS1, 4, 6, and HeSAHS4) with high soluble expression and purity and conducted subsequent studies using them (Figs. S1, S2).SAHS proteins stabilize liposomes from dehydration-induced damage As a first step of assessing the protective potential of SAHS proteins, we tested if they can stabilize lipid membranes upon dehydration-induced damages, using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes as a model membrane. Prior to drying, the diameter of the liposomes as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was in the range of 50-100 nm (Fig. 2a). Upon drying and rehydration at 1.4 mg/mL lipid concentration, less than 10% of the particles remained in this range, while larger particles appeared around 360 and 4000 nm (Fig. 2b). This marked increase in particle diameter indicated that dehydration damaged liposome membranes and promoted their fusion and/or aggregation20. Fig. 2. Tardigrade SAHS proteins stabilize liposomes from desiccation-induced damage. Open in a new tab POPC liposomes at 1.4 mg/mL were dried with and without the addition of SAHS proteins and BSA at varying concentrations of 0.1–10 mg/mL, and their size distributions were measured by DLS. a Size distribution of non-dried POPC liposomes. b Size distribution of POPC liposomes dried and rehydrated without additives. c–h Size distributions of the liposomes dried with c RvSAHS1, d RvSAHS4, e HeSAHS4, f RvSAHS6, g BSA, and h trehalose.Liposomes dried in the presence of SAHS proteins or other excipients at 10, 1, and 0.1 mg/mL concentrations were partially protected, with higher levels of excipient providing more protection. For all four SAHS proteins tested, particle sizes after a dehydration-rehydration cycle were notably smaller compared to those dried without an excipient (Figs. 2c–f and S3). While the diameters of the major peaks were slightly increased from ~60 nm to ~100 nm, none of the bigger particles having diameters larger than 200 nm were observed, which indicated that the addition of SAHS proteins prevented the fusion and aggregation of dried liposomes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), a commonly used excipient for protein preservation, was less effective in protecting liposomes than SAHS proteins, as indicated by the signal in ~500 nm range (Fig. 2g). Liposomes dried in 10 mg/mL trehalose showed no particles over 150 nm, suggesting that trehalose also prevented membrane fusion of dried liposomes (Fig. 2h). These observations indicated that SAHS proteins have comparable effects to trehalose in terms of their ability to stabilize membranes. SAHS proteins at lower concentrations of 1 mg/mL were also able to protect liposomes, whereas at 0.1 mg/mL, the extent of protection was diminished, and larger aggregates ~1000 nm were formed (Fig. 2c–f, dotted lines); also, the repeat experiments showed consistent results (Fig. S3).SAHS proteins enhance survival of desiccated bacterial cells We then tested whether extracellularly added SAHS proteins can enhance the desiccation tolerance of bacterial cells (Figs. 3 and S4). E. Coli cells were dried for 48 h at 108 cells/mL with 0.5 mg/mL of SAHS proteins. As measured by colony-forming units, E. coli showed enhanced survival compared to those dried without added excipients or with BSA, lactate dehydrogenase, or citrate synthase proteins (Fig. S4a), indicating that this was not a general effect caused by adding high concentration of protein. RvSAHS1 provided the most reproducible protection of E. coli, with all replicates in each experiment showing >10-fold enhancement of survival. At 0.1 mg/mL RvSAHS1, the protective effect decreased but was still statistically significant (Fig. S4b). Trehalose, a well-known cryoprotectant that is expressed intracellularly in many organisms during desiccation, also protected E. coli against drying when added extracellularly, but not as strongly as RvSAHS1. Intracellular expression of SAHS proteins showed no clear-cut enhancement of E. coli survival upon desiccation (Fig. S4c, d). Fig. 3. Tardigrade SAHS proteins enhance bacterial desiccation survival. Open in a new tab a E. Coli cells were dried for 48 h with and without the addition of 0.5 mg/mL concentration of SAHS proteins, BSA and trehalose. Survival percentage was calculated by comparing the number of viable colonies after plating the rehydrated cells to the initial number of cells added. b R. tropici cells were dried for 48 h with and without the addition of 0.5 mg/mL concentration of SAHS proteins, BSA, and trehalose. Survival percentage was calculated in the same way as the E. coli experiment. Individual data points represent independent replicates, and lines represent the mean survival. Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance between the negative control (no excipient) and each group, which is indicated as asterisks. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.We also tested if the SAHS proteins could enhance the desiccation survival of the plant-symbiotic bacterium Rhizobium tropici, which is a model organism for nitrogen-fixing biofertilizers. When R. tropici cells were dried at a concentration of 7.2 × 109 cells/mL with and without 0.5 mg/mL excipients, we observed ~40-fold enhancement of cell survival upon addition of SAHS proteins (Fig. 3b). Cells dried with trehalose at 0.5 mg/mL concentration showed 16-fold increased survival, while 0.5 mg/mL BSA caused a 4.2-fold increased survival.SAHS proteins and BSA protect enzymes from dehydration-induced inactivation Tardigrade proteins such as CAHS have been shown to protect desiccated enzyme activities21. We tested if the SAHS proteins can preserve an enzyme, specifically lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), from desiccation-induced inactivation in vitro. When dried, LDH (0.01 mg/mL) alone lost >90% of its activity compared to the non-dried control. The four SAHS proteins helped preserve LDH activity as a function of increasing concentration from 0.001 to 5 mg/mL, but BSA’s protective effect was comparable at each concentration (Figure S5). This observation contrasts with the specific effect of SAHS proteins vs. BSA on the protection of membranous structures such as liposomes and cells.Structural changes of SAHS proteins under desolvated conditions To investigate the behaviors of SAHS proteins upon water loss, we examined their secondary structures using circular dichroism (CD). CD spectra of all four SAHS proteins showed minima at ~215 nm, indicating that they adopt β-structures under aqueous conditions (Fig. 4a). This result was consistent with previous literature reporting β-sheet structures in RvSAHS1 and SAHS414,16,17. The CD spectra for SAHS1 and SAHS4 at 0% in aqueous solution correlate well with the solved structures of these proteins, which have a single short alpha helix and are dominated by beta strands. Fig. 4. Tardigrade SAHS proteins undergo structural changes upon dehydration-mimicking conditions. Open in a new tab a CD spectra of SAHS proteins upon the addition of increasing amounts of TFE from 0% to 75%. b Secondary structure compositions of SAHS proteins under different TFE levels, calculated from the CD spectra.To investigate if these proteins can change their structures upon environmental stress, we used increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and glycerol to mimic water-deficit conditions. All four proteins remained mostly β-stranded up to 25% TFE added but displayed a notable increase in helical structures at 50% TFE. At 50–75% TFE, all proteins showed spectra with two minima around 208 and 222 nm, which are characteristic of α-helices. This result is consistent with the earlier report by Yamaguchi et al., in which RvSAHS1 adopted a more helical structure with the addition of TFE14. Calculating relative secondary structure content confirmed that the helical content in these proteins increased from 10% up to 40% with the addition of TFE (Fig. 4b). In contrast, increasing concentrations of glycerol had no such effect, even though glycerol is a ‘crowding’ agent (Fig. S6). A filamentous, mesh-like structure was observed from dried RvSAHS1 proteins upon transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig. S7). RvSAHS1 proteins dried at a concentration of 1 mg/mL revealed an entangled network of fibrous structures, while those dried at a higher concentration of 10 mg/mL showed a denser network that covered most of the grid. Such observations suggested that RvSAHS1 may undergo structural changes upon loss of water to allow for higher-order structure formation. To further investigate the pathway for structural change of SAHS proteins, we conducted a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the RvSAHS1 protein. To account for the possible inter-protein interactions, we first generated a water bath with three copies of a RvSAHS1 monomer, and the simulation was conducted using explicit solvent, openMM, and the Amber force field. The simulation was performed for a microsecond at 550 K to induce the breaking of hydrogen bonds in a time frame amenable to simulation. We found that the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of alpha carbons in the ensemble relative to the starting structures increased within the first 100 ns and then plateaued for the remainder of the 1 µs (Figs. 5a, S8). As the simulation progressed, RvSAHS1 proteins showed the structural unfolding of beta-sheet structures and formation of alpha-helices: the beta-sheet component decreased from ~50% to ~3%, and the alpha-helical component increased from ~7% to ~20% as the simulation progressed from 0 to 100 ns (Fig. 5b).

Highlighted in blue and red are two highly conserved regions found within the beta-sheet region that directly interact through ionic bonds. Structures of these regions at 0 and 180 ns are indicated.Figure 5c shows the C-terminal segments of each monomer that are conserved among SAHS proteins, which contribute significantly to the initial beta-barrel structure (identified as the C3 motif in ref. 14). As the simulation progressed, this region highlighted how, as helices form, the motifs between subunits may become more closely aligned during the 0–100 ns simulation period. Figure 5d indicates how the beta-sheet region within the C3 motif, which is maintained through interactions between positively and negatively charged amino acid residues, gets separated to form a helix as the simulation proceeds. These sequences, highlighted in blue and red, were found to be highly conserved among the SAHS family (Fig. S9) based on our evolutionary conservation analysis using ConSurf 22, indicating that such structural shifts may be a shared trait among SAHS proteins.Structural bioinformatic analysis of SAHS proteins and related binding proteins To understand how SAHS proteins might undergo a dramatic transition from a beta-sheet conformation to a predominantly alpha-helical state and protect vesicles and cells during drying, we examined the solved structures of RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4, compared them with solved structures of fatty acid binding proteins from higher organisms, and analyzed patterns of sequence conservation. The structures of RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 (PDB IDs 5xna and 5z4g), fatty acid binding protein from human muscle (1hmr)23, the intracellular lipid binding protein FABP1 (6do6)24 were examined, along with alignments of related sequences. RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 are highly structured and similar to FABPs and related proteins16,17. Thus, the description of these proteins as “intrinsically disordered proteins” is not accurate, at least in the hydrated state. All of these proteins are unusual in that they have a large internal cavity that may be filled with ligands, solvent molecules, or both. The sides of the cavity are defined by beta sheets that, for the most part, do not pack against a typical hydrophobic core. In the RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 structures solved by Fukuda and colleagues, this volume is occupied by solvent molecules. In RvSAHS1, there is a small hydrophobic core, while the cavity is bordered by beta-hairpin loops from Phe50-His72, His83-Val96, Thr106-Ile113, Ala126-Asp139, and Lys150-Tyr163. (The Phe50-His72 loop also contains two short alpha helices.) In the absence of a ligand in the cavity, both faces of these loops are simply beta-sheets that face water on both sides. Thus, these structures would not be as stabilized as in a typical protein. We hypothesize that during a desiccation process, water would equilibrate out of the cavity, and as the environment becomes more dehydrated, other more stable proteins would pack against an SAHS protein, essentially crushing it and disrupting the beta-sheet structure that surrounds the cavity. In this way, the SAHS proteins could act as deformable packing material to prevent other biological structures from deforming or rupturing during desiccation. Among the 13 SAHS proteins of R. varieornatus, the amino acids pointing into the small hydrophobic center are generally conserved, while amino acids pointing into the cavity are not. The “hydrophobic core” is located on one side of the much larger interior and includes the amino acids Trp 32, Trp37, Met38, Trp41, Tyr64, Ile74, Trp75, Tyr81, Phe98, Leu100, Leu124, Tyr141, Val143, Leu148, and Ala159. Of these, Trp 32, Trp37, Met38, Trp41, Phe98, Leu100, Leu124, Tyr/Phe141, Val143, and Leu148 are rather well conserved, while the others are not. We note that the highly conserved tryptophans at positions 32, 37, and 41 are present in our newly proposed sequences for RvSAHS 9, 10, and 12, supporting the idea that these sequences were previously misannotated. The amino acids pointing inward towards the cavity include Phe50, Phe53, Ile54, Leu57, Leu59, His83, Ile85, Val87, Lys90, Tyr92, Asp94, Thr106, His108, Leu113, Tyr115, Tyr117, Ala126, Val128, Val130, Ile137, Asp139, Lys150, Tyr152, Arg151, and Tyr165. Most of these are within 4 Angstroms of ethylene glycol or the putative fatty acid in the RvSAHS1 structure16. Of these, Phe53, Val/Ile87, Tyr117, Arg/Lys161 and Tyr163 are largely conserved, and the hydrophobic residues Phe50, Ile54, Ile85, Ile118, Val123, Val125, and Ile137 are generally interchangeable with other hydrophobic residues. Arg/Lys161 is notable because it is conserved in fatty acid binding proteins and interacts with the carboxyl group in the fatty acid in the same way that this amino acid interacts with a carboxyl group on a putative fatty acid in the SAHS1 structure. Another feature of the SAHS proteins and fatty acid-binding proteins is the presence of an entry/exit point. In RvSAHS1, four turns define this area—three beta-hairpins with tips at Lys90, Asn109, and Ser132, and a one-turn alpha helix with Gln63 pointing towards the hole. The amino acid sequences around this region are extremely variable among the R. varieornatus SAHS proteins, with Gln63 and Ser132 near the edge of a gap in the alignment. Moreover, since the SAHS proteins are secreted eukaryotic proteins, they can undergo N-linked glycosylation at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites (which are not captured in proteins made in E. coli). The distribution of putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13 is strongly biased toward the amino acids surrounding the entry/exit site: Asn109 is likely N-glycosylated in RvSAHS1, 2, 8, 10, and 11 (and Asn107 in RvSAHS5); in RvSAHS3, 8 and 9 sites near Gln63 are likely glycosylated; and in RvSAHS5, 9 and 11 sites near Ser132 are glycosylated. RvSAHS4, 6, 12, and 13 do not have N-linked glycosylation sites. Of the 14 putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13, twelve are near the opening into the cavity. The presence/absence and positioning of these sites may have a significant effect on the movement of water and other small molecules in and out of the cavity. Fukuda et al. discussed the possibility that RvSAHS1 may bind a ligand with a carboxyl group (e.g. acetate) but noted that not all of the SAHS proteins have these carboxyl-binding residues17. Our analysis of alignments of the R. varieornatus SAHS proteins indicates a great deal of variation in the cavity-forming residues, implying that these proteins do not bind a common ligand (such as a fatty acid) if they bind one at all. Based on this analysis and data presented here, we propose a model by which the thirteen SAHS proteins encoded by R. varieornatus undergo a transition upon dehydration in which water molecules equilibrate out of the cavity and crowding and pressure of other proteins, then disrupt the structure of the SAHS proteins, which then might reconfigure into a completely different conformation. The thirteen different SAHS proteins would have different characteristics for stability and water retention, such that they would collapse under different conditions of dehydration and pressure, allowing for a gradual process rather than a sudden phase transition. This idea is explored further in the Discussion.Discussion In this study, we tested the proteins belonging to the SAHS family of tardigrade proteins for their potential to protect diverse biological structures. In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures. Specifically, we found that the SAHS proteins protect membrane-containing structures, specifically liposomes and living bacteria, against desiccation-induced disruption but are no better than BSA at protecting the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase against desiccation. Based on CD analysis, the SAHS proteins appear to undergo a shift from a primarily beta-sheet structure to an alpha-helical structure in increasing TFE concentrations (thought to be desiccation-mimicking conditions), and a 1 μs molecular dynamic simulation showed that short alpha-helices can transiently form upon denaturation of proteins. Lastly, we performed a comparative structural analysis based on the available putative sequences of SAHS proteins. In doing so, we found that sequences in the Uniprot database corresponding to short (N-terminally truncated) SAHS proteins may have been incorrectly annotated and that all SAHS proteins are likely secreted and share a common structure. As noted previously, SAHS proteins are distantly related to fatty acid-binding proteins and consist of a large cavity and a small hydrophobic core off to one side. Our structural analysis indicated that amino acid side chains pointing into the cavity are variable, and putative N-linked glycosylation sites are also variable in position but tend to cluster around the opening from which solvent molecules might enter and exit. SAHS proteins from the tardigrades R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris are thought to contribute to the desiccation resistance of these organisms. R. varieornatus and H. exemplaris encode multiple different SAHS proteins, respectively, and at least some of them are constitutively expressed at high levels13. It is not clear why so many members of the SAHS family are encoded in these tardigrades or whether their diversity is important in desiccation protection. We tested several different SAHS proteins for their ability to be expressed in the E. coli cytoplasm without signal sequences. From R. varieornatus, SAHS1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were expressed, while the Uniprot-derived sequences of SAHS3, 9-12 were not. SAHS1, SAHS4, and SAHS6 from R. varieornatus and SAHS4 from H. exemplaris were expressed at the highest levels (Fig. S2) and were characterized further. The four tested SAHS proteins reduced the extent of liposome fusion and bacterial loss of viability during desiccation. When a commercial POPC-based liposome preparation was dried in the absence of excipients and then rehydrated, the average diameter of the liposomes increased from about 70 nm to about 350 nm, indicating that many liposomes fuse during this process to make much larger aggregates. In the presence of 10 mg/mL of any of the SAHS proteins, the extent of liposome fusion was much reduced, and even at lower concentrations, there was a protective effect. The excipient disaccharide trehalose showed a comparable protective effect, while BSA was less protective (Figs. 2, S3). When either E. coli or R. tropici was desiccated and rehydrated, the SAHS proteins had a strong survival-promoting effect, generally improving viability by about 50-fold and performing at least 10-fold better than BSA and several other proteins and about 3-fold better than trehalose (Figs. 3, S4). In addition, heterologous intracellular expression of SAHS proteins did not significantly improve E. coli desiccation survival (Fig. S4) R. tropici is a nitrogen-fixing plant symbiont that represents a working model for the preservation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as rhizobia and could itself be deployed as biofertilizer. In contrast, the SAHS proteins did not specifically protect the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase against loss of activity upon desiccation and rehydration—the SAHS proteins had a slight effect, comparable to the protective effect of BSA (Fig. S5). The ability to stabilize proteins/enzymes and prevent their aggregation has been associated with intracellular stress protection25,26. For instance, heterologous expressions of tardigrade small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) improved bacterial desiccation survival, and their protective mechanism has been attributed to their ability to reduce protein aggregation during desiccation27. Similarly, CAHS proteins, whose heterologous expressions in bacteria and yeast enhanced their desiccation survival, were superior to BSA in protecting enzymes from desiccation-induced inactivation in vitro13,21. The SAHS proteins tested in this study are presumed to function extracellularly, and it might be that their main role is not to protect proteins but to prevent damage to membranes. The solved structures of two SAHS proteins and the pattern of amino acid conservation in the SAHS proteins (Fig. 6) indicate that the SAHS proteins all have a large cavity that may simply be full of water. (An alternative hypothesis, suggested by our AlphaFold-predicted structure of multiple SAHS proteins, would be that the N-terminus of one SAHS protein fits into the cavity of another (Fig. S10); no independent evidence supports this hypothesis.) The SAHS proteins are similar in sequence to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), and the SAHS and FABP structures are superimposable. However, the amino acid side chains that point inward in the SAHS protein cavity are not strongly conserved, suggesting that these proteins are not binding to a particular ligand but may simply be filled with water or with variable solutes. Moreover, in FABPs the cavity is significantly larger than can be occupied by a fatty acid, and since fatty acids are moving in and out of the cavity during intracellular transport, they are presumably exchanged with water in this process.

Open in a new tab a Structure of SAHS1 from Fukuda et al.16, showing an alpha-carbon trace of all amino acids, with the beta-hairpins surrounding the cavity colored in yellow, yellow-orange, orange and red. Amino acids in cyan with side chains shown define the hydrophobic core. Large spheres show the alpha carbons of asparagines in an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence in at least one SAHS protein. The putative opening of the cavity is on the left. b Structure of SAHS1, rotated 90 °C relative to panel A with the left side coming forward. All the side chains are shown. This view illustrates the opening into the cavity of the protein, such that the cyan-colored hydrophobic core side chains at the back of the protein can be seen through this hole.SAHS proteins, by analogy to CAHS proteins14, may undergo a shift to an alternative conformation in desiccation conditions. A high-temperature MD simulation of three SAHS proteins in a water box revealed that, as the beta-barrel structure of the protein became disordered, short alpha-helical regions would form and disappear (Fig. 5, S8). These structures might nucleate the formation of an alternative, protective conformation. However, the use of molecular dynamics to simulate desiccation is challenging because, during actual desiccation, the concentration of other proteins would increase and may play a dominating role in a conformational change of SAHS proteins, for example, through Brownian collisions. Moreover, desiccation occurs on long timescales that cannot be simulated with current molecular dynamics technology. One model for the protective mechanism of SAHS proteins is that the SAHS protein cavity is filled with water and possibly other solutes in the hydrated state, but during dehydration, the water is extruded. Thus, the SAHS protein would collapse as a result of the Brownian motion of macromolecules and pressure on the outside of the protein without a corresponding pressure from the inside. This would lead to the denaturation of the protein and transition to an alternative, protective conformation. The different SAHS proteins may have different kinetics and equilibria for this transition, such that when a tardigrade is dehydrated, there is a gradual conversion of the different SAHS proteins to a protective state. The presence or absence and positioning of N-linked oligosaccharides in the different SAHS proteins near the entry/exit point may give them distinct dehydration-transition characteristics. After the conversion from a globular conformation, the SAHS proteins may form higher-order, gel-like structures that stabilize membrane-bound elements of cells, which may constitute rampart-like “special extracellular structure (SES)” observed outside of the secretory cell membranes of dried tardigrade28. SAHS proteins may have a practical application in protecting non-tardigrade cells, such as agricultural microbes, against desiccation. We found that two bacteria, E. coli and R. tropici, could be stabilized against desiccation by the presence of a single SAHS protein. R. tropici is a “plant-growth promoting rhizobacterium,” and PGPR use is often limited by their low desiccation tolerance29,30, highlighting the potential applicability of SAHS proteins to improve the durability of microbial biofertilizers. Also, desiccation would enable easier and lower-cost transportation and safer handling of these microbes in the field. In summary, this work provides the evaluation of tardigrade SAHS proteins in terms of their protective abilities, which supports their potential applications as stabilizing molecules.Methods Sequence analysis SAHS protein sequences used for expression in E. coli (Figure S2) were obtained from Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org). Protein subcellular localization and signal peptides were predicted using TargetP 2.0 server available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk18. Genomic sequences encoding R. varieornatus SAHS proteins were from the Ramazzottius varieornatus contig Scaffold001, strain YOKOZUNA-1, whole genome shotgun sequence, GenBank accession number BDGG01000001, which encodes SAHS1-12, and Ramazzottius varieornatus contig Scaffold002, GenBank accession number BDGG01000002, which encodes SAHS 13.Protein expression and purification Expression vectors encoding His6/SUMO-tagged SAHS proteins were obtained from Twist Bioscience and transformed into LEMO21(DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs) according to the provider’s protocol. Transformed cells were grown in TBM-5052 autoinduction media containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin, 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol, and 2 mM l-rhamnose at 37 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g for 10 min, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme (Millipore Sigma), turbonuclease (Accelagen) and 1% n-Nonyl-Beta-d-Glucopyranoside (Cube Biotech) and shaken vigorously for 1 h. The total lysate was then centrifuged at 4000×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was obtained. This clarified protein lysate was then shaken with Ni-charged IMAC Magbeads (Genscript) for 1 h to bind tagged proteins. Beads were then washed 3 times with wash buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5), washed once more with PBS buffer, and incubated with PBS buffer supplemented with Cth SUMO protease19 at 0.02 mg/mL shaking overnight to achieve the cleavage of SAHS proteins from N-terminal SUMO tag. Cleaved proteins were recovered from the supernatant, filtered through 0.2 µm filters, concentrated using Amicon ultra 0.5 centrifugal columns (Millipore, 10 kDa MWCO), and stored at −20 °C. Purified proteins were inspected using SDS–PAGE and SimplyBlue staining (Invitrogen).Circular dichroism Proteins were buffer exchanged by overnight dialysis with 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. Protein secondary structure was examined using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) using a Jasco J-815 CD spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller and single cuvette holder. The CD spectra were obtained by averaging three wavelength scans from 200 to 260 nm in 0.5 nm steps in a cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. To examine protein secondary structures in water loss-mimicking conditions and molecular crowding conditions, trifluoroethanol (TFE) or glycerol was added to the sample at final concentrations ranging from 25% to 75% and incubated for two hours before determining the CD spectra.Lactate dehydrogenase inactivation assay l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme (Roche) was diluted to 0.01 mg/mL concentration in 100 µL of 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer containing various concentrations of SAHS proteins or BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). BSA were dialyzed against the same buffer prior to use. 50 µL of each sample was stored at 4 °C while the other 50 µL was dried using a Savant SPD131DDA SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h without heating. Dried samples were rehydrated, and activity was measured at 50× dilution in a buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6), 100 µM NADH, and 2 mM pyruvate. Absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek). Relative activity after dehydration was calculated by comparing the initial linear reaction rate of the dried sample to that of the non-dried control sample.Liposome drying assay POPC liposomes (100 nm, Tribioscience) dialyzed against PBS buffer were diluted to 1.4 mg/mL in 50 µL PBS buffer containing various concentrations of proteins and excipients. Proteins were dialyzed against the PBS buffer prior to use. Samples were then dried in a 250 µL microcentrifuge tube with an opened lid placed inside a 750-mL sealed chamber filled with about 42 grams of Drierite desiccant for 48 h at room temperature. Samples were rehydrated and diluted 10-fold, and the liposome sizes were measured using a Wyatt DynaPro Plate Reader III dynamic light scattering (DLS) device.Bacterial cell drying assay E. coli vectors expressing SAHS proteins without SUMO tags and with an N-terminal methionine were custom-ordered and obtained from Twist Bioscience and transformed into LEMO21(DE3) competent cells (NEB). To test for the effects of intracellular SAHS expression, cells transformed with each SAHS protein as well as mEGFP expression vector were grown in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin and 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol at 37 °C until OD600 of 0.6, added with 0.1 mM IPTG and 2 mM l-rhamnose and further grown at room temperature overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS buffer and diluted to contain 5 × 106 cells in 50 µL PBS buffer. Cells were then dried in a microcentrifuge tube with an opened lid placed inside a sealed chamber filled with Drierite desiccant for 48 h at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were rehydrated and immediately plated onto LB-agar Kan/Cm selection plates with a serial dilution to count the colony-forming units the next day. To test for protection by extracellular SAHS proteins, LEMO21(DE3) cells transformed with mEGFP expression vector were grown in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL Kanamycin, 25 µg/mL Chloramphenicol at 37 °C overnight, without any rhamnose and inducer added. Subsequently, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS buffer and diluted to contain 5 × 106 cells in 50 µL PBS buffer supplemented with varying concentrations of SAHS proteins or other control excipients, dried, and rehydrated following the above protocol. BSA and excipients were dialyzed against the PBS buffer prior to use. For R. tropici drying assay, R. tropici CIAT 899 cells were grown in PY media overnight in round-bottom culture tubes. The culture tubes were placed in an incubator set to 28 °C and shaken at 200 rpm, then transferred to larger volume flasks the following day. Following incubation, the bacterial culture was centrifuged at 4000×g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and diluted to reach an OD600 of 0.4. The cultures were centrifuged again, and the supernatant was replaced with PBS buffer containing excipients. The solutions were pipetted into 250 µL tubes in 100 µL aliquots to contain a total of 7.2 × 108 cells and placed inside a sealed container with Drierite desiccant (10–20 mesh, Thermo Scientific) to allow the samples to dry for 48 h. Once the samples were dried, three samples of each condition were taken out at relevant time points and resuspended in PBS. Subsequently, the samples were diluted and spread onto PY agar plates for colony counting.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) SAHS proteins in PBS buffer were imaged by transmission electron microscopy using a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN TEM equipped with an AMT 2k CCD camera. TEM samples were prepared by depositing proteins onto carbon/formvar coated copper grids, staining with 2% uranyl acetate solution.Computational modeling and conservation analysis of RvSAHS1 An initial structure for RvSAHS1 was generated using alphaFold using the sequence acquired from UniProt with the accession code J7MFT5. Ambertools generated amber input files with the ff19SB forcefield and explicit TIP3 solvent conditions. OpenMM was used to simulate 1000 ns at a temperature of 550 K after an equilibration at 310 K for 1 ns. Trajectories were generated with conformations captured every 10 ps. RMSD analysis of the simulation trajectory was performed using the Python package mdtraj. Visualizations of protein structures were produced using Houdini (SideFX software) and the Python packages mdtraj, biopython, and prody. Additional details of computational methods are in Supplementary Information, and structural details are included in Supplementary Data 2. Evolutionary conservation analysis was performed on the RvSAHS1 sequence (J7MFT5) using ConSurf and the default parameters, where 60 homologs were collected from the UNIREF90 database using HMMER. Of these, 24 homologs passed the default thresholds (min/max similarity, coverage, etc.), and 25 were CD-HIT unique. The conservation calculations were conducted on the 25 unique hits, including the initial query.Statistics and reproducibility For the desiccation survival experiments, the Student’s t-test was used to determine the statistical significance between the negative control (no excipient) and cells dried with SAHS proteins or excipients. The number of independent replicates is noted in the figure legend and separately attached source data. For the enzyme activity assay, the number of replicates is noted in the figure legend and source data.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Peer Review File (961KB, pdf) Supplementary Information (2.6MB, pdf) Description of Supplementary Materials (14.8KB, docx) Supplementary Data 1 (1.2MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (765.1KB, zip) Reporting Summary (473KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University as the validation project.

    "abstract": "Abstract Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants. Keywords: anhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation tolerance",
    "introduction": "Introduction Anhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism (Crowe et al., 1998; Keilin, 1959). An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more (García, 2011; Hibshman et al., 2020; Leprince and Buitink, 2015). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al., 1998; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (Goyal et al., 2005; Kikawada et al., 2006; MacRae, 2016), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al., 2010; King and MacRae, 2015), and ROS scavenging (Gusev et al., 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance (Janis et al., 2018). Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state (Rebecchi et al., 2007; Wright, 2001). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuner et al., 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010; Schokraie et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2022), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat-soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed in Ramazzottius varieornatus, which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance without de novo gene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade, Hypsibius exemplaris, the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance (Arakawa, 2022; Kondo et al., 2015, 2019; Yoshida et al., 2017). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic predictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous structures in vitro and in cells (Malki et al., 2022; Tanaka et al., 2022; Veling et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, and Drosphila S2 cells (Boothby et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2022). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization of R. varieornatus CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress.",
    "methods": "Methods Plasmid construction All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1, along with Benchling links to the plasmid sequences and maps. Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The cDNAs of R. varieornatus CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, LEAM, and MAHS were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector (Niwa et al., 1991) for transient expression experiments (Fig. 1) and the pT2A vector (pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE) for drug-inducible expression experiments (Fig. 2 and 3). Of note, since CAHS proteins are known to be abundantly expressed in tardigrades, we optimized the codon of the CAHS genes in order to express sufficient amounts of CAHS proteins in HeLa cells. The Tol2-based transposon donor vector (pT2A) and the Tol2 transposase expression vector (pCAGGS-T2TP) were kindly provided by Koichi Kawakami (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) (Kawakami and Noda, 2004). The cDNAs of rtTA (Roney et al., 2016) synthesized by FASMAC, tet-response element, and multiple cloning sites were inserted into a Tol2 donor vector by ligation and Gibson assembly to generate pTol2puro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS. The cDNAs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP), CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were subcloned into the pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS vector. Fig. 1.

Although t-test was conducted for the data compared with the mEGFP data, the statistical significance was not observed. Cell culture HeLa cells were kindly provided by Michiyuki Matsuda (Kyoto University). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) high glucose (#08458-45, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (#F7524, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Establishment of stable cell lines For transposon-mediated gene transfer, HeLa cells were transfected with Tol2 donor vectors and Tol2 transposase-expressing vectors in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 16–24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin (#ant-pr-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) for more than one week to select bulk cell lines. Cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin. In Fig. 2, the bright fluorescent cells were sorted into a 96-well plate using a cell sorter (MA900, SONY, Tokyo, Japan), and the single cell clone was used in Fig. 2. The bulk cell population was used in Fig. 3. Time-lapse imaging with hyperosmotic stress HeLa cells were seeded on a 35-mm dish (#150460, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) or a 6 well plate (#140675, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The plasmid expressing the CAHS1-mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were loaded onto a microfluidic plate (M04S-03-5PK, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The microfluidic plates were controlled by a CellASIC ONIX2 Microfluidic System (CAX2-S0000, Millipore). After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing FluoroBriteTM DMEM (#A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAXTM Supplement (#35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi (“psi” is a unit of pressure) while heating at 37°C by a temperature-controllable manifold (CAX2-MXT20, Millipore). For hyperosmotic shock experiments, 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution were prepared as follows: 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW and 5 M sodium chloride in DDW were dissolved by the imaging medium, resulting in 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution, respectively. The transfected cells seeded on microfluidic plates were time-lapse imaged under the imaging medium condition every 10 sec for 2 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 1 psi while heating at 37°C. Then, 0.5 M sorbitol solution or 0.2 M sodium chloride solution was added, and fluorescence images were acquired every 10 sec for 5 min. The hyperosmotic medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. After incubation, the hyperosmotic medium was replaced with the imaging medium, and the cells were observed every 10 sec for 10 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus/Evident, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Fusion BT, Hamamatsu photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-W1, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Musashino, Japan), and diode lasers at a wavelength of 488 nm. An oil immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO100XO, N.A. 1.45, Olympus/Evident) was used. The excitation laser and fluorescence filter settings were as follows: excitation laser, 488 nm; dichroic mirror (DM), 405/488/561 nm; and emission filters, 500–550 nm. During the observation, the cells were incubated with microfluidic plates at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). The background was subtracted by a constant value. If salt-and-pepper noise was not negligible, a median filter with 1-pixel was applied. To compensate for the misregistration caused during time-lapse imaging, the “StackReg function” was applied with the “Translation” option. Fluorescence imaging for quantifying expression levels HeLa cells carrying the doxycycline-inducible expression cassette of CAHS1, 3, 8, 12-mEGFP or mEGFP were seeded on a 96-well plate (#167008, Thermo Fisher Scientific). One day after seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of doxycycline, and 24 h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus/Evident) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 4000R, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), an excitation light source (Spectra-X light engine, Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), a laser-based autofocus system (IX2-ZDC, Olympus/Evident), a controller for filter wheels and XY stage (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), and an incubation chamber (STXG-IX3WX, Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan). An objective lens (UPlanApo 10x, N.A. 0.40, Olympus/Evident) was used. For EGFP imaging, a 475/28 excitation filter, a 20/80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT, Japan), and a 542/27 emission filter (Semrock, IDEX Health & Science, LLC, West Henrietta, NY, USA) were used. During the observation, live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). The background was subtracted by the rolling ball method. The region of interest (ROI) of each cell was extracted with the “StarDistD2” function (Probability/Score Threshold: 0.55), and the fluorescence intensity (Mean value) of each ROI was obtained with the “Measure” function. Cell viability assay and cell death assay For the cell viability assay and the cell death assay, a low serum concentration medium (1% FBS), hereinafter referred to as the assay medium, was used to reduce the background absorbance in the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay because serum contains LDH. The assay medium contains 1x DME culture solution (#639-29631, Nitta Gelatin, Yao, Japan), 1% FBS, 26 mM NaHCO3 (#09655-25, Nacalai Tesque), and 1 μg/mL puromycin (if needed). For hyperosmotic stress, a 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was prepared by mixing 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW, 5x DME culture solution, 260 mM NaHCO3, 100% FBS, DDW, and 1 mg/mL puromycin. This 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of sorbitol solution. For drug-inducible gene expression, 1 mg/mL doxycycline (#D4116, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of doxycycline solution in the assay medium. HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103 cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay (Fig. 2), half of the cell supernatant was used for the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay with a Premix WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay System (#MK400, TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401, TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both the WST-1 and LDH release assays were evaluated based on absorbance at 450 nm (and 620 nm as a control) using a microplate reader (#51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The absorbance values obtained from the microplate reader were exported and analyzed by Python (ver. 3.7.3). First, the absorbance values were subtracted from the value obtained from the well containing only the assay medium. Second, the subtracted values were normalized by the following equation: Y = (X-Low)/(High-Low) where Y is the normalized value, X is the experimental data, and High and Low are the highest and lowest values of the data obtained on the same day, respectively. For the cell viability assay in Fig. 2, the High and Low values were obtained from the maximum and minimum values on the same day, respectively. In Fig. 3, where the bulk population cell lines were used, the High and Low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. For the cell death assay, the High and Low values were taken from the value using Triton X-100 treated cells and the lowest values on the same day, respectively. Of note, the absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments, even though the number of cells was counted and the same number of cells were seeded between experiments. Therefore, the “High” and “Low” values were changeable. In addition, the LDH assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well. These factors and procedures would cause the large variation between experiments. The normalized values were used to generate maps using the seaborn library in Python (Figs. 2D, 3B, S1, S2 and S3). The normalized data were fitted with the following functions using the scipy.optimize.corve_fit in Python: WST(x)=(max-min)∗IC50n/(xn+IC50n)+min LDH(x)=(max-min)∗xn/(xn+EC50n)+min where WST(x) and LDH(x) are the fitted WST and LDH values, x is the sorbitol concentration, max and min are the maximum and minimum values, n is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 and EC50 are the half inhibitory concentration and half effective concentration for cell viability and cell death, respectively. Structure prediction by AlphaFold2 The predicted structures of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).

    "results": "Results and Discussion Hyperosmotic stress-induced changes in the subcellular localization of CAHS, LEAM, and MAHS proteins in HeLa cells We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins in R. varieornatus induced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis. Six types of proteins, including CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12, mitochondrial LEA (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS), were separately expressed as mEGFP-fused protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). We selected CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 because they reversibly form different types of aggregates in response to osmotic stimulation (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021), but their roles in osmotic stress resistance have not been investigated except for CAHS3 (Tanaka et al., 2022). The cells were loaded into a microfluidic chamber for rapid osmolyte solution perfusion. One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). Of note, NaCl is the principal determinant of tonicity of the extracellular fluid (Burg et al., 2007). However, cell membranes are permeable to Na+, and elevated chloride specifically increases the expression of α-Na+-K+-ATPase (Capasso et al., 2003). For this reason, poorly permeating organic solutes like sorbitol, mannitol, or raffinose are often used to produce hypertonicity (Burg et al., 2007). HeLa cells expressing mEGFP treated with the osmolytes showed increased fluorescence signal in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and puncta formation in the nucleus (Fig. 1C and Movie 1). These changes were reverted to the basal state by osmolyte washout (Fig. 1C). Under unstressed conditions, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were broadly distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CAHS3-mEGFP was mainly localized in the cytosol (Fig. 1D–G and Movies 2–5). When exposed to hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl, these CAHS proteins formed different aggregation patterns; CAHS1-mEGFP mainly forms granules and filamentous structures and slightly accumulates at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D and Movie 2). CAHS3-mEGFP shows fibrous structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E and Movie 3). CAHS8-mEGFP seems to have the same pattern as mEGFP, but it slightly accumulates at the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1F and Movie 4). CAHS12-mEGFP appears to undergo decomposition in the nucleus (Bracha et al., 2018), while it exhibits granules and filamentous structures (Fig. 1G and Movie 5). These results are, for the most part, consistent with previous reports (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021). Interestingly, CAHS proteins appear to behave differently between 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl osmotic stress. For example, CAHS1 did not aggregate at the cell membrane under 0.2 M NaCl stress, but showed strong aggregation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). CAHS12 also showed strong aggregation at the nuclear membrane and plasma membrane upon 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1G). Regardless of whether the aggregate forms granules or filaments during hyperosmotic stress, mEGFP and all CAHS protein condensates show rapid disassembly and restoration of coherent distribution upon the release of stress. It is reasonable to conclude that these rapid aggregation and disassembly processes are attributed to the biophysical properties of both mEGFP and each CAHS protein. Such efficient reversible phase transitioning mirrors the relatively fast induction and recovery of tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The varying modes of aggregation and localization patterns of different CAHS paralogs upon hyperosmotic stress suggest that these paralogs serve differentiated functions rather than for mere redundancy. Emerging tissue-specific expression patterns of tardigrade anhydrobiosis-related proteins (Tanaka et al., 2023) could be part of the reasons for such differentiation. It has been reported that two mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, LEAM and MAHS, in R. varieornatus improve the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells, possibly by acting as mitochondrial protectants (Tanaka et al., 2015). Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of LEAM and MAHS in HeLa cells stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. Under unstressed conditions, LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP were localized to the mitochondria, and LEAM-mEGFP was weakly distributed in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 1H and I). Hyperosmotic stress arrested the random movement of mitochondria, but did not substantially change the subcellular localization of LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP (Fig. 1H and I). Removal of osmolytes by replacement with an isosmotic medium resumed the thermal fluctuation of the mitochondria. Based on the fact that both LEAM and MAHS proteins localize to mitochondria and are highly hydrophilic (Tanaka et al., 2015), LEAM and MAHS are likely to be localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses. CAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells (Tanaka et al., 2022). However, the question remained as to whether other CAHS proteins, which exhibit varied aggregation patterns under elevated osmotic pressure, also contribute to augmented resistance to such conditions. To this end, we developed a method for quantitatively assessing osmotic stress resistance using HeLa cells expressing CAHS1 (Fig. 2A). We first established a single-cell clone of HeLa cells, expressing CAHS1-mEGFP in a manner dependent on doxycycline treatment. The experimental procedure was as follows: One day after cell seeding, doxycycline was added to induce CAHS1-mEGFP expression for two days, followed by different concentrations of sorbitol as osmolite. Cell viability and increased cell death were evaluated using the WST-1 and LDH assays, respectively (see Methods for details)(Fig. 2B). We first confirmed the increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression levels when we treated the cells with doxycycline (Fig. 2C). Despite performing single-cell cloning, the variation in the expression levels of CAHS1-mEGFP between cells was unexpectedly large. Under this condition, the cells were further exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Cell viability was strongly inhibited even in 0.1 M sorbitol in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2D, left, first row, and Fig. S1). The increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression attenuated the decrease in cell viability by hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol (Fig. 2D, left, and Fig. S1). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) increased depending on the CAHS1-mEGFP expression level (Fig. 2E, left). Parental HeLa cells as a negative control showed no change in cell viability with or without doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2E, right). In line with the cell viability assay, the number of hyperosmotic stress-induced cell death was also reduced by the expression of CAHS1-mEGFP (Fig. 2D, right, and Fig. S1). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) demonstrated a tendency to elevate with increasing expression of CAHS1-mEGFP (Fig. 2F, left). As a negative control, doxycycline treatment did not affect the EC50 values of sorbitol-induced cell death in parental HeLa cells (Fig. 2F, right). These results suggest that CAHS1 expression confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells. CAHS1-mEGFP localizes to aggregates and fibrous structures and even to the plasma membrane at high osmotic pressure (Fig. 1D), suggesting that CAHS1 exerts some protective function against osmotic stress at these sites. It should be noted that the time-scales of CAHS1 aggregation (~5 min) is much faster than the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death (~24 h) in response to hyperosmotic stress. This difference may explain the non-linear relationship between CAHS1 expression level (Fig. 2C) and the effects of sorbitol on cell viability (Fig. 2E) and cell death (Fig. 2F). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells (Fig. 2E and 2F). This may be because the single-cell clones established in this study happen to retain such properties. Further investigation would be needed in future studies to address this concern. Expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 confers osmotic stress resistance to HeLa cells We next examined the other CAHS proteins for their ability to confer osmotic stress tolerance to HeLa cells. To simplify the experiment, HeLa cell lines were established that express mEGFP, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Of note, these HeLa cell lines were bulk population cells, but not single-cell clones, because it takes longer time to establish the single-cell clones. First, we quantified the CAHS expression levels induced by doxycycline treatment in these HeLa cells, and found that doxycycline treatment elevated CAHS expression levels several-fold (Fig. 3A). The greater cellular heterogeneity compared to the single-cell cloned CAHS1-mEGFP cell line (Fig. 2C) may be because these cell lines are bulk population cells that have not been subjected to single-cell cloning. Second, we examined the changes in cell viability in these cell lines upon hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol using the WST-1 assay. The average cell viability of each cell line under conditions without and with doxycycline is shown in the heat map (Fig. 3B). Even before doxycycline treatment, cell viability was higher in cells expressing CAHS1-mEGFP and CAHS8-mEGFP, but not CAHS3-mEGFP and CAHS12-mEGFP, than in control mEGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3B, left). This may be because leakage of CAHS1 or CAHS8 proteins prior to doxycycline treatment contributes to tolerance to high osmotic pressure, while the expression levels of CAHS3 and CAHS12 did not reach the critical thresholds. In addition, doxycycline treatment rendered CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, or CAHS8-mEGFP expressing cells more resistant to higher concentrations of sorbitol than control mEGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3B, right). In our hand, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, or CAHS12-mEGFP expressing cells have rather increased cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol (Fig. 3B, right). At this time, we do not know whether this is a result of variability in our experiments or whether the CAHS proteins potentiate cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol. To quantitatively evaluate the resistance to hyperosmotic stress, we calculated the ratio of the IC50 value of cell viability against sorbitol after doxycycline treatment to that before doxycycline treatment. The IC50 values of CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, and CAHS8-mEGFP cells increased by 10–20% in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). No increase in the ratio of IC50 values was observed in mEGFP or CAHS12-mEGFP cells. Although the p-value (p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference was not statistically significant, the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation. The expression level of CAHS12 remained relatively low compared to CAHS3 and CAHS8, which had comparable expression levels before doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3A). We have previously shown that CAHS1 condensation displays concentration-dependent sigmoidal threshold-like behavior between 0.3–0.6 mM at neutral pH (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021); therefore, there still remains the possibility that the CAHS12 concentration did not exceed the critical threshold. Nevertheless, from these results, we conclude that overexpression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 moderately confers tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, and it is regardless of the mode of aggregation, whether granular or fibrous. Finally, we investigated the structure of the CAHS proteins in AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022), and found that CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 all share a single long α-helix and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini (Fig. 4); CAHS3 and CAHS12 have a predicted structure at the N-terminus, but their confidence is low. Despite the close structural similarity between CAHS proteins, the subcellular localization of these CAHS proteins under high osmotic pressure differed from each other (Fig. 1). As shown in the previous report, CAHS3 shows a coiled-coil structure and forms a fibrous structure, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and increasing the resistance to high osmotic pressure (Tanaka et al., 2022). We have demonstrated that CAHS1 and CAHS8 localize to granules, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane at high osmotic pressure (Fig. 1), suggesting that CAHS1 and CAHS8 may protect organelles such as plasma membrane and nuclear membrane from hyperosmotic stimuli. These diverse aggregation patterns of CAHS proteins may coordinate anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. Fig. 4.

    "conclusion": "Conclusion In this study, we expressed R. varieornatus CAHS proteins in HeLa cells to investigate their effects on resistance to hyperosmotic stress, an early step in anhydrobiosis. All of these proteins demonstrated reversible aggregation upon hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, exhibiting granular and filamentous structures (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we found that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 conferred resistance to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and 3). These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus, but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.",

Copyright notice ID: 11930778 PMID: 39566968 Abstract Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants. Keywords: anhydrobiosis, Tardigrades, live imaging, disordered proteins, desiccation toleranceIntroduction Anhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism (Crowe et al., 1998; Keilin, 1959). An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more (García, 2011; Hibshman et al., 2020; Leprince and Buitink, 2015). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Crowe et al., 1998; Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (Goyal et al., 2005; Kikawada et al., 2006; MacRae, 2016), heat shock proteins (Cornette et al., 2010; King and MacRae, 2015), and ROS scavenging (Gusev et al., 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance (Janis et al., 2018). Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state (Rebecchi et al., 2007; Wright, 2001). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuner et al., 2010; Rizzo et al., 2010; Schokraie et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2022), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat-soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed in Ramazzottius varieornatus, which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance without de novo gene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade, Hypsibius exemplaris, the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance (Arakawa, 2022; Kondo et al., 2015, 2019; Yoshida et al., 2017). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic predictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous structures in vitro and in cells (Malki et al., 2022; Tanaka et al., 2022; Veling et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, and Drosphila S2 cells (Boothby et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2022). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization of R. varieornatus CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress.Methods Plasmid construction All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1, along with Benchling links to the plasmid sequences and maps. Plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. The cDNAs of R. varieornatus CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, LEAM, and MAHS were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and inserted into the pCAGGS vector (Niwa et al., 1991) for transient expression experiments (Fig. 1) and the pT2A vector (pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE) for drug-inducible expression experiments (Fig. 2 and 3). Of note, since CAHS proteins are known to be abundantly expressed in tardigrades, we optimized the codon of the CAHS genes in order to express sufficient amounts of CAHS proteins in HeLa cells. The Tol2-based transposon donor vector (pT2A) and the Tol2 transposase expression vector (pCAGGS-T2TP) were kindly provided by Koichi Kawakami (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) (Kawakami and Noda, 2004). The cDNAs of rtTA (Roney et al., 2016) synthesized by FASMAC, tet-response element, and multiple cloning sites were inserted into a Tol2 donor vector by ligation and Gibson assembly to generate pTol2puro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS. The cDNAs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP), CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were subcloned into the pT2Apuro-rtTA2-TRE-MCS vector. Fig. 1.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) high glucose (#08458-45, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (#F7524, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Establishment of stable cell lines For transposon-mediated gene transfer, HeLa cells were transfected with Tol2 donor vectors and Tol2 transposase-expressing vectors in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 16–24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin (#ant-pr-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) for more than one week to select bulk cell lines. Cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin. In Fig. 2, the bright fluorescent cells were sorted into a 96-well plate using a cell sorter (MA900, SONY, Tokyo, Japan), and the single cell clone was used in Fig. 2. The bulk cell population was used in Fig. 3.Time-lapse imaging with hyperosmotic stress HeLa cells were seeded on a 35-mm dish (#150460, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) or a 6 well plate (#140675, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The plasmid expressing the CAHS1-mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTM Transfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were loaded onto a microfluidic plate (M04S-03-5PK, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The microfluidic plates were controlled by a CellASIC ONIX2 Microfluidic System (CAX2-S0000, Millipore). After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing FluoroBriteTM DMEM (#A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAXTM Supplement (#35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi (“psi” is a unit of pressure) while heating at 37°C by a temperature-controllable manifold (CAX2-MXT20, Millipore). For hyperosmotic shock experiments, 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution were prepared as follows: 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW and 5 M sodium chloride in DDW were dissolved by the imaging medium, resulting in 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution, respectively. The transfected cells seeded on microfluidic plates were time-lapse imaged under the imaging medium condition every 10 sec for 2 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 1 psi while heating at 37°C. Then, 0.5 M sorbitol solution or 0.2 M sodium chloride solution was added, and fluorescence images were acquired every 10 sec for 5 min. The hyperosmotic medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. After incubation, the hyperosmotic medium was replaced with the imaging medium, and the cells were observed every 10 sec for 10 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus/Evident, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Fusion BT, Hamamatsu photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-W1, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Musashino, Japan), and diode lasers at a wavelength of 488 nm. An oil immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO100XO, N.A. 1.45, Olympus/Evident) was used. The excitation laser and fluorescence filter settings were as follows: excitation laser, 488 nm; dichroic mirror (DM), 405/488/561 nm; and emission filters, 500–550 nm. During the observation, the cells were incubated with microfluidic plates at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). The background was subtracted by a constant value. If salt-and-pepper noise was not negligible, a median filter with 1-pixel was applied. To compensate for the misregistration caused during time-lapse imaging, the “StackReg function” was applied with the “Translation” option.Fluorescence imaging for quantifying expression levels HeLa cells carrying the doxycycline-inducible expression cassette of CAHS1, 3, 8, 12-mEGFP or mEGFP were seeded on a 96-well plate (#167008, Thermo Fisher Scientific). One day after seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of doxycycline, and 24 h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus/Evident) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 4000R, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), an excitation light source (Spectra-X light engine, Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), a laser-based autofocus system (IX2-ZDC, Olympus/Evident), a controller for filter wheels and XY stage (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), and an incubation chamber (STXG-IX3WX, Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan). An objective lens (UPlanApo 10x, N.A. 0.40, Olympus/Evident) was used. For EGFP imaging, a 475/28 excitation filter, a 20/80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT, Japan), and a 542/27 emission filter (Semrock, IDEX Health & Science, LLC, West Henrietta, NY, USA) were used. During the observation, live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified in Fiji/ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). The background was subtracted by the rolling ball method. The region of interest (ROI) of each cell was extracted with the “StarDistD2” function (Probability/Score Threshold: 0.55), and the fluorescence intensity (Mean value) of each ROI was obtained with the “Measure” function.Cell viability assay and cell death assay For the cell viability assay and the cell death assay, a low serum concentration medium (1% FBS), hereinafter referred to as the assay medium, was used to reduce the background absorbance in the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay because serum contains LDH. The assay medium contains 1x DME culture solution (#639-29631, Nitta Gelatin, Yao, Japan), 1% FBS, 26 mM NaHCO3 (#09655-25, Nacalai Tesque), and 1 μg/mL puromycin (if needed). For hyperosmotic stress, a 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was prepared by mixing 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW, 5x DME culture solution, 260 mM NaHCO3, 100% FBS, DDW, and 1 mg/mL puromycin. This 3.2 M sorbitol solution in the assay medium was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of sorbitol solution. For drug-inducible gene expression, 1 mg/mL doxycycline (#D4116, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) was serially diluted with the assay medium to produce the indicated concentration of doxycycline solution in the assay medium. HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102 – 3.0 × 103 cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay (Fig. 2), half of the cell supernatant was used for the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay with a Premix WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay System (#MK400, TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401, TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both the WST-1 and LDH release assays were evaluated based on absorbance at 450 nm (and 620 nm as a control) using a microplate reader (#51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The absorbance values obtained from the microplate reader were exported and analyzed by Python (ver. 3.7.3). First, the absorbance values were subtracted from the value obtained from the well containing only the assay medium. Second, the subtracted values were normalized by the following equation: Y = (X-Low)/(High-Low) where Y is the normalized value, X is the experimental data, and High and Low are the highest and lowest values of the data obtained on the same day, respectively. For the cell viability assay in Fig. 2, the High and Low values were obtained from the maximum and minimum values on the same day, respectively. In Fig. 3, where the bulk population cell lines were used, the High and Low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. For the cell death assay, the High and Low values were taken from the value using Triton X-100 treated cells and the lowest values on the same day, respectively. Of note, the absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments, even though the number of cells was counted and the same number of cells were seeded between experiments. Therefore, the “High” and “Low” values were changeable. In addition, the LDH assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well. These factors and procedures would cause the large variation between experiments. The normalized values were used to generate maps using the seaborn library in Python (Figs. 2D, 3B, S1, S2 and S3). The normalized data were fitted with the following functions using the scipy.optimize.corve_fit in Python: WST(x)=(max-min)∗IC50n/(xn+IC50n)+min LDH(x)=(max-min)∗xn/(xn+EC50n)+min where WST(x) and LDH(x) are the fitted WST and LDH values, x is the sorbitol concentration, max and min are the maximum and minimum values, n is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 and EC50 are the half inhibitory concentration and half effective concentration for cell viability and cell death, respectively.Structure prediction by AlphaFold2 The predicted structures of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). Direct links are as follows: CAHS1 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M799), CAHS3 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M3T1), CAHS8 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1UQN2), and CAHS12 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1VNN8).Results and Discussion Hyperosmotic stress-induced changes in the subcellular localization of CAHS, LEAM, and MAHS proteins in HeLa cells We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins in R. varieornatus induced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis. Six types of proteins, including CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12, mitochondrial LEA (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS), were separately expressed as mEGFP-fused protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). We selected CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 because they reversibly form different types of aggregates in response to osmotic stimulation (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021), but their roles in osmotic stress resistance have not been investigated except for CAHS3 (Tanaka et al., 2022). The cells were loaded into a microfluidic chamber for rapid osmolyte solution perfusion. One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). Of note, NaCl is the principal determinant of tonicity of the extracellular fluid (Burg et al., 2007). However, cell membranes are permeable to Na+, and elevated chloride specifically increases the expression of α-Na+-K+-ATPase (Capasso et al., 2003). For this reason, poorly permeating organic solutes like sorbitol, mannitol, or raffinose are often used to produce hypertonicity (Burg et al., 2007). HeLa cells expressing mEGFP treated with the osmolytes showed increased fluorescence signal in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and puncta formation in the nucleus (Fig. 1C and Movie 1). These changes were reverted to the basal state by osmolyte washout (Fig. 1C). Under unstressed conditions, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP were broadly distributed in both the cytosol and nucleus, whereas CAHS3-mEGFP was mainly localized in the cytosol (Fig. 1D–G and Movies 2–5). When exposed to hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl, these CAHS proteins formed different aggregation patterns; CAHS1-mEGFP mainly forms granules and filamentous structures and slightly accumulates at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D and Movie 2). CAHS3-mEGFP shows fibrous structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E and Movie 3). CAHS8-mEGFP seems to have the same pattern as mEGFP, but it slightly accumulates at the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1F and Movie 4). CAHS12-mEGFP appears to undergo decomposition in the nucleus (Bracha et al., 2018), while it exhibits granules and filamentous structures (Fig. 1G and Movie 5). These results are, for the most part, consistent with previous reports (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021). Interestingly, CAHS proteins appear to behave differently between 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl osmotic stress. For example, CAHS1 did not aggregate at the cell membrane under 0.2 M NaCl stress, but showed strong aggregation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). CAHS12 also showed strong aggregation at the nuclear membrane and plasma membrane upon 0.5 M sorbitol and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively (Fig. 1G). Regardless of whether the aggregate forms granules or filaments during hyperosmotic stress, mEGFP and all CAHS protein condensates show rapid disassembly and restoration of coherent distribution upon the release of stress. It is reasonable to conclude that these rapid aggregation and disassembly processes are attributed to the biophysical properties of both mEGFP and each CAHS protein. Such efficient reversible phase transitioning mirrors the relatively fast induction and recovery of tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The varying modes of aggregation and localization patterns of different CAHS paralogs upon hyperosmotic stress suggest that these paralogs serve differentiated functions rather than for mere redundancy. Emerging tissue-specific expression patterns of tardigrade anhydrobiosis-related proteins (Tanaka et al., 2023) could be part of the reasons for such differentiation. It has been reported that two mitochondrial heat-soluble proteins, LEAM and MAHS, in R. varieornatus improve the hyperosmotic tolerance of human cells, possibly by acting as mitochondrial protectants (Tanaka et al., 2015). Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of LEAM and MAHS in HeLa cells stimulated by hyperosmotic stress. Under unstressed conditions, LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP were localized to the mitochondria, and LEAM-mEGFP was weakly distributed in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 1H and I). Hyperosmotic stress arrested the random movement of mitochondria, but did not substantially change the subcellular localization of LEAM-mEGFP and MAHS-mEGFP (Fig. 1H and I). Removal of osmolytes by replacement with an isosmotic medium resumed the thermal fluctuation of the mitochondria. Based on the fact that both LEAM and MAHS proteins localize to mitochondria and are highly hydrophilic (Tanaka et al., 2015), LEAM and MAHS are likely to be localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Taken together, these results suggest that the resistance to hyperosmotic stress by LEAM and MAHS expression is not cell-wide protection as observed for CAHS proteins, so we focused on the CAHS proteins for our subsequent analyses.CAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells (Tanaka et al., 2022). However, the question remained as to whether other CAHS proteins, which exhibit varied aggregation patterns under elevated osmotic pressure, also contribute to augmented resistance to such conditions. To this end, we developed a method for quantitatively assessing osmotic stress resistance using HeLa cells expressing CAHS1 (Fig. 2A). We first established a single-cell clone of HeLa cells, expressing CAHS1-mEGFP in a manner dependent on doxycycline treatment. The experimental procedure was as follows: One day after cell seeding, doxycycline was added to induce CAHS1-mEGFP expression for two days, followed by different concentrations of sorbitol as osmolite. Cell viability and increased cell death were evaluated using the WST-1 and LDH assays, respectively (see Methods for details)(Fig. 2B). We first confirmed the increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression levels when we treated the cells with doxycycline (Fig. 2C). Despite performing single-cell cloning, the variation in the expression levels of CAHS1-mEGFP between cells was unexpectedly large. Under this condition, the cells were further exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Cell viability was strongly inhibited even in 0.1 M sorbitol in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2D, left, first row, and Fig. S1). The increase in CAHS1-mEGFP expression attenuated the decrease in cell viability by hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol (Fig. 2D, left, and Fig. S1). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) increased depending on the CAHS1-mEGFP expression level (Fig. 2E, left). Parental HeLa cells as a negative control showed no change in cell viability with or without doxycycline treatment (Fig. 2E, right). In line with the cell viability assay, the number of hyperosmotic stress-induced cell death was also reduced by the expression of CAHS1-mEGFP (Fig. 2D, right, and Fig. S1). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) demonstrated a tendency to elevate with increasing expression of CAHS1-mEGFP (Fig. 2F, left). As a negative control, doxycycline treatment did not affect the EC50 values of sorbitol-induced cell death in parental HeLa cells (Fig. 2F, right). These results suggest that CAHS1 expression confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells. CAHS1-mEGFP localizes to aggregates and fibrous structures and even to the plasma membrane at high osmotic pressure (Fig. 1D), suggesting that CAHS1 exerts some protective function against osmotic stress at these sites. It should be noted that the time-scales of CAHS1 aggregation (~5 min) is much faster than the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death (~24 h) in response to hyperosmotic stress. This difference may explain the non-linear relationship between CAHS1 expression level (Fig. 2C) and the effects of sorbitol on cell viability (Fig. 2E) and cell death (Fig. 2F). In addition, in this study, the single-cell clone of HeLa cells stably expressing CAHS1-mEGFP indicated lower IC50 values for cell viability and EC50 values for cell death in response to sorbitol stimulation in the absence of doxycycline than parental HeLa cells (Fig. 2E and 2F). This may be because the single-cell clones established in this study happen to retain such properties. Further investigation would be needed in future studies to address this concern.Expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 confers osmotic stress resistance to HeLa cells We next examined the other CAHS proteins for their ability to confer osmotic stress tolerance to HeLa cells. To simplify the experiment, HeLa cell lines were established that express mEGFP, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, and CAHS12-mEGFP in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Of note, these HeLa cell lines were bulk population cells, but not single-cell clones, because it takes longer time to establish the single-cell clones. First, we quantified the CAHS expression levels induced by doxycycline treatment in these HeLa cells, and found that doxycycline treatment elevated CAHS expression levels several-fold (Fig. 3A). The greater cellular heterogeneity compared to the single-cell cloned CAHS1-mEGFP cell line (Fig. 2C) may be because these cell lines are bulk population cells that have not been subjected to single-cell cloning. Second, we examined the changes in cell viability in these cell lines upon hyperosmotic stress with sorbitol using the WST-1 assay. The average cell viability of each cell line under conditions without and with doxycycline is shown in the heat map (Fig. 3B). Even before doxycycline treatment, cell viability was higher in cells expressing CAHS1-mEGFP and CAHS8-mEGFP, but not CAHS3-mEGFP and CAHS12-mEGFP, than in control mEGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3B, left). This may be because leakage of CAHS1 or CAHS8 proteins prior to doxycycline treatment contributes to tolerance to high osmotic pressure, while the expression levels of CAHS3 and CAHS12 did not reach the critical thresholds. In addition, doxycycline treatment rendered CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, or CAHS8-mEGFP expressing cells more resistant to higher concentrations of sorbitol than control mEGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3B, right). In our hand, CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, CAHS8-mEGFP, or CAHS12-mEGFP expressing cells have rather increased cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol (Fig. 3B, right). At this time, we do not know whether this is a result of variability in our experiments or whether the CAHS proteins potentiate cell viability under low concentrations of sorbitol. To quantitatively evaluate the resistance to hyperosmotic stress, we calculated the ratio of the IC50 value of cell viability against sorbitol after doxycycline treatment to that before doxycycline treatment. The IC50 values of CAHS1-mEGFP, CAHS3-mEGFP, and CAHS8-mEGFP cells increased by 10–20% in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). No increase in the ratio of IC50 values was observed in mEGFP or CAHS12-mEGFP cells. Although the p-value (p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference was not statistically significant, the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation. The expression level of CAHS12 remained relatively low compared to CAHS3 and CAHS8, which had comparable expression levels before doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3A). We have previously shown that CAHS1 condensation displays concentration-dependent sigmoidal threshold-like behavior between 0.3–0.6 mM at neutral pH (Tanaka et al., 2022; Yagi-Utsumi et al., 2021); therefore, there still remains the possibility that the CAHS12 concentration did not exceed the critical threshold. Nevertheless, from these results, we conclude that overexpression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 moderately confers tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, and it is regardless of the mode of aggregation, whether granular or fibrous. Finally, we investigated the structure of the CAHS proteins in AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021; Varadi et al., 2022), and found that CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 all share a single long α-helix and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini (Fig. 4); CAHS3 and CAHS12 have a predicted structure at the N-terminus, but their confidence is low. Despite the close structural similarity between CAHS proteins, the subcellular localization of these CAHS proteins under high osmotic pressure differed from each other (Fig. 1). As shown in the previous report, CAHS3 shows a coiled-coil structure and forms a fibrous structure, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and increasing the resistance to high osmotic pressure (Tanaka et al., 2022). We have demonstrated that CAHS1 and CAHS8 localize to granules, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane at high osmotic pressure (Fig. 1), suggesting that CAHS1 and CAHS8 may protect organelles such as plasma membrane and nuclear membrane from hyperosmotic stimuli. These diverse aggregation patterns of CAHS proteins may coordinate anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab The predicted structure of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 The predicted structure of CAHS1 (A), CAHS3 (B), CAHS8 (C), and CAHS12 (D) by AlphaFold2 are shown.

All of these proteins demonstrated reversible aggregation upon hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells, exhibiting granular and filamentous structures (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we found that expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 conferred resistance to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic stress in HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and 3). These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus, but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.Fundings This work was financially supported in part by grants from the MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (22H02625 and 24H01416) to K.

    "title": "Production of reactive oxygen species and involvement of bioprotectants during anhydrobiosis in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.

    "introduction": "Introduction Insufficient hydration is extremely stressful for living organisms as water is required for metabolic reactions. Nevertheless, some animals living in habitats subject to periodic or unpredictable desiccation periods have evolved a remarkable adaptive strategy called anhydrobiosis. This physiological state allows for the nearly complete dehydration of the animal’s body and cells, a reduced or suspended metabolism leading to a temporary suspension of active life processes, and finally a developmental standstill as a direct response to the desiccation of the surrounding habitat of the animals1–4. This state is reversed by the reappearance of environmental water, with the restoring of metabolism and of all features of active life, even after the permanence in a desiccated state for months to decades1,2,4–6. However, anhydrobiosis, as well as the time spent in a desiccated state, can still cause cellular damages, including membrane destabilization, protein and nucleic acid denaturation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress with the eventual death of organisms7–16. To withstand stress caused by the drastic loss of body water, many anhydrobiotic animals first slow the rate of their dehydration by modifying their body in a compact structure that reduces the surface area, and consequently the evaporation rate17–19. Simultaneously, they undergo biochemical changes associated with the synthesis of molecules working as bioprotectants, which replace cellular water or stabilize cellular machinery13,20–27. To gain insights into anhydrobiosis and what bioprotectants help to mediate this phenomenon, tardigrades are an attractive model. Tardigrades are hygrophilous animals that need to be surrounded by a film of water to perform active life. As a consequence, their capability to colonise terrestrial environments (e.g. moss, lichen, soil, and leaf litter) is linked to their well-known ability to enter anhydrobiosis at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult28. As their surroundings lose water, tardigrades lose most (> 95%) of their free and bound body water and suspend their metabolism3. The loss of water is accompanied by the invagination of the intersegmental cuticle and by the retraction of the head and legs, resulting in a compact tun-shaped body3,29,30. Anhydrobiotic (desiccated) tardigrades can withstand several physical and chemical extremes (e.g. very low and high temperature, high pressure, vacuum, organic solvents and radiations) that are far more extreme than that imposed by their natural habitats, including space conditions3,25,26,31–36. As well as in other anhydrobiotic animals, the desiccation in tardigrades is accomplished through morphological changes (tun) together with the synthesis of different bioprotectants20–22,24–27. These molecules include, for example, osmolytes, trehalose, antioxidants, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Aquaporin Proteins (AQPs) and Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), including the Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins (LEA)13,20–22,24–27. Trehalose, a disaccharide with high ability for water-replacement during dehydration, immobilising macromolecules and stabilizing cellular structure through vitrification has long been implicated in desiccation tolerance20,26,37. The presence and the amount of trehalose detected in tardigrades are different from species to species27, but is much lower than the one recorded in other anhydrobiotic animals that use trehalose as mechanism to reduce damages induced by desiccation1,38–40. Therefore, the degree of involvement of trehalose as a protective molecule in anhydrobiotic tardigrades is still debated27. Antioxidants, such as scavenging enzymes, limit oxidative stress, which appears to be one of the most deleterious damages associated with desiccation9. The depletion of water changes the ionic concentration of anhydrobiotic organisms, including tardigrades41, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)9,11,42,43, consisting in free radicals [e.g. superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH·), perhydroxy radical (HO2·)] and non-radical forms [e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2)]44. Water loss therefore increases the susceptibility of biomolecules to the attack of reactive oxygen molecules, damaging proteins, membranes, and DNA9,11,13,22,27,42,43. Since aquaporins contribute to water transport through plasma membranes, some researchers have suggested that they play some role in anhydrobiosis, hypothesizing their involvement in the regulation of water loss to fine tune desiccation kinetics11,23,45–47. However, it remains unclear if aquaporins function in preparing anhydrobiotic animals for desiccation or play a role in rehydration. In this paper, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis Guidetti et al., 2019 was selected as a model organism (Fig. 1) in light of its robust ability to survive desiccation10,48. To understand what bioprotectants might be involved in mitigating the stresses imposed by desiccation, we first sought to identify exactly what those stresses are. As mentioned above, water loss can lead to the generation of deleterious ROS, however this has never been directly tested before in tardigrades. To verify whether desiccation induces production of ROS in tardigrades, we analysed the ROS production in the coelomocytes (storage cells; Fig. 1c). Coelomocytes are round free-floating cells in the body cavity of tardigrades which act as reservoirs and transporters of lipids and glycogen49–52. The number of storage cells in a tardigrade specimen is in the range of a few hundred up to more than 1000 cells according to the species4,52,53, while their size changes along with animal life cycle including oocyte developmental in females54. Contrasting data are reported about the decline in size and number of storage cells after a period of anhydrobiosis in tardigrade species51–53. A decline in size of storage cells is due to the use of stored material as energy requirements to enter and exit anhydrobiosis51. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Paramacrobiotus spatialis.

Next, we investigated possible roles for endogenous protectants, such as antioxidant enzymes, aquaporin proteins and the sugar trehalose, in desiccation tolerance. Genes encoding five antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase), for two aquaporins (aquaporins 3 and 10) and for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were thus targeted using RNA interference (RNAi), and later the successful recover of P. spatialis specimens after desiccation was verified.",
    "methods": "Methods Collection of the target species The eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis Guidetti et al. 2019 was used as target species. Specimens were collected from hazel-leaf litter at Formigine (80 m a.s.l.; 44° 34.253′ N, 10° 50.892′ E, Modena, Northern Italy). Leaf litter was immersed in tap water and then animals were extracted from their substrate by means of sieves, picked up with a glass pipette under a stereomicroscope and stored in tap water and natural mineral water 1:1 (rearing water) at 16 °C for 24 h before their use10,31. Experimental desiccation and rehydration of tardigrades Animals were desiccated using a climate chamber (CHL, Angelantoni Industrie, Milan, Italy) that allows to control air temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the air. Animals were placed on a blot filter paper with a drop of rearing water and kept at 18 °C and 80% RH for 4 h, then to 50% RH for 4 h, and finally at 20 °C and 0–3% RH overnight41. At the end of these steps, the tardigrade body has the typical compact tun shape structure of a desiccated/anhydrobiotic tardigrade (Fig. 1d). To rehydrate desiccated tardigrades, small amounts of rearing water were slowly added on each filter paper every 10 min for a total of 60 min, this rehydration step is here termed the “rehydration process”. Rehydrated tardigrades were maintained at 16 °C and observed under a stereomicroscope. Coordinated and active movements of the body (locomotion performance) constituted the criterion to evaluate tardigrade motility (survival). Locomotion performance was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1 h (t1) and 24 h (t24) (see Altiero et al.34). Detection of reactive oxygen species production under desiccation The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was detected after specimens of P. spatialis were kept in a desiccated state for 1 and 20 days (see above protocol) at 16 °C and 0–3% RH. In particular, ROS production was evaluated in coelomocytes (storage cells) 3 and 12 h after the rehydration process. As control, specimens kept in rearing water were used. For each experimental conditions and controls, 2–5 animals were used, and for each animal 6–45 singular storage cells randomly chosen were analysed (Table S1). The fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA) diluted in methanol was used. It is the most common probe to detect overall level of intracellular ROS55,56. Preliminary tests evidenced that tardigrades survive when kept for 45 min in methanol used for dilution (methanol: distilled water, 1:10). Each tardigrade was sonicated for 90 s in rearing water to allow the entrance of the probe in the tardigrade, and then incubated in 1 ml of 10 µM DCFH2-DA in methanol for 45 min at 20 °C in the dark. After these steps, each tardigrade was washed with rearing water, mounted on a slide with rearing water as mounting medium. Then, the animal was gently broken with a pressure on cover slip to obtain the release of isolated storage cells. Cells were observed using Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal scanner microscope mounted on a Leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope, with an Ar excitation laser (λexc = 488 nm) for DCFH2-DA (λem = 543 nm) available at Centro Interdipartimentale Grandi Strumenti (CIGS) of University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The ROS signal was measured quantifying the intensity of the fluorescence signal of each storage cell using the program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The fluorescence intensity of storage cells was standardised removing the storage cell size effect and the background signal. The following formula was used: Intensity of the storage cell signal = total fluorescence intensity of storage cell - [(x/y)·z]. In which: x = mean of two areas of the fluorescence intensity, y = mean of two background areas, z = storage cell area. The mean value of fluorescence intensity of all previously measured storage cells was considered for each experimental condition (Table S2). The statistical comparisons of ROS signals among the different experimental groups and controls were evaluated through the analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) with a Tukey post-hoc test, using the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA). Targeting of genes potentially involved in desiccation tolerance The RNA interference technique was utilised to target eight tardigrade genes. The genes gpx, gr, gst, cat, sod and tps (encoding the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, respectively), and aqp 3 and aqp 10 (encoding the membrane channel aquaporin proteins 3 and 10) were targeted in order to disrupt their function. To verify the involvement of these target genes in the desiccation tolerance of P. spatialis, three groups of animals were used: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. control animals injected with RNase free water (control 2); 3. injected animals with the dsRNA of a target gene (experimental group). For each target gene, three replicates each of 10 P. spatialis specimens (experimental group) were used. Each animal was injected with the dsRNA of a single target gene at the concentration of 4 µg/µl (see paragraph below). For both control groups, three replicates each of 10 animals were used. The methodological steps applied to animals were: injection (except for control 1), desiccation, rehydration, and check of animal motility. The injection was performed following the protocol by Tenlen et al.57 with slight modifications. In particular, injection needles were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries 1B100F-4 (Word Precision Instruments, Inc.) using a PC-10 Puller (Narishige). Injection slides were prepared as indicated by Tenlen et al.57. Injections of the animals were performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and a manual micromanipulator (Leitz Wetzlar) linked to a Hamilton Microliter™ syringe. Needle tips were broken by gently stroking the tips against the edge of a triangular coverslip piece to obtain an opening in the needle tip of 2–3 µm in diameter. The successful injection of dsRNA or RNAfree water into the body cavity of tardigrades was confirmed by the swelling of the body as indicated by Tenlen et al.57. All injected tardigrades were transferred in rearing water and left overnight to allow the dsRNA to disrupt the gene function, as indicated by Boothby et al.24. Therefore, they were individually desiccated as described above, kept desiccated for 2 days, and rehydrated using the protocol described above. Tardigrade motility was recorded using the criterion of locomotion performance, which was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1 h (t1), 24 h (t24) and 48 h (t48). The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare the percentage of motile tardigrades (with locomotion performance) injected with dsRNA with respect to those of controls 1 and 2 at t0, t1, t24 and t48. The tps gene was chosen as a further control (Control 3) to exclude the possibility that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is harmful for P. spatialis, since animals targeted for this gene exhibited negligible effects on the motilities at every time of rehydration. The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare the motility percentages of tardigrades injected with tps dsRNA with respect to those of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes at t0, t1, t24 and t48. The statistical analysis was performed with the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Synthesis of specific target gene dsRNA The transcriptome of P. spatialis24,86 was compared with the transcriptome of the eutardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris Gąsiorek, Stec, Morek & Michalczyk, 201824 and with sequences of the nematode C. elegans Maupas, 190087 contained in WormBase and GenBank. Obtained sequences were aligned using the program BLAST to design gene-specific primers (Table S4). Genomic DNA was extracted from five specimens of P. spatialis using the Worm Lysis Buffer57. Gene-specific primers (Table S4) were used to amplify the target sequence with these cycles: first denaturation step for 2 min at 95 °C, at least 15 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at 70 °C for 1 min with a decreasing rate of 1 °C/cycle until the melting temperature (Tm; Table S4) of the tested primers is reached, 2 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at Tm of the tested primers for 1 min, and 2 min at 72 °C, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products of each target gene were directly inserted into a plasmid vector (pCR™ -Blunt II-TOPO® vector) and cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher). The recombinant vector was then used to transform competent Mach1™ T1R cells of Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher). To verify if the target gene has been inserted in the vector, a PCR reaction was performed using the purified plasmid DNA as a template and gene-specific primers, with this cycle: 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 30 s min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. After successful control of the amplification, several clones were sequenced for each gene, using gene-specific primers. After sequencing, the plasmid sequence was aligned with the target gene sequence using the program BLAST to check the real insertion of the target gene in the plasmid and the absence of introns in the sequence. New primers were designed by adding the sequence of promoter T7 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) to the 5′ portion of each original gene specific primer sequence (Table S4) and they were used to synthesize dsRNA from the P. spatialis genomic DNA, using the T7 RiboMAX™ Express RNAi System (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following ethanol precipitation, dsRNA of each target gene was resuspended in nuclease-free water and was ready to be used in RNAi. The targeted genes and their sequence references are reported in Table S2. The list of targeted sequences is reported in the supplementary section. Protocol to verify the successful targeting of genes by RNAi A protocol was designed to verify if RNAi led to a decrease of each target gene expression level. A new group of five specimens of P. spatialis were injected with each target gene specific dsRNA, then individually desiccated, and rehydrated following the protocols described above. At t0 (after the rehydration process), total RNA was extracted from each animal using the MasterPure Kit (Epicentre), and then used to synthesise cDNA using the SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, each target gene was amplified using the specific primers designed on P. spatialis transcriptome (Table S4) and applying the same thermal cycling conditions described above. As a PCR control, the same RNA extracted from each individual tardigrade was used to amplify the DNA polymerase II, which was used as control gene (accession number: GFGY01000030; position: 7492–7959; length: 468 bp; targeted sequence in supplementary section). For this gene, specific designed primers (F- 5′-GTC ACG GAC GAA GGA GAA TTT A-3′; R- 5′-ACG TGA AGA TGG GCG TAT TG-3′) were used.",
    "results": "Results Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in anhydrobiosis The overall level of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was assessed using the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA)55,56. The ROS production in anhydrobiosis was determined measuring the intensity of the fluorescent signal emitted by storage cells of the desiccation tolerant tardigrade P. spatialis. Storage cells are particularly useful as they are numerous as well as the only cell type within the tardigrade body cavity. Storage cells are also easy to obtain and manipulate, whereas other tissues in tardigrades are more difficult to obtain and work with (Fig. 1c,d). Figure 2 shows the fluorescence signals detected respectively 3 h and 12 h after the rehydration process in tardigrade storage cells previously kept in a desiccated state for 1 day and 20 days, and in the animals kept in a hydrated state as control.

The storage cells of desiccated animals always emitted an intense fluorescence signal, while those of control ones emitted a faint spotted fluorescence signal (Fig. 2). The intensity of the fluorescence signal emitted by the storage cells of desiccated animals was always significantly higher than the fluorescence intensity detected in cells of control animals (Fig. 2; Table 1; one-way ANOVA: n = 485; p < 0.001). Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence signal was at its highest level in the coelomocytes of animals kept desiccated for 20 days, while the lowest signal was recorded in cells of tardigrades kept desiccated for 1 day (Fig. 2; Table 1). Disruption of target genes function RNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the function of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in desiccation tolerance in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis. RNAi has previously been characterized in tardigrades and is known to target specific gene products for destruction both in adults during desiccation and in embryos during development24,57. Similarly, it has been shown that large amounts of non-specific dsRNA (e.g. double stranded RNA targeting GFP) do not affect tardigrade survival24 nor embryo viability and development57. In this study, the eight genes targeted by RNAi were: gpx, gr, gst, cat and sod, encoding for enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) that counteract reactive oxygen species; tps, encoding for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, involved in the pathways of trehalose production; aqp 3 and aqp 10, encoding for aquaporin proteins 3 and 10, which are presumably involved in the rapid transport of water through cell membranes. The involvement of these target genes was verified by comparing the motilities of P. spatialis animals that have exited tun belonging to three groups: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. injected with RNase free water control animals (control 2); 3. injected animals with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the target gene (experimental group). The motility of the animals after a period of anhydrobiosis was evaluated by monitoring locomotion performance (i.e. coordinate movements of the body) immediately after the rehydration process (t0), 1 h (t1), 24 h (t24), and 48 h (t48) later. Additionally, five specimens of P. spatialis were individually injected with dsRNA of each target gene, desiccated, and then rehydrated. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a marked decrease in the expression level of each target gene in comparison to DNA polymerase II (DNA pol II) used as a control gene (Fig. S1), indicating that RNA interference led to a decrease in the targeted gene’s expression level. The assessment of motility in both control 1 (uninjected) and control 2 (water injected) animals always resulted 100% (Fig. 3a,b), since all animals are alive at each time point assayed after the rehydration process. These data demonstrate that the desiccation protocol was suitable for P. spatialis, and that the injection alone does not affect survival of the tardigrades during anhydrobiosis. On the other hand, significant differences were recorded between the motility percentages of both controls and most experimental groups (Fig. 3; Kruskal–Wallis test: number of pairwise comparisons = 132; p < 0.001). For treatments targeting antioxidant enzymes, specimens injected with dsRNA of gpx showed significantly lower motilities with respect to both types of controls at every time after the rehydration process (t0: p < 0.001; t1: p < 0.01; t24: p < 0.01; t48: p < 0.01; Fig. 3c). In animals injected with dsRNA for genes of gr, cat and sod, significant differences with respect to both types of controls were only observed between the percentages of animal motilities recorded at t0 (immediately after the rehydration process) (gr: p < 0.01; cat: p < 0.01; sod: p < 0.01; Fig. 3d,f,g). Significant differences in the motility percentages with respect to both types of controls were also evidenced at t0, t1 and t24 in animals injected with dsRNA of aqp 3 (t0: p < 0.01, t1: p < 0.05; t24: p < 0.05; Fig. 3i) and at t0, t1 and t24 in animals injected with dsRNA of aqp 10 (t0: p < 0.001, t24: p < 0.01; t48: p < 0.01; Fig. 3j).The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of the gst and tps genes did not show significant differences with respect to both types of controls (uninjected and water injected) at every time after the rehydration process (Fig. 3e,h). Since RNAi knockdown of the tps gene resulted in negligible effects on the animal motilities at all times following rehydration, and since the tps dsRNA was the largest used in our study (Table S2), we consider this gene as a further control (control 3), and further evidences that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is not harmful for P. spatialis. The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA targeting the tps gene compared with the motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes shows significant differences (Table S3). These statistical differences are consistent with the scored significances of comparisons between controls (non-injected and water injected) and target genes, except for motility at t0 of animals injected with sod dsRNA, motilities at t1 and t24 of animals targeted for aqp 3 and motilities at t24 and t48 of animals targeted for aqp 10 (Fig. 3; Table S3). Therefore, only for these exceptions is it possible to presume an effect on P. spatialis motilities was due to injection of large dsRNA. Figure 3.

    "discussion": "Discussion This study provides an evaluation of oxidative stress production during desiccation in tardigrades through the direct assessment of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in storage cells. In addition, this study assesses the degree of involvement of various bioprotectants in anhydrobiotic survival of tardigrades using RNA interference to perturb gene functions in Paramacrobiotus spatialis. Storage cells are singular free-floating cells accumulating polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins49,50,58. The faint spotted fluorescence emitted by the storage cells of the control specimens of P. spatialis denotes that in metabolically active animals there is a regular, but small, production of ROS due to the standard metabolic reactions. This has been reported in all living organisms, not only related to anhydrobiosis (see França et al.9; Kranner & Birtić43; Boveris & Chance59). The storage cells of desiccated specimens of P. spatialis emitted an intense fluorescence, demonstrating that anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production and consequently of oxidative stress. Previous reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals22,46, or by evaluating the ROS-damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period60. Evidence of the production of free radicals (and consequently of oxidative stress) in anhydrobiosis has been found in other organisms, such as cyanobacteria (see Potts61), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see Pereira et al.62), intertidal seaweeds (see Flores-Molina et al.63), the moss Fontinalis antipyretica (see Cruz de Carvalho et al.64) and the shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicas (see Duan et al.65). In tardigrades, ROS production occurs both during desiccation, and while in a desiccated state. These data can explain the increase in mortality and/or in a long recovery time (i.e. time to recover active life after desiccation) measured in P. spatialis specimens after extended periods in a desiccated state10. These two phenomena are directly proportional to the time spent in a desiccated state, since molecular damages are accumulated with time because metabolism is arrested, and repair systems are not working10. Oxidative stress leads to a long recovery time and to the death of tardigrades since the animals need more time to repair oxidation damages. The glutathione pathway, including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase, is an important antioxidant system involved in the scavenging of ROS13. In this pathway, the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase act by removing hydrogen peroxide, while the glutathione reductase reduces the glutathione disulphide to glutathione9,43. Targeting a gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which is induced by desiccation, compromised survival during desiccation, providing evidence for this gene’s role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance. Targeting of gpx by RNAi in the tardigrade P. spatialis resulted in a significant lower percentage of tardigrades with motility (i.e. lower survival) at every time after the rehydration process with respect to control animals kept hydrated and metabolically active (Controls 1 and 2) and with respect to animals targeted for tps (non-effective gene, Control 3). The effects on the percent motility observed in animals injected with dsRNA of gpx are enhanced by the presence of low copies of this gene in tardigrades25. A similar pattern was obtained with the knockdown of glutathione peroxidase transcripts by RNAi in the nematode Panagrolaimus superbus, which led to a decrease survival post-desiccation66. The glutathione peroxidase enzyme has a crucial role during anhydrobiosis of P. spatialis, since animals targeted for gpx do not recover their motility indicating that other antioxidant enzymes or other endogenous molecules cannot fully replace essential roles of glutathione peroxidase. The important role of this molecule in desiccation tolerance of P. spatialis extend the previous results of Rizzo et al.22, where glutathione peroxidase was one of the enzymes with the higher enzymatic activity. This enzyme is utilised to counteract ROS not only during the dehydration process, but also probably plays a vital role during the rehydration phase22 and thus the enzyme encoded by gpx is essential for tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The crucial role of glutathione peroxidase in tardigrades is in line with its role in counteracting oxidative stress caused by desiccation in other organisms: e.g. in transgenic tobacco plants67, in the larvae of the midge P. vanderplanki11, in the dauer larvae of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans68, and other species of nematodes66,69,70. The targeting of glutathione transferase (gst) had no effects on the motilities of injected animals at any time following rehydration. GSTs have been seen to exist in high copy number in several tardigrade species25,71, implying that P. spatialis may also have a high copy number of these genes. If this is the case, the knockdown of a single putative gene of gst might not be sufficient to perturb anhydrobiosis in this species. The data obtained on P. spatialis specimens targeted for glutathione reductase (gr) gene indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1–t48). The gr might eliminate the ROS accumulated during desiccation, but when it is targeted the ROS production is not completely counteracted and the targeted animals need more time to recover motility. Therefore, it is possible to presume that other endogenous molecules not targeted in these specimens take on the activities made by the gr during rehydration, and therefore allow animals to recover their motilities. Another defence counteracting the ROS toxicity involves the system made up by superoxide dismutase and catalase. The first destroys free radical superoxide converting it in H2O2 which is then reduced by catalase72. The data obtained on specimens of P. spatialis whose for catalase (cat) gene had been perturbated by RNAi indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1–t48). Since the action of catalase is similar with that of glutathione peroxidase, it is probable that in animals targeted for catalase, the glutathione peroxidase takes on its function during rehydration. In other species of tardigrades and in other desiccation tolerant animals, experiments confirm the role of this enzyme in the desiccation process to prevent oxidative stress11,47,68,73,74. An upregulation of catalase gene during anhydrobiosis was detected in the tardigrade H. exemplaris (see Yoshida et al.47), in the midges Belgica antarctica and P. vanderplanki (see Cornette & Kikawada11; Lopez-Martines et al.73) and in the nematodes Aphelenchoides fragariae and C. elegans (see Erkut et al.68; Fu et al.74). Targeting superoxide dismutase (sod) via RNAi did not negatively affect the motility percentages of injected animals at any time of rehydration. Comparing the gene repertoire of different tardigrade species, the duplication of sod genes was observed as a common characteristic of anhydrobiotic tardigrades25,71. Since P. spatialis is a good anhydrobiont10,48, it is possible that its sod genes are duplicated as well, and therefore, the targeting of a single sod gene might not be enough to affect the motilities of injected tardigrades, even though the sod genes could play a useful role during desiccation. The trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) enzyme is involved, together with the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, in the biosynthesis pathway of the sugar trehalose. This sugar acts as a common water replacement molecules and stabilizer of biological structures by protecting cellular systems from dehydration and preventing protein aggregation and eliminating ROS1,27,37,75. Despite most anhydrobiotic metazoans, such as the midge P. vanderplanki and the cysts of Artemia spp., use trehalose as a protective mechanism1,38–40, not all tardigrade species produce this sugar, and when they produce it, the amount of trehalose differs among species and it is always very low in comparison with other anhydrobiotic animals20,39,76. The detection of trehalose in Paramacrobiotus species20 and of the tps gene in P. spatialis77, allowed us to target this gene in this study, demonstrating that its targeting did not significantly affect animal motility after a cycle of desiccation/rehydration. In line with this, a recent study showed the presence of three TPS-TPP genes in Paramacrobiotus sp.78, and probably the targeting of a single copy of tps gene cannot be sufficient to have an effect on the motilities of injected animals. Our results demonstrate that trehalose is not the only molecule involved in desiccation tolerance, in line with the concept suggested by Hibshman et al.27 that in desiccation tolerance of some tardigrades other molecules must have protective effects that substitute for the function of trehalose. Therefore, trehalose represents only one possible evolutionary pathway towards desiccation tolerance, and probably, is not the most crucial biochemical adaptation to protect cell during desiccation in tardigrades. This agrees with other completely desiccation tolerant organisms, namely bdelloid rotifers, that are unable to produce trehalose79. Rotifers protect the cells under desiccation stress utilizing different types of molecules, such as LEA proteins, hydrophilins, chaperones (i.e. Heat Shock proteins), antioxidants, and molecules involved in DNA repair6. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins present in all domains of life, ranging from archaea and bacteria to eukaryotes80. They play an intrinsic role in the physiological movements of water across cell membranes, and consequently through the entire organism11,81. They could be an adaptive response to changing water abundance and osmolality in the organism’s habitat82, and to water loss regulation during anhydrobiosis15. Their possible role in anhydrobiotic animals was hypothesized by the discovery in the midge P. vanderplanki of the aquaporin PvAQP145 that rapidly increase its expression at the onset of anhydrobiosis and it is thought to be required to remove the water from the body of the midge larvae11,23,45. Similarly, in the larvae of the goldenrod gall fly Eurosta solidaginis, the AQP3 protein which allows water and glycerol to cross the cell membrane is upregulated following desiccation, indicating that the larva is preparing itself for the osmotic stress associated with desiccation83. In tardigrades, the involvement of aquaporins during anhydrobiosis is supported by the expression of AQP4 in M. cf. tardigradum, at higher levels in the desiccated animals with respect to the active ones84. In the latter tardigrade species, eleven AQP transcripts (denoted MtAqp-1 through MtAqp-11) were identified85, with a high transcript abundance of MtAqp-3, -4, -5, -10. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of aquaporin 3 and aquaporin 10 during rehydration in tardigrades since the targeting for these two aquaporins in P. spatialis by RNAi has negative effects on animal motility immediately after rehydration process (t0). Since animals targeted for aquaporins are able to restore their motility in the course of the rehydration process (t1–t48), P. spatialis can desiccate even if the aquaporins are targeted. However, during rehydration tardigrades need more time to recover their motility, suggesting that aquaporins have a role during rehydration. Although the molecular mechanisms underpinning anhydrobiosis are not yet completely understood, it seems clear that desiccation tolerance depends on the synergic action of an array of many different molecules working together. Our investigation supports this hypothesis and agrees with previous studies demonstrating that tardigrades species have a comprehensive number of genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidant defence25. Future studies on anhydrobiotic animals will further help in understanding the protectants and the mechanisms that contribute to their desiccation survival and could provide avenues for pursuing biotechnologies for the preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.",

Copyright notice ID: 8816950 PMID: 35121798 Abstract Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together. Subject terms: Evolution, ZoologyIntroduction Insufficient hydration is extremely stressful for living organisms as water is required for metabolic reactions. Nevertheless, some animals living in habitats subject to periodic or unpredictable desiccation periods have evolved a remarkable adaptive strategy called anhydrobiosis. This physiological state allows for the nearly complete dehydration of the animal’s body and cells, a reduced or suspended metabolism leading to a temporary suspension of active life processes, and finally a developmental standstill as a direct response to the desiccation of the surrounding habitat of the animals1–4. This state is reversed by the reappearance of environmental water, with the restoring of metabolism and of all features of active life, even after the permanence in a desiccated state for months to decades1,2,4–6. However, anhydrobiosis, as well as the time spent in a desiccated state, can still cause cellular damages, including membrane destabilization, protein and nucleic acid denaturation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress with the eventual death of organisms7–16. To withstand stress caused by the drastic loss of body water, many anhydrobiotic animals first slow the rate of their dehydration by modifying their body in a compact structure that reduces the surface area, and consequently the evaporation rate17–19. Simultaneously, they undergo biochemical changes associated with the synthesis of molecules working as bioprotectants, which replace cellular water or stabilize cellular machinery13,20–27. To gain insights into anhydrobiosis and what bioprotectants help to mediate this phenomenon, tardigrades are an attractive model. Tardigrades are hygrophilous animals that need to be surrounded by a film of water to perform active life. As a consequence, their capability to colonise terrestrial environments (e.g. moss, lichen, soil, and leaf litter) is linked to their well-known ability to enter anhydrobiosis at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult28. As their surroundings lose water, tardigrades lose most (> 95%) of their free and bound body water and suspend their metabolism3. The loss of water is accompanied by the invagination of the intersegmental cuticle and by the retraction of the head and legs, resulting in a compact tun-shaped body3,29,30. Anhydrobiotic (desiccated) tardigrades can withstand several physical and chemical extremes (e.g. very low and high temperature, high pressure, vacuum, organic solvents and radiations) that are far more extreme than that imposed by their natural habitats, including space conditions3,25,26,31–36. As well as in other anhydrobiotic animals, the desiccation in tardigrades is accomplished through morphological changes (tun) together with the synthesis of different bioprotectants20–22,24–27. These molecules include, for example, osmolytes, trehalose, antioxidants, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), Aquaporin Proteins (AQPs) and Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), including the Late Embryogenesis Abundant Proteins (LEA)13,20–22,24–27. Trehalose, a disaccharide with high ability for water-replacement during dehydration, immobilising macromolecules and stabilizing cellular structure through vitrification has long been implicated in desiccation tolerance20,26,37. The presence and the amount of trehalose detected in tardigrades are different from species to species27, but is much lower than the one recorded in other anhydrobiotic animals that use trehalose as mechanism to reduce damages induced by desiccation1,38–40. Therefore, the degree of involvement of trehalose as a protective molecule in anhydrobiotic tardigrades is still debated27. Antioxidants, such as scavenging enzymes, limit oxidative stress, which appears to be one of the most deleterious damages associated with desiccation9. The depletion of water changes the ionic concentration of anhydrobiotic organisms, including tardigrades41, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)9,11,42,43, consisting in free radicals [e.g. superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydroxyl radical (OH·), perhydroxy radical (HO2·)] and non-radical forms [e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2)]44. Water loss therefore increases the susceptibility of biomolecules to the attack of reactive oxygen molecules, damaging proteins, membranes, and DNA9,11,13,22,27,42,43. Since aquaporins contribute to water transport through plasma membranes, some researchers have suggested that they play some role in anhydrobiosis, hypothesizing their involvement in the regulation of water loss to fine tune desiccation kinetics11,23,45–47. However, it remains unclear if aquaporins function in preparing anhydrobiotic animals for desiccation or play a role in rehydration. In this paper, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis Guidetti et al., 2019 was selected as a model organism (Fig. 1) in light of its robust ability to survive desiccation10,48. To understand what bioprotectants might be involved in mitigating the stresses imposed by desiccation, we first sought to identify exactly what those stresses are. As mentioned above, water loss can lead to the generation of deleterious ROS, however this has never been directly tested before in tardigrades. To verify whether desiccation induces production of ROS in tardigrades, we analysed the ROS production in the coelomocytes (storage cells; Fig. 1c). Coelomocytes are round free-floating cells in the body cavity of tardigrades which act as reservoirs and transporters of lipids and glycogen49–52. The number of storage cells in a tardigrade specimen is in the range of a few hundred up to more than 1000 cells according to the species4,52,53, while their size changes along with animal life cycle including oocyte developmental in females54. Contrasting data are reported about the decline in size and number of storage cells after a period of anhydrobiosis in tardigrade species51–53. A decline in size of storage cells is due to the use of stored material as energy requirements to enter and exit anhydrobiosis51. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Paramacrobiotus spatialis.

Genes encoding five antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase), for two aquaporins (aquaporins 3 and 10) and for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were thus targeted using RNA interference (RNAi), and later the successful recover of P. spatialis specimens after desiccation was verified.Results Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in anhydrobiosis The overall level of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was assessed using the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA)55,56. The ROS production in anhydrobiosis was determined measuring the intensity of the fluorescent signal emitted by storage cells of the desiccation tolerant tardigrade P. spatialis. Storage cells are particularly useful as they are numerous as well as the only cell type within the tardigrade body cavity. Storage cells are also easy to obtain and manipulate, whereas other tissues in tardigrades are more difficult to obtain and work with (Fig. 1c,d). Figure 2 shows the fluorescence signals detected respectively 3 h and 12 h after the rehydration process in tardigrade storage cells previously kept in a desiccated state for 1 day and 20 days, and in the animals kept in a hydrated state as control.

The storage cells of desiccated animals always emitted an intense fluorescence signal, while those of control ones emitted a faint spotted fluorescence signal (Fig. 2). The intensity of the fluorescence signal emitted by the storage cells of desiccated animals was always significantly higher than the fluorescence intensity detected in cells of control animals (Fig. 2; Table 1; one-way ANOVA: n = 485; p < 0.001). Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence signal was at its highest level in the coelomocytes of animals kept desiccated for 20 days, while the lowest signal was recorded in cells of tardigrades kept desiccated for 1 day (Fig. 2; Table 1).Disruption of target genes function RNA interference (RNAi) was used to disrupt the function of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in desiccation tolerance in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis. RNAi has previously been characterized in tardigrades and is known to target specific gene products for destruction both in adults during desiccation and in embryos during development24,57. Similarly, it has been shown that large amounts of non-specific dsRNA (e.g. double stranded RNA targeting GFP) do not affect tardigrade survival24 nor embryo viability and development57. In this study, the eight genes targeted by RNAi were: gpx, gr, gst, cat and sod, encoding for enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) that counteract reactive oxygen species; tps, encoding for the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, involved in the pathways of trehalose production; aqp 3 and aqp 10, encoding for aquaporin proteins 3 and 10, which are presumably involved in the rapid transport of water through cell membranes. The involvement of these target genes was verified by comparing the motilities of P. spatialis animals that have exited tun belonging to three groups: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. injected with RNase free water control animals (control 2); 3. injected animals with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the target gene (experimental group). The motility of the animals after a period of anhydrobiosis was evaluated by monitoring locomotion performance (i.e. coordinate movements of the body) immediately after the rehydration process (t0), 1 h (t1), 24 h (t24), and 48 h (t48) later. Additionally, five specimens of P. spatialis were individually injected with dsRNA of each target gene, desiccated, and then rehydrated. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a marked decrease in the expression level of each target gene in comparison to DNA polymerase II (DNA pol II) used as a control gene (Fig. S1), indicating that RNA interference led to a decrease in the targeted gene’s expression level. The assessment of motility in both control 1 (uninjected) and control 2 (water injected) animals always resulted 100% (Fig. 3a,b), since all animals are alive at each time point assayed after the rehydration process. These data demonstrate that the desiccation protocol was suitable for P. spatialis, and that the injection alone does not affect survival of the tardigrades during anhydrobiosis. On the other hand, significant differences were recorded between the motility percentages of both controls and most experimental groups (Fig. 3; Kruskal–Wallis test: number of pairwise comparisons = 132; p < 0.001). For treatments targeting antioxidant enzymes, specimens injected with dsRNA of gpx showed significantly lower motilities with respect to both types of controls at every time after the rehydration process (t0: p < 0.001; t1: p < 0.01; t24: p < 0.01; t48: p < 0.01; Fig. 3c). In animals injected with dsRNA for genes of gr, cat and sod, significant differences with respect to both types of controls were only observed between the percentages of animal motilities recorded at t0 (immediately after the rehydration process) (gr: p < 0.01; cat: p < 0.01; sod: p < 0.01; Fig. 3d,f,g). Significant differences in the motility percentages with respect to both types of controls were also evidenced at t0, t1 and t24 in animals injected with dsRNA of aqp 3 (t0: p < 0.01, t1: p < 0.05; t24: p < 0.05; Fig. 3i) and at t0, t1 and t24 in animals injected with dsRNA of aqp 10 (t0: p < 0.001, t24: p < 0.01; t48: p < 0.01; Fig. 3j).The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of the gst and tps genes did not show significant differences with respect to both types of controls (uninjected and water injected) at every time after the rehydration process (Fig. 3e,h). Since RNAi knockdown of the tps gene resulted in negligible effects on the animal motilities at all times following rehydration, and since the tps dsRNA was the largest used in our study (Table S2), we consider this gene as a further control (control 3), and further evidences that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is not harmful for P. spatialis. The motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA targeting the tps gene compared with the motility percentages of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes shows significant differences (Table S3). These statistical differences are consistent with the scored significances of comparisons between controls (non-injected and water injected) and target genes, except for motility at t0 of animals injected with sod dsRNA, motilities at t1 and t24 of animals targeted for aqp 3 and motilities at t24 and t48 of animals targeted for aqp 10 (Fig. 3; Table S3). Therefore, only for these exceptions is it possible to presume an effect on P. spatialis motilities was due to injection of large dsRNA. Figure 3.

In addition, this study assesses the degree of involvement of various bioprotectants in anhydrobiotic survival of tardigrades using RNA interference to perturb gene functions in Paramacrobiotus spatialis. Storage cells are singular free-floating cells accumulating polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins49,50,58. The faint spotted fluorescence emitted by the storage cells of the control specimens of P. spatialis denotes that in metabolically active animals there is a regular, but small, production of ROS due to the standard metabolic reactions. This has been reported in all living organisms, not only related to anhydrobiosis (see França et al.9; Kranner & Birtić43; Boveris & Chance59). The storage cells of desiccated specimens of P. spatialis emitted an intense fluorescence, demonstrating that anhydrobiosis causes a significant increase in ROS production and consequently of oxidative stress. Previous reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals22,46, or by evaluating the ROS-damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period60. Evidence of the production of free radicals (and consequently of oxidative stress) in anhydrobiosis has been found in other organisms, such as cyanobacteria (see Potts61), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see Pereira et al.62), intertidal seaweeds (see Flores-Molina et al.63), the moss Fontinalis antipyretica (see Cruz de Carvalho et al.64) and the shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicas (see Duan et al.65). In tardigrades, ROS production occurs both during desiccation, and while in a desiccated state. These data can explain the increase in mortality and/or in a long recovery time (i.e. time to recover active life after desiccation) measured in P. spatialis specimens after extended periods in a desiccated state10. These two phenomena are directly proportional to the time spent in a desiccated state, since molecular damages are accumulated with time because metabolism is arrested, and repair systems are not working10. Oxidative stress leads to a long recovery time and to the death of tardigrades since the animals need more time to repair oxidation damages. The glutathione pathway, including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase, is an important antioxidant system involved in the scavenging of ROS13. In this pathway, the glutathione peroxidase and glutathione transferase act by removing hydrogen peroxide, while the glutathione reductase reduces the glutathione disulphide to glutathione9,43. Targeting a gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which is induced by desiccation, compromised survival during desiccation, providing evidence for this gene’s role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance. Targeting of gpx by RNAi in the tardigrade P. spatialis resulted in a significant lower percentage of tardigrades with motility (i.e. lower survival) at every time after the rehydration process with respect to control animals kept hydrated and metabolically active (Controls 1 and 2) and with respect to animals targeted for tps (non-effective gene, Control 3). The effects on the percent motility observed in animals injected with dsRNA of gpx are enhanced by the presence of low copies of this gene in tardigrades25. A similar pattern was obtained with the knockdown of glutathione peroxidase transcripts by RNAi in the nematode Panagrolaimus superbus, which led to a decrease survival post-desiccation66. The glutathione peroxidase enzyme has a crucial role during anhydrobiosis of P. spatialis, since animals targeted for gpx do not recover their motility indicating that other antioxidant enzymes or other endogenous molecules cannot fully replace essential roles of glutathione peroxidase. The important role of this molecule in desiccation tolerance of P. spatialis extend the previous results of Rizzo et al.22, where glutathione peroxidase was one of the enzymes with the higher enzymatic activity. This enzyme is utilised to counteract ROS not only during the dehydration process, but also probably plays a vital role during the rehydration phase22 and thus the enzyme encoded by gpx is essential for tardigrade anhydrobiosis. The crucial role of glutathione peroxidase in tardigrades is in line with its role in counteracting oxidative stress caused by desiccation in other organisms: e.g. in transgenic tobacco plants67, in the larvae of the midge P. vanderplanki11, in the dauer larvae of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans68, and other species of nematodes66,69,70. The targeting of glutathione transferase (gst) had no effects on the motilities of injected animals at any time following rehydration. GSTs have been seen to exist in high copy number in several tardigrade species25,71, implying that P. spatialis may also have a high copy number of these genes. If this is the case, the knockdown of a single putative gene of gst might not be sufficient to perturb anhydrobiosis in this species. The data obtained on P. spatialis specimens targeted for glutathione reductase (gr) gene indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1–t48). The gr might eliminate the ROS accumulated during desiccation, but when it is targeted the ROS production is not completely counteracted and the targeted animals need more time to recover motility. Therefore, it is possible to presume that other endogenous molecules not targeted in these specimens take on the activities made by the gr during rehydration, and therefore allow animals to recover their motilities. Another defence counteracting the ROS toxicity involves the system made up by superoxide dismutase and catalase. The first destroys free radical superoxide converting it in H2O2 which is then reduced by catalase72. The data obtained on specimens of P. spatialis whose for catalase (cat) gene had been perturbated by RNAi indicate that this molecule plays a role in the course of rehydration. Indeed, tardigrades targeted for this gene are immobile immediately after the rehydration process (t0), but then they recover their motility (t1–t48). Since the action of catalase is similar with that of glutathione peroxidase, it is probable that in animals targeted for catalase, the glutathione peroxidase takes on its function during rehydration. In other species of tardigrades and in other desiccation tolerant animals, experiments confirm the role of this enzyme in the desiccation process to prevent oxidative stress11,47,68,73,74. An upregulation of catalase gene during anhydrobiosis was detected in the tardigrade H. exemplaris (see Yoshida et al.47), in the midges Belgica antarctica and P. vanderplanki (see Cornette & Kikawada11; Lopez-Martines et al.73) and in the nematodes Aphelenchoides fragariae and C. elegans (see Erkut et al.68; Fu et al.74). Targeting superoxide dismutase (sod) via RNAi did not negatively affect the motility percentages of injected animals at any time of rehydration. Comparing the gene repertoire of different tardigrade species, the duplication of sod genes was observed as a common characteristic of anhydrobiotic tardigrades25,71. Since P. spatialis is a good anhydrobiont10,48, it is possible that its sod genes are duplicated as well, and therefore, the targeting of a single sod gene might not be enough to affect the motilities of injected tardigrades, even though the sod genes could play a useful role during desiccation. The trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) enzyme is involved, together with the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, in the biosynthesis pathway of the sugar trehalose. This sugar acts as a common water replacement molecules and stabilizer of biological structures by protecting cellular systems from dehydration and preventing protein aggregation and eliminating ROS1,27,37,75. Despite most anhydrobiotic metazoans, such as the midge P. vanderplanki and the cysts of Artemia spp., use trehalose as a protective mechanism1,38–40, not all tardigrade species produce this sugar, and when they produce it, the amount of trehalose differs among species and it is always very low in comparison with other anhydrobiotic animals20,39,76. The detection of trehalose in Paramacrobiotus species20 and of the tps gene in P. spatialis77, allowed us to target this gene in this study, demonstrating that its targeting did not significantly affect animal motility after a cycle of desiccation/rehydration. In line with this, a recent study showed the presence of three TPS-TPP genes in Paramacrobiotus sp.78, and probably the targeting of a single copy of tps gene cannot be sufficient to have an effect on the motilities of injected animals. Our results demonstrate that trehalose is not the only molecule involved in desiccation tolerance, in line with the concept suggested by Hibshman et al.27 that in desiccation tolerance of some tardigrades other molecules must have protective effects that substitute for the function of trehalose. Therefore, trehalose represents only one possible evolutionary pathway towards desiccation tolerance, and probably, is not the most crucial biochemical adaptation to protect cell during desiccation in tardigrades. This agrees with other completely desiccation tolerant organisms, namely bdelloid rotifers, that are unable to produce trehalose79. Rotifers protect the cells under desiccation stress utilizing different types of molecules, such as LEA proteins, hydrophilins, chaperones (i.e. Heat Shock proteins), antioxidants, and molecules involved in DNA repair6. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins present in all domains of life, ranging from archaea and bacteria to eukaryotes80. They play an intrinsic role in the physiological movements of water across cell membranes, and consequently through the entire organism11,81. They could be an adaptive response to changing water abundance and osmolality in the organism’s habitat82, and to water loss regulation during anhydrobiosis15. Their possible role in anhydrobiotic animals was hypothesized by the discovery in the midge P. vanderplanki of the aquaporin PvAQP145 that rapidly increase its expression at the onset of anhydrobiosis and it is thought to be required to remove the water from the body of the midge larvae11,23,45. Similarly, in the larvae of the goldenrod gall fly Eurosta solidaginis, the AQP3 protein which allows water and glycerol to cross the cell membrane is upregulated following desiccation, indicating that the larva is preparing itself for the osmotic stress associated with desiccation83. In tardigrades, the involvement of aquaporins during anhydrobiosis is supported by the expression of AQP4 in M. cf. tardigradum, at higher levels in the desiccated animals with respect to the active ones84. In the latter tardigrade species, eleven AQP transcripts (denoted MtAqp-1 through MtAqp-11) were identified85, with a high transcript abundance of MtAqp-3, -4, -5, -10. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of aquaporin 3 and aquaporin 10 during rehydration in tardigrades since the targeting for these two aquaporins in P. spatialis by RNAi has negative effects on animal motility immediately after rehydration process (t0). Since animals targeted for aquaporins are able to restore their motility in the course of the rehydration process (t1–t48), P. spatialis can desiccate even if the aquaporins are targeted. However, during rehydration tardigrades need more time to recover their motility, suggesting that aquaporins have a role during rehydration. Although the molecular mechanisms underpinning anhydrobiosis are not yet completely understood, it seems clear that desiccation tolerance depends on the synergic action of an array of many different molecules working together. Our investigation supports this hypothesis and agrees with previous studies demonstrating that tardigrades species have a comprehensive number of genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidant defence25. Future studies on anhydrobiotic animals will further help in understanding the protectants and the mechanisms that contribute to their desiccation survival and could provide avenues for pursuing biotechnologies for the preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.Methods Collection of the target species The eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis Guidetti et al. 2019 was used as target species. Specimens were collected from hazel-leaf litter at Formigine (80 m a.s.l.; 44° 34.253′ N, 10° 50.892′ E, Modena, Northern Italy). Leaf litter was immersed in tap water and then animals were extracted from their substrate by means of sieves, picked up with a glass pipette under a stereomicroscope and stored in tap water and natural mineral water 1:1 (rearing water) at 16 °C for 24 h before their use10,31.Experimental desiccation and rehydration of tardigrades Animals were desiccated using a climate chamber (CHL, Angelantoni Industrie, Milan, Italy) that allows to control air temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the air. Animals were placed on a blot filter paper with a drop of rearing water and kept at 18 °C and 80% RH for 4 h, then to 50% RH for 4 h, and finally at 20 °C and 0–3% RH overnight41. At the end of these steps, the tardigrade body has the typical compact tun shape structure of a desiccated/anhydrobiotic tardigrade (Fig. 1d). To rehydrate desiccated tardigrades, small amounts of rearing water were slowly added on each filter paper every 10 min for a total of 60 min, this rehydration step is here termed the “rehydration process”. Rehydrated tardigrades were maintained at 16 °C and observed under a stereomicroscope. Coordinated and active movements of the body (locomotion performance) constituted the criterion to evaluate tardigrade motility (survival). Locomotion performance was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1 h (t1) and 24 h (t24) (see Altiero et al.34).Detection of reactive oxygen species production under desiccation The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was detected after specimens of P. spatialis were kept in a desiccated state for 1 and 20 days (see above protocol) at 16 °C and 0–3% RH. In particular, ROS production was evaluated in coelomocytes (storage cells) 3 and 12 h after the rehydration process. As control, specimens kept in rearing water were used. For each experimental conditions and controls, 2–5 animals were used, and for each animal 6–45 singular storage cells randomly chosen were analysed (Table S1). The fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA) diluted in methanol was used. It is the most common probe to detect overall level of intracellular ROS55,56. Preliminary tests evidenced that tardigrades survive when kept for 45 min in methanol used for dilution (methanol: distilled water, 1:10). Each tardigrade was sonicated for 90 s in rearing water to allow the entrance of the probe in the tardigrade, and then incubated in 1 ml of 10 µM DCFH2-DA in methanol for 45 min at 20 °C in the dark. After these steps, each tardigrade was washed with rearing water, mounted on a slide with rearing water as mounting medium. Then, the animal was gently broken with a pressure on cover slip to obtain the release of isolated storage cells. Cells were observed using Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal scanner microscope mounted on a Leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope, with an Ar excitation laser (λexc = 488 nm) for DCFH2-DA (λem = 543 nm) available at Centro Interdipartimentale Grandi Strumenti (CIGS) of University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The ROS signal was measured quantifying the intensity of the fluorescence signal of each storage cell using the program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The fluorescence intensity of storage cells was standardised removing the storage cell size effect and the background signal. The following formula was used: Intensity of the storage cell signal = total fluorescence intensity of storage cell - [(x/y)·z]. In which: x = mean of two areas of the fluorescence intensity, y = mean of two background areas, z = storage cell area. The mean value of fluorescence intensity of all previously measured storage cells was considered for each experimental condition (Table S2). The statistical comparisons of ROS signals among the different experimental groups and controls were evaluated through the analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) with a Tukey post-hoc test, using the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL. USA).Targeting of genes potentially involved in desiccation tolerance The RNA interference technique was utilised to target eight tardigrade genes. The genes gpx, gr, gst, cat, sod and tps (encoding the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, respectively), and aqp 3 and aqp 10 (encoding the membrane channel aquaporin proteins 3 and 10) were targeted in order to disrupt their function. To verify the involvement of these target genes in the desiccation tolerance of P. spatialis, three groups of animals were used: 1. uninjected control animals (control 1); 2. control animals injected with RNase free water (control 2); 3. injected animals with the dsRNA of a target gene (experimental group). For each target gene, three replicates each of 10 P. spatialis specimens (experimental group) were used. Each animal was injected with the dsRNA of a single target gene at the concentration of 4 µg/µl (see paragraph below). For both control groups, three replicates each of 10 animals were used. The methodological steps applied to animals were: injection (except for control 1), desiccation, rehydration, and check of animal motility. The injection was performed following the protocol by Tenlen et al.57 with slight modifications. In particular, injection needles were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries 1B100F-4 (Word Precision Instruments, Inc.) using a PC-10 Puller (Narishige). Injection slides were prepared as indicated by Tenlen et al.57. Injections of the animals were performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and a manual micromanipulator (Leitz Wetzlar) linked to a Hamilton Microliter™ syringe. Needle tips were broken by gently stroking the tips against the edge of a triangular coverslip piece to obtain an opening in the needle tip of 2–3 µm in diameter. The successful injection of dsRNA or RNAfree water into the body cavity of tardigrades was confirmed by the swelling of the body as indicated by Tenlen et al.57. All injected tardigrades were transferred in rearing water and left overnight to allow the dsRNA to disrupt the gene function, as indicated by Boothby et al.24. Therefore, they were individually desiccated as described above, kept desiccated for 2 days, and rehydrated using the protocol described above. Tardigrade motility was recorded using the criterion of locomotion performance, which was evaluated right after the rehydration process (t0) and after 1 h (t1), 24 h (t24) and 48 h (t48). The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare the percentage of motile tardigrades (with locomotion performance) injected with dsRNA with respect to those of controls 1 and 2 at t0, t1, t24 and t48. The tps gene was chosen as a further control (Control 3) to exclude the possibility that the injection of large amount of dsRNA is harmful for P. spatialis, since animals targeted for this gene exhibited negligible effects on the motilities at every time of rehydration. The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to compare the motility percentages of tardigrades injected with tps dsRNA with respect to those of animals injected with dsRNA of other target genes at t0, t1, t24 and t48. The statistical analysis was performed with the program SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).Synthesis of specific target gene dsRNA The transcriptome of P. spatialis24,86 was compared with the transcriptome of the eutardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris Gąsiorek, Stec, Morek & Michalczyk, 201824 and with sequences of the nematode C. elegans Maupas, 190087 contained in WormBase and GenBank. Obtained sequences were aligned using the program BLAST to design gene-specific primers (Table S4). Genomic DNA was extracted from five specimens of P. spatialis using the Worm Lysis Buffer57. Gene-specific primers (Table S4) were used to amplify the target sequence with these cycles: first denaturation step for 2 min at 95 °C, at least 15 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at 70 °C for 1 min with a decreasing rate of 1 °C/cycle until the melting temperature (Tm; Table S4) of the tested primers is reached, 2 min at 72 °C, 30 cycles with 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at Tm of the tested primers for 1 min, and 2 min at 72 °C, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products of each target gene were directly inserted into a plasmid vector (pCR™ -Blunt II-TOPO® vector) and cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher). The recombinant vector was then used to transform competent Mach1™ T1R cells of Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher). To verify if the target gene has been inserted in the vector, a PCR reaction was performed using the purified plasmid DNA as a template and gene-specific primers, with this cycle: 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 53 °C for 30 s min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. After successful control of the amplification, several clones were sequenced for each gene, using gene-specific primers. After sequencing, the plasmid sequence was aligned with the target gene sequence using the program BLAST to check the real insertion of the target gene in the plasmid and the absence of introns in the sequence. New primers were designed by adding the sequence of promoter T7 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) to the 5′ portion of each original gene specific primer sequence (Table S4) and they were used to synthesize dsRNA from the P. spatialis genomic DNA, using the T7 RiboMAX™ Express RNAi System (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following ethanol precipitation, dsRNA of each target gene was resuspended in nuclease-free water and was ready to be used in RNAi. The targeted genes and their sequence references are reported in Table S2. The list of targeted sequences is reported in the supplementary section.Protocol to verify the successful targeting of genes by RNAi A protocol was designed to verify if RNAi led to a decrease of each target gene expression level. A new group of five specimens of P. spatialis were injected with each target gene specific dsRNA, then individually desiccated, and rehydrated following the protocols described above. At t0 (after the rehydration process), total RNA was extracted from each animal using the MasterPure Kit (Epicentre), and then used to synthesise cDNA using the SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, each target gene was amplified using the specific primers designed on P. spatialis transcriptome (Table S4) and applying the same thermal cycling conditions described above. As a PCR control, the same RNA extracted from each individual tardigrade was used to amplify the DNA polymerase II, which was used as control gene (accession number: GFGY01000030; position: 7492–7959; length: 468 bp; targeted sequence in supplementary section). For this gene, specific designed primers (F- 5′-GTC ACG GAC GAA GGA GAA TTT A-3′; R- 5′-ACG TGA AGA TGG GCG TAT TG-3′) were used.Supplementary Information Supplementary Information.

Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments. Keywords: mice, unloading, disuse osteoporosis, partial weightbearing, spaceflight musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with spaceflight has been noted since the early days of the Gemini program. Despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures, negative calcium balance (∼0.5%/mo) and bone loss in weight-bearing bones (1.0–2.7%/mo) are still the hallmarks of flight (12–15, 29). Although the mechanisms of disuse-induced bone loss and age-related bone loss are not identical, a 20% decline in femoral neck bone mineral density during a single year of spaceflight corresponds to 30 yr of age-related bone loss in a postmenopausal woman, bringing with it a significant increase in fracture risk (16). Furthermore, subject-specific finite-element analyses indicate that femoral bone strength declines by 2%/mo during spaceflight, with some astronauts exhibiting reductions in proximal femoral strength that are comparable to estimated lifetime losses in bone strength associated with aging (11). Whereas human spaceflight over the last 30 yr has been confined exclusively to low Earth orbit, and largely to flights of less than 6 mo, exploration goals once again reach beyond the Van Allen belts. Although the physiological effects of weightlessness are well described, the effects of chronic partial weight bearing, such as expected on the moon (16% of Earth's gravity) and Mars (38% of Earth's gravity), have yet to be quantified. In these environments, the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and accompanying orthopedic injury are uncertain, and methods to further investigate adaptations to partial weight bearing are needed. Based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the primary stimulus for skeletal maintenance (4, 10, 24), it is likely that partial weight bearing will provide some prophylaxis against the deconditioning seen in conditions of full disuse. But how do adaptive processes scale with changes in gravitational loading? Does a given decrease in gravitational acceleration lead to a proportionate decrease in bone and muscle mass, or is this response curve nonlinear? The answers to these questions are important, not only for aerospace physiology, but also for a better understanding of the effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions and diseases. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to develop a new rodent model of partial weight suspension (PWS) to explore these musculoskeletal effects of chronically reduced weight bearing and to conduct the first study of musculoskeletal adaptation to Mars gravity levels. We hypothesized that musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight bearing would replicate the key features of adaptation to full unloading, including reduced bone formation rate, muscle mass, bone mass, and bone strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS We first describe the development of the PWS system and then detail an in vivo study with mice exposed to Mars-analog loading. Description of PWS system. The PWS system draws on design elements developed for human research in partial weight-bearing locomotion, coupling them with lessons learned over 3 decades of rodent suspension (2, 18, 22). Developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1979, classic hindlimb or tail suspension utilizes tail traction and hindquarter elevation to fully unload the animal's rear limbs, while the forelimbs remain weight bearing and support locomotion. Bone loss and muscle atrophy accompany this disuse, providing a good model for studying the effects of, and countermeasures to, spaceflight and other disuse. However, the model is not readily extensible to loading conditions between normal and full unloading. The PWS system was designed, and verified in testing, to 1) support mice in partial weight-bearing quadrupedal loading for periods of at least 3 wk; 2) be tunable to within ±5% of a desired hypodynamic stimulus between 10 and 80% weight bearing; 3) provide an environment that minimizes stress to the animals, as measured by body mass changes; 4) support movement, cleaning, and feeding; and 5) allow for full recovery to facilitate reloading studies. All experimental protocols were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were singly housed in specially developed habitats derived from designs of NASA Ames Research Center and Cornell University (18). The living volumes were 12-in. polycarbonate cubes, with wooden feet supporting the corners and removable perforated floors that passively minimized waste buildup. Sitting atop the cages, an aluminum channel provided a rigid base for suspension hardware (Fig. 1A). A steel rod supported a small nylon wheel and low-friction bearing to provide linear freedom of motion for the suspended animals. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab A: Partial Weight Suspension habitat with polycarbonate walls, perforated PVC floor and lid, and aluminum channel supporting suspension hardware. Note that holes in this drawing are oversized. Actual openings are 4.8 mm in diameter and allow for passive passage of waste without risk of injury to the animals. B: system for measuring effective body mass. Animals were suspended above a scale, and spring tension was adjusted to provide the desired level of partial weight bearing. [Image credit: Shaun Modi]In contrast to previous models (25), we opted for a quadrupedal suspension design to help preserve normal gait characteristics and loading patterns. A full-body suspension design was developed around the traditional Morey-Holton tail suspension model and previous whole body harness models (19, 25). A “second-skin” bandage of Tegaderm or SteriStrip (3M, St. Paul, MN) was loosely wrapped at the base of the tail to prevent irritation, and a small piece of athletic tape secured the tail to the harness. The forelimbs were supported by a flexible, breathable “jacket” of athletic tape and soft moleskin, secured by Velcro under isoflurane anesthesia. Several pilot studies resulted in the optimization of the jacket design, allowing the jacketed mice to demonstrate feeding, grooming, sleeping, exploring, and other appropriate daily activities. As seen in Fig. 1B, the harness and tail wrap were connected by an adjustable bead chain and spaced by a hollow metal rod to distribute loading. A previously published system that supported partial weight bearing on the forelimbs with unloaded hindlimbs relied on a complex active feedback system to provide frequency-tuned loading (25). We opted instead to focus on adjusting peak loading levels with minimum complexity. Thus we implemented a passive suspension design using a low-modulus plastic-coated spring (k ≈ 1.6 N/m; S0101 coil cord, Statico, San Carlos, CA). Twisting the spring through its support engaged a variable number of coils, N, thereby changing the spring constant proportional to 1/N. Small swivels prevented spring bind-up, and a plastic lid secured above the animal inhibited climbing. Total mass of the suspension element was 14 g, which was fully supported under static conditions and did not contribute to the standing mass of the animal. Daily weighing of suspended animals quantified the static loads experienced during quiet standing. True body masses were first obtained by briefly hanging the animal on a specially designed rig positioned over a scale, so as to avoid full weight bearing (18). Titrated weight bearing, expressed throughout as effective body mass, was then measured with the animal standing in quadrupedal PWS on the same scale (Fig. 1B). Adjustments to spring tension were made as necessary to accommodate changes in body mass and spring stiffness.Ground reaction force measurement. To quantify the dynamic loading environment of PWS, a high-precision three-axis force plate (HE-6x6-1 AccuSway Force Plate, AMTI Measurements, Watertown, MA) was used to measure ground reaction forces (GRF) during active locomotion. A plywood platform was built over the plate to provide a level walking surface, with a 2-cm-wide strip of plywood atop the force plate as a local load sensor, as described by Zumwalt et al. (33). The platform was covered with cloth tape to improve traction, and mice locomoted freely over the surface. GRFs were collected in three orthogonal directions: X (nose to tail), Y (mediolateral), and Z (vertical). Signals were filtered with a two-pole, low-pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 25 Hz (MATLAB filter routine, The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Peak forces were identified in all three directions. The rate of force onset was estimated as the slope of the initial portion of the GRF rise. Stance duration and area under the force curve were also calculated. Trials were conducted with and without a forelimb vest, and under PWS at 16, 38, and/or 60% weight bearing. Traces were selected for analysis whenever a single forelimb made unobstructed contact with the local load sensor strip. In most cases, this first forelimb footfall was immediately followed by the ipsilateral hindlimb. All evaluated impacts were confirmed with video footage. Data were gathered from a single female mouse (10 wk old, BALB/cByJ) for internal consistency and includes pairs of footfalls from normal gait (n = 4), jacketed gait (n = 5), and suspension at 60% (n = 5), 38% (Mars, n = 4), and 16% (Lunar, n = 11 forelimb, 3 hindlimb) weight bearing.Design of Mars-analog weight-bearing study. Ten-week-old female nulliparous BALB/cByJ mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). This age was chosen to take advantage of the plateau in longitudinal femoral growth, which is more representative of the adult human skeleton, and a near maximum in trabecular bone volume (5, 6), which improves the likelihood of visualizing changes in this compartment. Animals were randomly assigned to four groups: Baseline (killed at start, n = 8), Age-matched (killed at end, n = 21 to provide additional statistical power), Mars (38% weight bearing, n = 10), and Jacket controls (100% weight bearing, n = 13). Baseline and Age groups were group-housed in standard laboratory vivarium caging with ad libitum access to both food and water. Mars animals were singly housed, harnessed, and suspended at 38% weight bearing for 21 days. Jacket control animals were similarly harnessed and singly housed in experimental cages, but remained fully weight bearing for the 21-day experiment. Before the start of the experiment, Mars and Jacket mice underwent a 2-day period of adaptation to the forelimb harnesses. Food and water access were provided ad libitum in Mars, Age, and Baseline groups, whereas Jacket mice were pair-fed, according to the previous day's average of the Mars cohort. Daily care, weighing, and adjustment of spring tension were provided to all animals as described above. One Mars mouse was removed from the study due to self-inflicted tail injury. Two Jacket animals were removed due to excessive weight loss caused by failure to adapt to the harnesses. Four additional mice (1 Age, 3 Jacket) were removed due to complications arising from a prestudy blood draw. Intraperitoneal injections of calcein (0.05 ml, 12 mg calcein/ml of 2% saline-bicarbonate solution, ∼30 mg/kg) were given at 10 and 2 days before death to label newly forming bone. Following death by carbon dioxide inhalation, the gastrocnemius muscles were weighed. Femurs, tibiae, and humerii were harvested bilaterally from all study animals. Left side bones were prepared for imaging and biomechanical testing in gauze soaked in normal saline (0.9%), then stored at −20°C. Right side bones were prepared for histology in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C for 48–72 h, then transferred to 70% ethanol, and returned to refrigeration.Bone microarchitecture. Trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture were assessed using high-resolution microcomputed tomography (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland), as previously described (5). Briefly, the distal femoral metaphysis and femoral midshaft were scanned using a 12-μm isotropic voxel size. Morphometric parameters were computed using a direct three-dimensional approach that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying structure. For the cancellous bone region, we assessed bone volume fraction [bone volume per total volume (BV/TV), %], trabecular thickness (μm), trabecular separation (μm), trabecular number (mm−1), connectivity density (mm−3), and structure model index. For the cortical regions at the distal femoral metaphysis and femoral midshaft, we measured the total cross-sectional area, cortical bone area (BA), medullary area (all mm2), and cortical thickness (Ct.Th; μm). The maximum, minimum, and polar (all mm4) moments of inertia were also measured at the femoral midshaft.Biomechanical assessment. Following μCT scanning, the strength of the femoral midshaft was assessed by 3-point bending. Specimens were thawed to room temperature in physiological saline to ensure adequate hydration, then placed posterior surface downward on a 6-mm span. A low-force mechanical testing system (MTS Bionix 200, with 100 N load cell, MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) was used to apply a flexion moment to the midpoint of the anterior diaphysis. A preload of 1–2 N was applied, followed by a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s until failure. Force-displacement data were acquired at 100 Hz and used to determine structural properties (moment at yield, ultimate moment, bending stiffness, and postyield work). Bending rigidity for each specimen was normalized by the minimum moment of inertia, as measured on the μCT scans, to derive an estimated elastic modulus. Three specimens (one Age and two Mars) were removed due to technical errors during the mechanical testing.Histomorphometry. Following μCT, the five tibiae in each group nearest to the median value for trabecular bone volume fraction were selected for histomorphometry, then processed using previously described methods (26). Un-decalcified thin sections (4 μm) were prepared and stained with toluidine blue or left unstained. A standard histomorphometric analysis of the proximal tibial metaphysis was performed (OsteoMeasure analysis system, OsteoMetrics, Decatur, GA) in a 1.28-mm2 area starting 0.3 mm distal from the growth plate. Histomorphometry methods, variables, and nomenclature conform to those recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (23).Data analysis. To examine the effect of aging during the study, we compared Age mice to Baseline mice using unpaired t-tests. To examine the differences between Age, Jacket, and Mars groups, we utilized an ANOVA with Fisher's paired least significant difference for post hoc comparisons. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.RESULTS GRFs. For each of the 21 days of the study, static values of effective body mass were set within 1 g of the desired weight-bearing level (mean error = −4.1 ± 1.0% true body mass). Average drift overnight was 0.5 g (2.5 ± 4.9% true body mass). Static weight bearing at the beginning and end of each day remained within 5% of target levels on 77% of study days, deviating >10% from desired weight bearing on <2% of all study days. During locomotion, peak dynamic GRFs in the vertical direction were reduced ∼25 and 14% in the forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively, by application of the jacket, suggesting a relative unweighting of the forelimbs due to the restrictions of the forelimb vest. Compared with full weight bearing, Mars weight bearing reduced the mean peak vertical GRF at self-selected walking speeds by 64% in the forelimbs and 85% in the hindlimbs, while Lunar weight bearing reduced mean peak vertical GRF at self-selected walking speeds by 75% in the forelimbs and 85% in the hindlimbs (P < 0.001 for all relative to full weight bearing, Fig. 2, Table 1).

Suspension also sharply reduced the rate of onset of vertical GRFs in both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs (Table 1). For example, with Mars suspension, the rate of vertical force onset was 73 and 92% lower than with full weight bearing in the forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively. Stance duration was also significantly higher in suspended animals. Although the absolute magnitude of transverse GRFs (GRFx and GRFy) was lower in suspension, the ratio of each of these in-plane forces to vertical GRFz tended to be larger, particularly in the hindlimb.Body mass and food intake. Following 2 days of adaptation to the forelimb jackets, there were no significant differences in initial body mass across the groups (mean = 20.5 ± 1.2 g). Food usage for Mars animals decreased sharply at the time of suspension, stabilizing between days 6 and 7. Consistent with this, Mars animals lost 6.5 ± 2.7% of their body mass during the first week (P < 0.0001 relative to Age controls, zz). In weeks 2 and 3, there were no significant differences in maintenance of body mass between Age and Mars groups, suggesting that stress levels had normalized. Unexpected weight gain was seen in the jacketed control animals (Jacket), who experienced caloric restriction in the first week of the study, while being pair fed to match the Mars animals (Fig. 3). After an initial decline in both food consumption and body mass, the Jacket animals experienced a rapid increase in body mass, showing significantly higher weight gain in weeks 2 and 3 (11 ± 5%) than Age or Mars animals (both 2 ± 1%, P < 0.001), resulting in a final Jacket body mass significantly higher than both Mars and Age controls (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Daily body mass for 21-day Mars-analog suspension study in female mice. After an initial adaptation period, Mars animals (■) showed similar maintenance of weight as Age-matched controls (△). Jacket animals (♦) gained significantly more weight in the same period. Error bars represent ± SE. *Body mass significantly different from that of Age controls (P < 0.05).Muscle mass. Compared with Baseline values, Age animals had greater muscle mass. Mars animals had 20–23% lower gastrocnemius muscle wet mass than Jacket and Age controls (Table 2). Gastrocnemius mass normalized to body mass was also significantly lower for Mars animals relative to Age controls (−13%, P = 0.04). Despite their weight gain, Jacket animals did not show increased gastrocnemius wet mass compared with Age controls, either absolute or weight normalized. Table 2.

Bone microarchitecture by μCT. Compared with Baseline values, Age animals had decreased trabecular bone volume and a relative maintenance of cortical parameters (Table 2). Trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture were further deteriorated in Mars animals compared with both Age and Jacket controls (Table 2). In the distal femoral metaphysis, trabecular BV/TV was 24% less in Mars than Age (P = 0.0001, Table 2), whereas there was no difference in trabecular number or separation. Rather, BV/TV losses were driven by a significant trabecular thinning, leading to a shift in the structural model index toward rodlike geometry. At the femoral midshaft, Mars mice had a smaller cross-sectional area and area moments of inertia than Age controls (Table 2). Ct.Th and cortical BA at both the midshaft and the distal femoral metaphysis were also significantly lower in Mars than in Age controls. Similar results were seen for Mars animals relative to Jacket, with significantly smaller moments of inertia in the femoral midshaft, as well as reduced Ct.Th and BA in both the femoral midshaft and distal metaphysis.Biomechanical properties. In Mars mice, the morphometric changes described above were associated with significant decrements in biomechanical properties relative to Age-matched controls, as demonstrated by three-point bending to failure (Table 3). Failure (or ultimate) moment was 27% lower in Mars samples relative to Age controls (P = 0.0002). Bending stiffness and moment at yield were also significantly lower in Mars animals relative to Age controls (P < 0.05). When structural biomechanical properties were normalized to area moments of inertia, the resulting estimated Young's modulus did not differ significantly between Mars and Age groups, suggesting that changes in biomechanical properties were due primarily to geometric changes.

Despite their similarities in morphology, the biomechanical properties of Jacket femurs were weaker than those of Age controls, and did not differ from those of Mars animals, with the exception of a lower estimated Young's modulus in Jacket specimens.Histology. Baseline animals had higher bone formation parameters than Age-controls (who were 3 wk older), including significantly increased mineral apposition rate, osteoid surface, and number of osteoblasts (Table 4). At the end of the study, compared with Age-matched controls, Mars animals had reduced indexes of bone formation, including significantly less mineralizing surface (per bone surface), and osteoid surface (per bone surface) (Table 4). Mars animals had lower osteoclast numbers compared with Age-matched controls. This observation, along with no differences in eroded surface, suggests unchanged or slightly lower rates of bone resorption in Mars animals. Jacket animals had significantly less mineralizing surface than Age controls, and more osteoclasts and osteoid surface than the Mars specimens. Table 4.

DISCUSSION Our first objective was to develop a new rodent model of PWS to explore the musculoskeletal effects of chronically reduced weight bearing. In keeping with the key functional requirements outlined earlier, this study successfully demonstrated extended quadrupedal partial weight bearing at tunable levels, while minimizing animal stress and adequately supporting characteristic animal behaviors. While not shown here, other studies by our group showed that mice removed from the PWS system after suspension were immediately able to return to full weight bearing. More specifically, the design of our hardware and experimental methods ensured that average static loads were proportionally reduced relative to the degree of animal suspension. Daily weighing and titration of effective weight allowed for tight control of these chronic loads, generally to well within 5% of desired weight-bearing levels. Force platform measurements of locomotor GRFs demonstrated that peak GRFs and force onset (i.e., strain rate) were lower for suspension animals than controls. The reductions in peak force were somewhat larger than predicted simply by the level of suspension, perhaps due to effects of dynamic locomotion and/or the independent effects of forelimb harnessing. Whereas jackets alone led to more equal weight sharing between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, suspension gaits tended to favor the forelimbs. Observed increases in the ratio of transverse to vertical GRFs suggest a greater relative need for stabilization in partial weight-bearing animals, despite the moderating presence of harness forces. Such increased expenditure for postural stability is consistent with human studies of partial weight-bearing locomotion (21). Some caution is warranted in interpreting gait data, as variable locomotor speeds were adopted under the different weight-bearing conditions. Across trials, suspended animals adopted a significantly lower average speed (10.98 ± 4.77 cm/s) than nonsuspended animals (38.69 ± 17.22 cm/s, P < 0.0001). Because peak force increases with decreasing stance time (1), it is, therefore, likely that our data underestimate the amount of peak force reduction that might be observed in a speed-matched trial. A variety of changes in gait kinematics and dynamics have been seen in prior studies of human partial weight bearing and may well be expected under true partial gravity conditions (21, 22). Like these studies, our data do not show linear reductions in peak vertical GRFs during walking, but they are representative of free gait for each of our experimental conditions and should be characteristic of the actual peak forces observed during daily living for each group. Additionally, all locomotor data were acquired in an animal newly adapted to suspension. Future studies should investigate whether there are additional differences associated with neuromuscular adaptation or disuse-induced muscle loss following chronic exposure to partial weight bearing. Our second objective was to use our partial weight-bearing system to conduct the first study of adaptation to Mars gravity levels. We found that 3 wk of Mars analog loading was well tolerated and led to significant musculoskeletal deterioration relative to age-matched controls. We utilized 10-wk-old BALB/cByJ female mice, as this is an age when longitudinal growth and body mass gains are minimal. Moreover, at this age, trabecular bone volume is at near maximal levels (5, 6), which mimics peak bone mass of most astronauts and which optimized our ability to detect declines in trabecular bone. Compared with the Baseline group, normally weight-bearing Age controls had decreased trabecular bone volume, but increased cortical thickness at the femoral diaphysis, which was accompanied by significant increases in stiffness. Additional studies are needed to determine whether age influences the musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight bearing, as has been suggested for hindlimb suspension (27). Corticosterone and other systemic stress hormones are known to be catabolic to both muscle and bone. In tail-suspension studies, body mass has been established as a gross surrogate marker for chronic systemic stress (17). The weight loss in the Mars-analog and jacketed control animals during the first week of suspension suggests a brief period of increased stress and adaptation to the experimental environment, due to some combination of environmental or feeding effects, not simply suspension. However, the return of normal growth rates in Mars animals in weeks 2 and 3, and the accompanying stabilization of food consumption, suggest that systemic stress due to the experimental treatment is negligible after the initial adaptive period. Similar results have been seen in centrifuge studies (30, 31) and tail-suspension experiments (32). In future PWS studies, characterization of corticosterone levels could provide a more sensitive stress profile. Additional cohorts killed during the study for histomorphometry could also clarify if this transient is associated with changes in bone resorption, which may be obscured in our poststudy measures. As noted, jacketed but fully weight-bearing mice experienced an unexpected increase in body mass, showing significantly higher weight gain in the second and third weeks of the study compared with either age-matched or Mars-analog animals. This weight gain was not correlated with additional longitudinal bone growth or muscle gain in the gastrocnemius, suggesting a shift in body composition toward higher fat content or muscular hypertrophy elsewhere in the body. Caloric restriction in mice results in significantly decreased resting metabolic rate and reductions in energy expenditures from exercise (7). Weight gain in calorically restricted animals is largely due to increases in adipose body fraction, while lean mass changes are curtailed relative to controls. If the pair-fed jacketed animals adopted a reduced metabolic rate during caloric restriction, then returned to normal consumption levels, weight gain and increasing body fat may have been expected. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal measures of body composition to resolve this open question. Additionally, activity levels may vary between groups and should be monitored in future studies to better differentiate the impact of this variable on key outcomes. Due to the sharp body mass increase in Jacket controls and the strong relationship between musculoskeletal parameters and body mass (3), we focused our analysis on the comparison between Mars and Age animals, which had similar body weights. Patterns of bone loss were generally consistent with previous reports from tail-suspension experiments, with greater losses in the trabecular compartment than cortical, and sharper reductions in bone formation than resorption, as observed at the end of the study. While we believe the predominant effects of PWS are due to differences in weight bearing, a few observations (i.e., femoral biomechanics and tibial histology) taken at the end of the experiment showing differences between jacketed, fully weight-bearing mice and age-matched controls suggest that the musculoskeletal response may have been influenced by the experimental conditions themselves. There are several factors that may have contributed to these observations. First, Jacket mice were singly housed, whereas Age-matched controls were group housed. This is relevant, as singly housed mice have been shown to have lower whole body bone mass relative to group-housed mice (20). Second, jacketed mice were pair fed to Mars consumption levels and thus calorie restricted relative to age-matched controls. Finally, jacketed mice were restrained slightly by the jacket and exhibited altered gait compared with unjacketed controls. Altogether, these factors may have contributed to the differences between age-matched and jacketed animals. Further studies with additional control groups (i.e., singly housed, no jacket), larger group sizes, and alternate time points are needed to delineate the effects of weight-bearing status vs. experimental conditions. Mice exposed to partial weight bearing exhibited several physiological changes consistent with those previously reported in hindlimb suspension studies, including decreased muscle and bone mass and reduced bone formation indexes. Compared with a previously published study of hindlimb suspension in female mice of the same genetic background, both cortical and trabecular bone losses in Mars animals were less than those previously reported for this mouse strain (9). However, we note that this observation was made by comparing studies conducted in different laboratories, and, although provocative, it is clear that additional studies are needed to provide direct comparisons of the musculoskeletal adaptations to various partial weight-bearing and full unloading environments. In particular, the addition of a tail-suspension control to future studies of partial weight bearing will enable researchers to better explore the potentially osteoprotective effects of partial weight bearing in contrast to full unloading and the role of fluid shift in these changes. Our model of reduced gravitational loading is subject to many of the limitations common to all ground-based models of partial weight bearing. In particular, suspension forces are localized at the harness points, while normal Earth gravity acts on the distributed masses of the limbs. Suspension hardware somewhat limits the animals' range of motion, particularly in the spine, and is not tolerated well by all animals. Experience in harnessing and suspending is necessary to minimize morbidity. There is some variation of upward force across the gait cycle due to small displacements of the animal's center of mass during normal locomotion. Furthermore, sensorimotor changes expected in true reduced-gravity environments due to altered vestibular inputs are not present. However, our data indicate that the PWS system is able to model chronic conditions of reduced dynamic loading of the musculoskeletal system, providing a valuable tool for investigations in this area. Selection of an appropriate control depends on experimental objectives, but should account for the effects of single housing in novel cage structures without bedding. Data presented here suggest that application of a forelimb jacket in fully weight-bearing animals may have side effects of increased weight gain and alterations in gait. Further study is required to understand the origin and impacts of these changes. Traditional tail suspension studies utilize a 30° head-down suspension to provide normal loads to the forelimbs without excessive tension on the tail (8). However, while notable cephalic fluid shift and the diuresis it engenders are typical of human flight responses, the magnitude is excessive relative to actual flight responses in small quadrupeds (28). Thus our model, which does not cause fluid shift, may, in fact, more accurately represent rodent spaceflight changes. In conclusion, we have presented a novel approach to ground studies of chronic partial weight bearing that is extensible to a wide range of loading regimes, including studies of interventions and reloading. Three weeks of Mars-analog loading showed decreased muscle mass, along with deterioration of both cortical and trabecular bone relative to controls. Further studies are needed to explore whether there is a threshold of loading beyond which such skeletal degradation slows appreciably, offering key insights into countermeasures against bone loss in spaceflight, bed rest, and other catabolic states. Such studies would have direct relevance for human spaceflight, as well as clinical conditions of reduced musculoskeletal loading due to disease, injury, or inactivity.GRANTS Funding for this work was provided by the Whitaker Biomedical Foundation Graduate Fellowship Program, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Graduate Student Research Program (NNG 04-GN71H), and National Space Biomedical Research Institute Bioastronautics Graduate Program (EO01001), and by the National Institutes of Health (R21 AR057522).DISCLOSURES No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Special thanks to Vaida Glatt, John Mueller, Wen Hui Tan, Kachina Gosselin, and Aaron Harman for technical assistance with these studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.

    "introduction": "Introduction According to Frost’s mechanostat theory,(1,2) bone adapts its structure to maintain the strain engendered by physiological loading within a threshold range. Studies using animal models of overloading (mechanical loading above the threshold range) have allowed further refinement to the mechanostat theory by describing the dependence of bone formation on mechanical parameters such as strain rate, strain frequency, strain magnitude, loading history, daily strain stimulus, and rest insertion.(3) Animal studies have also been used to investigate musculoskeletal adaptation to underloading (loading below the threshold range) using complete unloading of the hindlimbs via tail suspension,(4) denervation,(5) tendon resection,(6) cast immobilization,(7) and muscle paralysis via botulinum toxin A.(8) However, the musculoskeletal responses to lesser degrees of unloading are still ill defined for lack of a suitable animal model. Thus, fundamental questions regarding the rate, extent, and distribution of disuse-induced bone loss and their dependence on a particular mechanical stimulus level are as yet unanswered. Delineating the relationships between mechanical stimuli and skeletal responses along this unloading continuum is crucial for mitigating deleterious skeletal effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke. Additionally, understanding this association can aid in assessing the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and injury resulting from space exploration in partial gravity environments.(9) To address this gap in knowledge, our group previously developed the partial weight suspension (PWS) system(10) that enables long-term exposure of mice to partial loading while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. We previously implemented this model for one loading condition, 38% weight bearing, and reported bone and muscle atrophy that was less for this partial weight bearing (PWB) condition than prior studies employing tail suspension.(10) However, this work did not explore a range of partial loading levels or compare outcomes directly to a traditional model of unloading, namely hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension. Additionally, gait characterization was incomplete, because only gait kinetics was measured without assessing how PWB might affect gait kinematics. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to employ the PWS model to further explore musculoskeletal adaptation along the continuum of loading between disuse and normal weight bearing. Our primary question was whether variable PWB differentially influences muscle atrophy and bone loss. In particular, we hypothesized there would be a linear relationship between the extent of weight bearing and the degree of bone and muscle loss. In addition, we further characterized the PWS model by studying gait kinematics, systemic stress, and the effect of the harnessing apparatus itself on bone and muscle outcomes.",
    "methods": "Subjects and Methods Overview of study design We exposed adult mice to 21 days of PWB at 20%, 40% and 70% of body weight, or total HLU and measured bone and muscle adaptation using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), micro–computed tomography (μCT), mechanical testing, and muscle mass measurements. Two additional fully loaded groups, one harnessed at 100% weight bearing and another in standard vivarium cages, were included as controls. Separately, we measured gait kinematics at PWB levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% to characterize any adjustments to walking in the PWS system. The protocol was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Loading models PWB Two to 3 days prior to suspension, mice in the PWB groups were placed in a forelimb vest and singly housed in standard vivarium cages for acclimation. On day 0, mice were placed in a two-point PWS rig (Fig. 1A), as described.(10) Briefly, the harness was connected to the mouse in two locations, using a tape wrap at the tail base and a hook on the dorsum of the forelimb vest, and attached through a spring to a wheel with linear freedom along a rail across the top of a cage. The same custom 12-inch-cube cages were used for both PWB and HLU groups. Adjustments to actual weight bearing, or effective mass, were made by threading the spring through its support, thereby changing the length of the spring. Effective mass was measured during stationary standing while harnessed over a scale. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab (A) Partial weight-bearing harness maintains the mouse in a quadrupedal orientation while partially offloading body weight using a spring connected to a support rod via a wheel. Reproduced from J Appl Physiol. 2010;109:350–7. (B) Hindlimb unloading harness suspends the mouse by the tail to prevent the hind paws from touching the ground.HLU HLU animals were suspended by their tail for total unloading of the hindlimbs (Fig. 1B), following the recommendations of Morey-Holton and Globus.(11) Briefly, under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia, wound closure strips were used to tape the tail to a swiveling rig hung from a wheel that ran along a rail across the top of a custom cage. The rig was adjusted such that the animal could not touch its hind paws to the floor, thereby fully unloading the hindlimbs. In the resulting roughly 30-degree head down tilt, forelimb contact with the cage floor was preserved, allowing the animal to move freely about the cage. Effect of PWB on gait Gait characteristics were measured by high-speed video of the contact area of the paw while walking on a motorized transparent treadmill belt (DigiGait; Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA, USA), as described in detail.(12) Following a period of accommodation to the harness, each 12-week-old female BALB/ C mouse (n =5) was tested at a treadmill speed of 14 cm/s at five different weight-bearing levels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) in a random order, then with the forelimb vest alone, and finally with no forelimb vest. Between each test, the mouse was given time to acclimate while walking on the treadmill for about 1 minute. Gait parameters included stride length (cm), swing width (cm), swing duration (% of total stride duration [% stride]), and stance/swing ratio for both the forelimb and hindlimb. Left and right limb measurements were averaged. Effect of PWB on the musculoskeletal system Animals and experimental design One hundred and thirty-one skeletally mature (11 weeks old at start of unloading) female C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week before being assigned by body mass to one of six groups. We subjected four groups to decreased loading: PWB at 20% of body mass (PWB20, n =20), 40% of body mass (PWB40, n =21) or 70% of body mass (PWB70, n =18); or HLU via tail suspension (n =25). We also included two control groups: a 100% weight-bearing group in the PWS harness (PWB100, n =10) to determine the effect of the harness alone, and age-matched mice that were group-housed in standard vivarium cages (CON, n =37). Standard rodent chow and water were provided ad libitum. Body mass was monitored daily for the first 5 days of suspension in HLU and PWB groups. CON mice were weighed twice per week, as were HLU mice after the initial 5 day monitoring period. Body mass measurements were continued daily for PWB groups and adjustments to spring length were made as necessary to match each animal’s effective mass to the desired percentage of its body mass (ie, 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% weight bearing). At the end of the 21-day study, mice were euthanized via carbon dioxide immersion and exsanguinated via cardiac puncture.Bone mineral density by DXA Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body (exclusive of the head) and hindlimb (from femoral neck to ankle) was assessed by DXA (PIXImus II; GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) at baseline and sacrifice.Ex vivo muscle measurements Upon sacrifice, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected bilaterally and wet mass was measured. Right and left muscle masses were averaged and normalized by terminal body mass (mg/g).μCT Left femurs were dissected, cleaned of soft tissue, and wrapped in saline-soaked gauze. Samples were stored frozen at −20°C until scanning. Cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture of the femur were assessed according to published guidelines(13) using high-resolution μCT (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) with a 12-μm isotropic voxel size, as described.(14) Images were acquired at 70 kVp and 114 mA, and 200 ms integration time. Two volumes were analyzed: distal metaphysis (beginning 240 μm from the proximal end of the distal growth plate, extending 1800 μm proximally) and midshaft (beginning at 55% of the bone length, extending 600 μm distally). Gaussian filtration was applied to the grayscale images (σ =1, support =2 for distal metaphysis; σ=0.8, support =1 for midshaft). The trabecular and cortical bone were identified using automated algorithms and segmented using a global threshold of 247 and 672 mg hydroxyapatite (HA)/cm3, respectively, for all scans. Morphological analyses were performed on the binarized images using direct, 3D techniques that do not rely on any assumptions about the underlying structure.(15–17) Morphometric variables of cancellous bone included bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm−1), structure model index (SMI), and degree of anisotropy (DA). Cortical bone morphology measurements included average cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), total cross-sectional area (Tt.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and polar moment of inertia (J, mm4).Mechanical testing Left femurs were mechanically tested to failure in three-point bending. Fresh-frozen femurs were thawed to room temperature then centered longitudinally, with the anterior surface on the two lower support points spaced 10 mm apart.(18) One of two materials testing systems (MTS Bionix 200 with 100 N load cell, MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN, USA; Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell, Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was used to apply a flexion moment in the anterior-posterior plane at a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s until failure. Force-displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz and used to determine maximum force (N), stiffness (N/mm), and estimated Young’s Modulus (MPa). Effect of PWB on adrenocortical activity Following the same experimental design for the study of the effect of PWB on the musculoskeletal system as described above, 34 mice were assigned to the HLU (n =5), PWB20 (n =4), PWB40 (n =5), PWB70 (n =5), PWB100 (n =5), and CON (n =5) groups. An additional control group, CON1, consisting of mice singly-housed in standard vivarium cages (n =5) was included to test for stress induced by single housing. Feces were collected from each individual animal on day 0 (presuspension), and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 days after suspension, except in the case of the CON group from which only one sample per time point could be acquired because of group housing. Cage flooring was cleaned 24 hours before sampling. A 5α-pregnane-3β,11β,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay for measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) was used to measure adrenocortical activity, as described.(19,20) The fecal corticosterone metabolites reflect adrenocortical activity of the prior 24 hours. Statistical analysis All data were checked for normality and reported as mean ± SD, unless otherwise noted. Group differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. We assessed differences in gait parameters with repeated measures ANOVA separately for an effect of the harness (including 100% weight bearing, vest alone, and bare trials only) and effect of loading level (including 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% weight-bearing trials only) stratified by limb (forelimb or hindlimb). No data were collected from 1 mouse with the vest alone due to technical difficulties. Consequently that mouse was eliminated from repeated measures analyses involving that loading condition. For the study of effects on the musculoskeletal system, we tested for group differences in body mass, BMD, and fecal corticosterone levels at baseline among groups using one-way ANOVA. Longitudinal changes in body mass from day 0 were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc testing for pairwise differences. One-sample t tests were used to determine if percent changes in BMD from baseline were different from zero. To test for any differences from the control group, we compared unloaded groups to CON using ANOVA with a two-sided Dunnett’s post hoc analysis. We used ANOVA to determine the effect of unloading level on ex vivo bone and muscle outcomes in the PWB20, PWB40, PWB70, and PWB100 groups, with Scheffé post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. We used two-tailed t tests to determine whether bone and muscle outcomes differed between HLU and PWB20. To test for linear association with weight bearing we used linear regression and confirmed that the residuals were normally distributed with equal variance over the range of expected values. Corticosterone metabolite measurements were averaged for each mouse from days 1 to 3 and from days 5 to 10, and differences among groups for each time point were determined using ANOVA with post hoc testing. Missing data for 1 PWB100 animal on day 8 was filled in by averaging the values for days 5 and 10.",
    "results": "Results Effect of PWB on gait There were no differences in gait parameters among the three 100% loading conditions (harnessed at 100% weight bearing, vest alone, no vest), except for stance width (p =0.03), which was modified with the addition of vest alone (+30% and +6.5%) and harness (+38% and −9.5%) for the forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively (Table 1). As expected due to the design of the forelimb jacket, stance width was more affected at the forelimbs than the hindlimbs. Table 1.

With decreased weight bearing, gait was characterized by a longer swing phase and shorter stance phase (eg, +27% and −10% at 20% PWB relative to 100% weight bearing, respectively), and a concomitant decrease in stance/swing ratio for the hindlimbs only (Table 1). There were no changes in forelimb stride time in swing and stance phases (p >0.2), though there was a trend toward decreased forelimb stride length with partial unloading (p =0.07). Stance width did differ from the 100% weight-bearing (plus harness) condition for either forelimbs or hindlimbs during PWB (p >0.2). Effects of PWB on the musculoskeletal system The unloading interventions were generally well-tolerated. Three mice (2 HLU and 1 PWB20) were removed from the study due to excessive self-inflicted injury at the harness attachment point(s). Body mass Baseline body mass (19.5 ± 1.3 g) did not differ among groups. Body mass declined slightly (less than −2%) in the HLU, PWB20, and PWB40 groups within the first 7 days (p <0.05; Fig. 2). By day 21, body mass returned to baseline levels in the PWB20 and PWB40 groups, but not in the HLU group (−3.7% +4.8%; p <0.005). The PWB70, PWB100, and CON groups gained body mass transiently during the study (+1.5% to 2.7%, p <0.05), but each of these groups concluded the study at their baseline body mass. Fig. 2.

Furthermore, final soleus and gastrocnemius masses were linearly associated with weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.38 and 0.41, respectively; Fig. 4A). Soleus and gastrocnemius muscle mass were 30% and 4% lower (p <0.05), respectively, in HLU than PWB20. Muscle atrophy was greater in the soleus than the gastrocnemius. For example, soleus and gastrocnemius weight were 22% and 10% lower, respectively, in PWB20 compared to PWB100. Fig. 3.

Equations of the best fit line are displayed for linear regressions that were significant and residuals were normally distributed with equal variance over the range of expected values.The PWS harness itself had minimal effects on muscle mass, because soleus wet weight was similar in the PWB100 and CON groups, though gastrocnemius wet weight was slightly lower in PWB100 versus CON (−3.3%, p =0.03).BMD Total body and hindlimb BMD were comparable among all groups at baseline. Total body BMD increased in CON mice (4.7% ± 2.8% versus baseline; p <0.0001), whereas PWB100 controls did not change significantly from baseline (−1.7% ±2.7%, p =0.08 versus baseline; p <0.001 versus CON). Unloading, either by PWB or HLU, led to declines in BMD that were different from CON (Fig. 5). Further, within the PWB groups, the declines in total body BMD were linearly related to weightbearing, with a 0.78% ± 0.1% decrease in BMD for every 10% decrease in percent weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.42; Figs. 4B, 5A). Similar patterns, but greater in magnitude, were seen for the leg region, with a 1.2% ± 0.2% decrease in hindlimb BMD for every 10% decrease in weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.42; Figs. 4B, 5B). BMD declined less in HLU than PWB20 for the total body (−5.7% ± 3.0% versus −7.9% ± 2.7%, p =0.02), but declined similarly at the hindlimb (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5.

As was seen with BMD, in the PWB groups, trabecular bone volume and microarchitecture at the distal femur tended to deteriorate in proportion to the degree of unloading, such that Tb.BV/TV was 27% lower in PWB20 than PWB100 (Table 2, Fig. 6A). Indeed, distal femur Tb.BV/TV was linearly associated with weight-bearing level (R2 =0.20, p <0.0001; Fig. 4C). Specific microarchitectural changes associated with unloading included trabecular thinning resulting in more rod-like, less-aligned trabeculae. With regard to cortical bone morphology, unloading did not impact total bone cross-sectional area, but did lead to significantly lower cortical bone area (−18% to −24%) and a thinner cortex (−15% to −23%) at both the femoral mid-diaphysis and distal metaphyseal regions compared to PWB100 (Table 2, Fig. 6B). Partial unloading also led to significant reduction in polar moment of inertia compared to CON. Cortical area of the femoral midshaft was linearly associated with weight bearing (R2 =0.24, p <0.0001; Fig. 4D). Fig. 6.

For example, at the distal femoral metaphysis, HLU mice had higher Ct.Th, Ct.Ar, and Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar and more plate-like trabecular structure than PWB20 (p <0.008).Femoral bone strength Femoral bone biomechanical properties were similar in CON and PWB100 (Table 3). Maximum force (−19% to −21%) and stiffness (−14% to −20%) were lower in all partially and fully unloaded groups relative to CON (p <0.0001 versus CON; Table 3), but comparable to each other.

    "discussion": "Discussion We investigated the influence of reduced weight bearing on the musculoskeletal system by comparing the bone and muscle adaptation to three levels of PWB with that of HLU and fully weight-bearing controls. We hypothesized that PWB would differentially attenuate muscle atrophy and bone loss as compared to full unloading, and more specifically, that there would be a linear relationship between the percent of weight bearing and degree of bone and muscle loss. Further, we hypothesized that the PWS apparatus itself would have no effect on bone and muscle tissue or gait kinematics. Within the PWB groups, we found a strong dependence of most bone and muscle outcomes on the degree of PWB. Of the variables that were influenced by loading, all decreased monotonically with decreasing weight bearing. Further, calf muscle mass, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, femoral trabecular bone volume, and cortical bone area met statistical criteria to be linearly related to weightbearing. For the longitudinal measurements (total body and hindlimb BMD) approximately 40% of the variation in bone loss was explained by the level of PWB. Although highly significant, the PWB level explained less of the variation in bone and muscle parameters measured at the end of the study, likely reflecting the interanimal variation at baseline not accounted for by end of study measures. It is not surprising that the PWB level did not explain more of the variation in bone and muscle loss given the rough measure of bone loading that is provided by the static ground reaction forces (eg, PWB level). The variation in bone and muscle outcomes at each weight-bearing level are likely due to the heterogeneous loading experienced by the mice because activity level, and therefore number of strain cycles and total strain stimulus, could not be controlled. We addressed whether the PWS harness alone influenced musculoskeletal outcomes. Whereas most outcomes did not differ between group-housed controls and mice harnessed in the suspension rig but fully loaded to 100% of their body weight, there were minor differences in some parameters. These differences were not observed previously when we used a jacketed, but not harnessed, control.(10) It is possible that the changes we found were brought about by experimental conditions causing disturbances in stress because harnessed mice had higher stress levels than singly-housed mice, but maintained total body mass consistent with the controls. Also, there are other mechanical factors that may have contributed to these observations. First, gait is slightly modified by the addition of a harness, which could alter the mechanical environment of the hindlimb. The gait alterations at 100% weight bearing were minimal, with only a slight increase in stance width during harnessed locomotion relative to control animals. Second, the harness, although providing 100% loading as measured during static weight bearing on a scale, could have affected the animals’ overall physical activity leading to a decrease in total dynamic loading. Third, whenever the animal ventured away from the central axis of the cage, thus stretching the harness, the restoring force of the spring would partially unload the animal relative to its distance from the center. A low spring constant was chosen to minimize this restoring force, estimated to be a maximum of 32% of body weight in the vertical direction at the furthest edge of the cage. Taken altogether, there may have been a systemic or mechanical unloading effect of the harness in the fully weight-bearing control group and results should be interpreted with this in mind. Still, only a few bone and muscle outcomes were altered with the harness and any differences between PWB100 and CON were greatly exceeded by the impact of reduced weight bearing. Comparison of PWB to HLU led to several interesting observations. Muscle atrophy was greater in HLU than PWB20, as expected. However, contrary to our initial hypothesis, hindlimb BMD and microarchitecture of tail suspended animals fared as well or better than those of mice bearing 20% of their body weight. This result was unexpected based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the primary stimulus for musculoskeletal maintenance, the high correlation between muscle and bone measures, and the assumption that mechanical loading is less for HLU mice than PWB20. One possible explanation is that HLU mice were not truly loaded less than PWB20, because the unloaded hindlimb continued to receive stimulation through muscular contractions acting against limb inertia. Future studies should measure strain in the hindlimb during HLU and PWB to verify that strain decreases as predicted. Yet it is paradoxical that HLU mice experienced greater muscle atrophy but maintained higher bone mass than PWB20. This discrepancy between relative changes in bone and muscle evokes an alternative explanation that systemic factors influenced the muscle/bone interactions. Possible systemic factors that may play a role include elevated corticosterone levels and cephalad fluid shift. High glucocorticoid levels are catabolic to both bone and muscle. Based on our measurements of fecal corticosterone metabolites, both PWB20 and HLU groups had elevated adrenocortical activity throughout the experiment, but stress was higher in HLU for the first 3 days and thus is not consistent with lesser bone loss seen in HLU. Cephalad fluid shift is induced by HLU due to the approximately 30-degree head-down tilt, but is not duplicated by PWS. It has been proposed that this fluid shift leads to increased perfusion of the cephalically located skeleton, providing an osteogenic stimulus,(21,22) which may cause the release of anti-catabolic factors systemically. Although speculative, this in turn might offset the skeletal effects of unloading in the hindlimbs while not affecting muscle. Ultimately, we lack a suitable explanation for the discrepant muscle and bone changes with HLU. However, it is certain that hindlimb unloading is not equivalent to 0% PWB; and that the PWB and HLU models are functionally different. The PWS model is well suited to test the tenets proposed in the mechanostat theory. Specifically, the theory asserts the existence of a “lazy zone” in which bone mass does not change over a wide range of normal strain, bounded by a lower threshold of minimum effective strain at 50 to 200 με and an upper threshold of 2000 to 3000 με.2 Therefore, a conservative estimate of the width of the lazy zone is 200 to 2000 με, or in other terms, 18% to 182% of the median strain. However, we saw definitive reductions in bone mass, architecture, and strength with a decrease in weight bearing by as little as 30% (ie, PWB70). For bone remodeling to have occurred, the lower threshold must be higher than 70% of normal weight bearing. Thus the data support a physiologic window of normal strain stimulus (lazy zone) much narrower on the underloading side than that proposed by Frost.(1,2) Furthermore, if it were assumed that the bone changes identified in the skeletons of PWB100 animals resulted from minor reductions in loading, then the lower strain threshold would have to exist very close to normal weight-bearing strain. This is consistent with Lanyon’s hypothesis of bone adaptation(23,24) and is supported by a recent study in which sciatic neurectomized mice received axial loading to different peak loads and resultant bone mass/strength measures were linearly related to peak load, with no evidence of a lazy zone.(25) If this theory were true, extended minor reductions in physical activity would be suggested to cause proportionate degrees of bone loss. Although bed rest has clearly been shown to reduce bone mass, periods of relatively reduced activity, such as that which may occur during hospitalization(26) or winter months,(27) should also be considered as risks to bone health. Then again, it is possible that factors other than strain may have led to slight changes in select outcomes. Further studies should quantify the reduction in loading from PWS harnessing at 100% weight bearing and less to determine the strain threshold below which bone resorption is initiated. The maintenance of normal bone loading patterns, through preserved quadrupedal gait kinematics, with a reduction in magnitude, through PWB, is an important advantage of this PWB model. In other models that use external loading to modify the mechanical environment, there is a mismatch in strain distribution between normal loading and experimentally applied loading, which often leads to regional variability in effects on bone and complicates interpretation.(25,28,29) The expected preserved strain distribution in this model resolves the problem of not knowing how the experimental loading differs from normal. Thereby, PWB could be a powerful tool in discriminating regional differences in bone’s sensitivity to mechanical signals. This study has several limitations. The PWS harness could be improved by the use of a dual-axis rig that would allow the mouse to move around all areas of the cage with a constant unweighting force. Second, because it is putatively mechanical strain to which bone responds, it would be important to quantify the strains engendered at varying weight-bearing levels to relate bone adaptive changes reported here to alterations in the local mechanical environment. Finally, we investigated only one time point, and future studies involving multiple time points are needed explore the time-dependence of musculoskeletal adaptation. Despite these limitations, we showed that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb. This is the first study with the PWS model to include a concurrent HLU group, allowing for comparison to an established model of disuse-induced loss, and a PWB100 control group, to account for the independent effect of the PWS harness. Finally, we demonstrated that the PWS system is less stressful than HLU by measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites. In conclusion, this study used a partial unloading model that largely preserves normal gait to demonstrate that bone and muscle loss are linearly related to the degree of unloading, as measured by static weight bearing. Using this tunable model we were able to thoroughly describe bone and muscle adaptation for loading magnitudes in the spectrum between total unloading and normal mechanical loading for the first time, and found that even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. The PWB model will be useful for future studies investigating the specific local mechanical signals, systemic hormones, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to disuse-induced bone loss and muscle atrophy.",

Copyright notice ID: 4118556 MSID: MS604860 PMID: 23165526 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Bone Miner Res Abstract Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb. Keywords: MECHANICAL LOADING, DISUSE, MECHANOSTAT, FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATION, WEIGHT BEARINGIntroduction According to Frost’s mechanostat theory,(1,2) bone adapts its structure to maintain the strain engendered by physiological loading within a threshold range. Studies using animal models of overloading (mechanical loading above the threshold range) have allowed further refinement to the mechanostat theory by describing the dependence of bone formation on mechanical parameters such as strain rate, strain frequency, strain magnitude, loading history, daily strain stimulus, and rest insertion.(3) Animal studies have also been used to investigate musculoskeletal adaptation to underloading (loading below the threshold range) using complete unloading of the hindlimbs via tail suspension,(4) denervation,(5) tendon resection,(6) cast immobilization,(7) and muscle paralysis via botulinum toxin A.(8) However, the musculoskeletal responses to lesser degrees of unloading are still ill defined for lack of a suitable animal model. Thus, fundamental questions regarding the rate, extent, and distribution of disuse-induced bone loss and their dependence on a particular mechanical stimulus level are as yet unanswered. Delineating the relationships between mechanical stimuli and skeletal responses along this unloading continuum is crucial for mitigating deleterious skeletal effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and stroke. Additionally, understanding this association can aid in assessing the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and injury resulting from space exploration in partial gravity environments.(9) To address this gap in knowledge, our group previously developed the partial weight suspension (PWS) system(10) that enables long-term exposure of mice to partial loading while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. We previously implemented this model for one loading condition, 38% weight bearing, and reported bone and muscle atrophy that was less for this partial weight bearing (PWB) condition than prior studies employing tail suspension.(10) However, this work did not explore a range of partial loading levels or compare outcomes directly to a traditional model of unloading, namely hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension. Additionally, gait characterization was incomplete, because only gait kinetics was measured without assessing how PWB might affect gait kinematics. Thus, the overall goal of this study was to employ the PWS model to further explore musculoskeletal adaptation along the continuum of loading between disuse and normal weight bearing. Our primary question was whether variable PWB differentially influences muscle atrophy and bone loss. In particular, we hypothesized there would be a linear relationship between the extent of weight bearing and the degree of bone and muscle loss. In addition, we further characterized the PWS model by studying gait kinematics, systemic stress, and the effect of the harnessing apparatus itself on bone and muscle outcomes.Subjects and Methods Overview of study design We exposed adult mice to 21 days of PWB at 20%, 40% and 70% of body weight, or total HLU and measured bone and muscle adaptation using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), micro–computed tomography (μCT), mechanical testing, and muscle mass measurements. Two additional fully loaded groups, one harnessed at 100% weight bearing and another in standard vivarium cages, were included as controls. Separately, we measured gait kinematics at PWB levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% to characterize any adjustments to walking in the PWS system. The protocol was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Loading models PWB Two to 3 days prior to suspension, mice in the PWB groups were placed in a forelimb vest and singly housed in standard vivarium cages for acclimation. On day 0, mice were placed in a two-point PWS rig (Fig. 1A), as described.(10) Briefly, the harness was connected to the mouse in two locations, using a tape wrap at the tail base and a hook on the dorsum of the forelimb vest, and attached through a spring to a wheel with linear freedom along a rail across the top of a cage. The same custom 12-inch-cube cages were used for both PWB and HLU groups. Adjustments to actual weight bearing, or effective mass, were made by threading the spring through its support, thereby changing the length of the spring. Effective mass was measured during stationary standing while harnessed over a scale. Fig. 1.

Reproduced from J Appl Physiol. 2010;109:350–7. (B) Hindlimb unloading harness suspends the mouse by the tail to prevent the hind paws from touching the ground.HLU HLU animals were suspended by their tail for total unloading of the hindlimbs (Fig. 1B), following the recommendations of Morey-Holton and Globus.(11) Briefly, under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia, wound closure strips were used to tape the tail to a swiveling rig hung from a wheel that ran along a rail across the top of a custom cage. The rig was adjusted such that the animal could not touch its hind paws to the floor, thereby fully unloading the hindlimbs. In the resulting roughly 30-degree head down tilt, forelimb contact with the cage floor was preserved, allowing the animal to move freely about the cage.Effect of PWB on gait Gait characteristics were measured by high-speed video of the contact area of the paw while walking on a motorized transparent treadmill belt (DigiGait; Mouse Specifics, Quincy, MA, USA), as described in detail.(12) Following a period of accommodation to the harness, each 12-week-old female BALB/ C mouse (n =5) was tested at a treadmill speed of 14 cm/s at five different weight-bearing levels (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) in a random order, then with the forelimb vest alone, and finally with no forelimb vest. Between each test, the mouse was given time to acclimate while walking on the treadmill for about 1 minute. Gait parameters included stride length (cm), swing width (cm), swing duration (% of total stride duration [% stride]), and stance/swing ratio for both the forelimb and hindlimb. Left and right limb measurements were averaged.Effect of PWB on the musculoskeletal system Animals and experimental design One hundred and thirty-one skeletally mature (11 weeks old at start of unloading) female C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week before being assigned by body mass to one of six groups. We subjected four groups to decreased loading: PWB at 20% of body mass (PWB20, n =20), 40% of body mass (PWB40, n =21) or 70% of body mass (PWB70, n =18); or HLU via tail suspension (n =25). We also included two control groups: a 100% weight-bearing group in the PWS harness (PWB100, n =10) to determine the effect of the harness alone, and age-matched mice that were group-housed in standard vivarium cages (CON, n =37). Standard rodent chow and water were provided ad libitum. Body mass was monitored daily for the first 5 days of suspension in HLU and PWB groups. CON mice were weighed twice per week, as were HLU mice after the initial 5 day monitoring period. Body mass measurements were continued daily for PWB groups and adjustments to spring length were made as necessary to match each animal’s effective mass to the desired percentage of its body mass (ie, 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% weight bearing). At the end of the 21-day study, mice were euthanized via carbon dioxide immersion and exsanguinated via cardiac puncture.Bone mineral density by DXA Bone mineral density (BMD) of the total body (exclusive of the head) and hindlimb (from femoral neck to ankle) was assessed by DXA (PIXImus II; GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) at baseline and sacrifice.Ex vivo muscle measurements Upon sacrifice, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected bilaterally and wet mass was measured. Right and left muscle masses were averaged and normalized by terminal body mass (mg/g).μCT Left femurs were dissected, cleaned of soft tissue, and wrapped in saline-soaked gauze. Samples were stored frozen at −20°C until scanning. Cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture of the femur were assessed according to published guidelines(13) using high-resolution μCT (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) with a 12-μm isotropic voxel size, as described.(14) Images were acquired at 70 kVp and 114 mA, and 200 ms integration time. Two volumes were analyzed: distal metaphysis (beginning 240 μm from the proximal end of the distal growth plate, extending 1800 μm proximally) and midshaft (beginning at 55% of the bone length, extending 600 μm distally). Gaussian filtration was applied to the grayscale images (σ =1, support =2 for distal metaphysis; σ=0.8, support =1 for midshaft). The trabecular and cortical bone were identified using automated algorithms and segmented using a global threshold of 247 and 672 mg hydroxyapatite (HA)/cm3, respectively, for all scans. Morphological analyses were performed on the binarized images using direct, 3D techniques that do not rely on any assumptions about the underlying structure.(15–17) Morphometric variables of cancellous bone included bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, mm−1), structure model index (SMI), and degree of anisotropy (DA). Cortical bone morphology measurements included average cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), total cross-sectional area (Tt.Ar, mm2), cortical bone area (Ct.Ar, mm2), cortical area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), and polar moment of inertia (J, mm4).Mechanical testing Left femurs were mechanically tested to failure in three-point bending. Fresh-frozen femurs were thawed to room temperature then centered longitudinally, with the anterior surface on the two lower support points spaced 10 mm apart.(18) One of two materials testing systems (MTS Bionix 200 with 100 N load cell, MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN, USA; Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell, Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was used to apply a flexion moment in the anterior-posterior plane at a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s until failure. Force-displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz and used to determine maximum force (N), stiffness (N/mm), and estimated Young’s Modulus (MPa).Effect of PWB on adrenocortical activity Following the same experimental design for the study of the effect of PWB on the musculoskeletal system as described above, 34 mice were assigned to the HLU (n =5), PWB20 (n =4), PWB40 (n =5), PWB70 (n =5), PWB100 (n =5), and CON (n =5) groups. An additional control group, CON1, consisting of mice singly-housed in standard vivarium cages (n =5) was included to test for stress induced by single housing. Feces were collected from each individual animal on day 0 (presuspension), and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 days after suspension, except in the case of the CON group from which only one sample per time point could be acquired because of group housing. Cage flooring was cleaned 24 hours before sampling. A 5α-pregnane-3β,11β,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay for measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) was used to measure adrenocortical activity, as described.(19,20) The fecal corticosterone metabolites reflect adrenocortical activity of the prior 24 hours.Statistical analysis All data were checked for normality and reported as mean ± SD, unless otherwise noted. Group differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. We assessed differences in gait parameters with repeated measures ANOVA separately for an effect of the harness (including 100% weight bearing, vest alone, and bare trials only) and effect of loading level (including 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% weight-bearing trials only) stratified by limb (forelimb or hindlimb). No data were collected from 1 mouse with the vest alone due to technical difficulties. Consequently that mouse was eliminated from repeated measures analyses involving that loading condition. For the study of effects on the musculoskeletal system, we tested for group differences in body mass, BMD, and fecal corticosterone levels at baseline among groups using one-way ANOVA. Longitudinal changes in body mass from day 0 were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc testing for pairwise differences. One-sample t tests were used to determine if percent changes in BMD from baseline were different from zero. To test for any differences from the control group, we compared unloaded groups to CON using ANOVA with a two-sided Dunnett’s post hoc analysis. We used ANOVA to determine the effect of unloading level on ex vivo bone and muscle outcomes in the PWB20, PWB40, PWB70, and PWB100 groups, with Scheffé post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons. We used two-tailed t tests to determine whether bone and muscle outcomes differed between HLU and PWB20. To test for linear association with weight bearing we used linear regression and confirmed that the residuals were normally distributed with equal variance over the range of expected values. Corticosterone metabolite measurements were averaged for each mouse from days 1 to 3 and from days 5 to 10, and differences among groups for each time point were determined using ANOVA with post hoc testing. Missing data for 1 PWB100 animal on day 8 was filled in by averaging the values for days 5 and 10.Results Effect of PWB on gait There were no differences in gait parameters among the three 100% loading conditions (harnessed at 100% weight bearing, vest alone, no vest), except for stance width (p =0.03), which was modified with the addition of vest alone (+30% and +6.5%) and harness (+38% and −9.5%) for the forelimbs and hindlimbs, respectively (Table 1). As expected due to the design of the forelimb jacket, stance width was more affected at the forelimbs than the hindlimbs. Table 1.

With decreased weight bearing, gait was characterized by a longer swing phase and shorter stance phase (eg, +27% and −10% at 20% PWB relative to 100% weight bearing, respectively), and a concomitant decrease in stance/swing ratio for the hindlimbs only (Table 1). There were no changes in forelimb stride time in swing and stance phases (p >0.2), though there was a trend toward decreased forelimb stride length with partial unloading (p =0.07). Stance width did differ from the 100% weight-bearing (plus harness) condition for either forelimbs or hindlimbs during PWB (p >0.2).Effects of PWB on the musculoskeletal system The unloading interventions were generally well-tolerated. Three mice (2 HLU and 1 PWB20) were removed from the study due to excessive self-inflicted injury at the harness attachment point(s). Body mass Baseline body mass (19.5 ± 1.3 g) did not differ among groups. Body mass declined slightly (less than −2%) in the HLU, PWB20, and PWB40 groups within the first 7 days (p <0.05; Fig. 2). By day 21, body mass returned to baseline levels in the PWB20 and PWB40 groups, but not in the HLU group (−3.7% +4.8%; p <0.005). The PWB70, PWB100, and CON groups gained body mass transiently during the study (+1.5% to 2.7%, p <0.05), but each of these groups concluded the study at their baseline body mass. Fig. 2.

Asterisk denotes significant difference (p <0.005) from baseline at day 21.Muscle mass Compared to the CON and PWB100 groups, muscle weights were significantly lower in all partially unloaded groups (ie, PWB20, PWB40, PWB70; p <0.05 for all; Fig. 3). Furthermore, final soleus and gastrocnemius masses were linearly associated with weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.38 and 0.41, respectively; Fig. 4A). Soleus and gastrocnemius muscle mass were 30% and 4% lower (p <0.05), respectively, in HLU than PWB20. Muscle atrophy was greater in the soleus than the gastrocnemius. For example, soleus and gastrocnemius weight were 22% and 10% lower, respectively, in PWB20 compared to PWB100. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab (A) Soleus and (B) gastrocnemius wet mass normalized by body mass (mean ±SEM). * =Different from CON (p <0.05), # =HLU different from PWB20, PWB40, PWB70, and PWB100 (p <0.05), brackets =pairwise differences between PWB groups (ANOVA with Scheffé post hoc, p <0.05).Fig. 4.

(C) Trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and thickness of the distal femur. (D) Cortical area and thickness of the femur midshaft. Equations of the best fit line are displayed for linear regressions that were significant and residuals were normally distributed with equal variance over the range of expected values.The PWS harness itself had minimal effects on muscle mass, because soleus wet weight was similar in the PWB100 and CON groups, though gastrocnemius wet weight was slightly lower in PWB100 versus CON (−3.3%, p =0.03).BMD Total body and hindlimb BMD were comparable among all groups at baseline. Total body BMD increased in CON mice (4.7% ± 2.8% versus baseline; p <0.0001), whereas PWB100 controls did not change significantly from baseline (−1.7% ±2.7%, p =0.08 versus baseline; p <0.001 versus CON). Unloading, either by PWB or HLU, led to declines in BMD that were different from CON (Fig. 5). Further, within the PWB groups, the declines in total body BMD were linearly related to weightbearing, with a 0.78% ± 0.1% decrease in BMD for every 10% decrease in percent weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.42; Figs. 4B, 5A). Similar patterns, but greater in magnitude, were seen for the leg region, with a 1.2% ± 0.2% decrease in hindlimb BMD for every 10% decrease in weight bearing (p <0.0001, R2 =0.42; Figs. 4B, 5B). BMD declined less in HLU than PWB20 for the total body (−5.7% ± 3.0% versus −7.9% ± 2.7%, p =0.02), but declined similarly at the hindlimb (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5.

As was seen with BMD, in the PWB groups, trabecular bone volume and microarchitecture at the distal femur tended to deteriorate in proportion to the degree of unloading, such that Tb.BV/TV was 27% lower in PWB20 than PWB100 (Table 2, Fig. 6A). Indeed, distal femur Tb.BV/TV was linearly associated with weight-bearing level (R2 =0.20, p <0.0001; Fig. 4C). Specific microarchitectural changes associated with unloading included trabecular thinning resulting in more rod-like, less-aligned trabeculae. With regard to cortical bone morphology, unloading did not impact total bone cross-sectional area, but did lead to significantly lower cortical bone area (−18% to −24%) and a thinner cortex (−15% to −23%) at both the femoral mid-diaphysis and distal metaphyseal regions compared to PWB100 (Table 2, Fig. 6B). Partial unloading also led to significant reduction in polar moment of inertia compared to CON. Cortical area of the femoral midshaft was linearly associated with weight bearing (R2 =0.24, p <0.0001; Fig. 4D). Fig. 6.

For example, at the distal femoral metaphysis, HLU mice had higher Ct.Th, Ct.Ar, and Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar and more plate-like trabecular structure than PWB20 (p <0.008).Femoral bone strength Femoral bone biomechanical properties were similar in CON and PWB100 (Table 3). Maximum force (−19% to −21%) and stiffness (−14% to −20%) were lower in all partially and fully unloaded groups relative to CON (p <0.0001 versus CON; Table 3), but comparable to each other.

Effects of PWB on adrenocortical activity All groups had the same baseline level of fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM). CON1, the mice singly housed in standard cages, had the lowest FCM levels for the duration of the experiment though we could not determine if this was significantly less than the group-housed CON due to the single CON measurement at each time point (Fig. 7). All HLU and PWB groups had higher FCM levels than CON1 throughout the study (p <0.05). Further, for days 1 to 3, FCM levels in HLU were higher than all PWB groups (p <0.05). For days 5 to 10, FCM levels in HLU decreased to the same level as those in PWB20, PWB40, and PWB100, but remained significantly higher than PWB70 (p <0.05). All PWB groups had the same measured FCM levels for both time blocks, except concentrations in PWB20 were higher than PWB70 and PWB100 on days 5 to 10 (p <0.05). Fig. 7.

We hypothesized that PWB would differentially attenuate muscle atrophy and bone loss as compared to full unloading, and more specifically, that there would be a linear relationship between the percent of weight bearing and degree of bone and muscle loss. Further, we hypothesized that the PWS apparatus itself would have no effect on bone and muscle tissue or gait kinematics. Within the PWB groups, we found a strong dependence of most bone and muscle outcomes on the degree of PWB. Of the variables that were influenced by loading, all decreased monotonically with decreasing weight bearing. Further, calf muscle mass, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, femoral trabecular bone volume, and cortical bone area met statistical criteria to be linearly related to weightbearing. For the longitudinal measurements (total body and hindlimb BMD) approximately 40% of the variation in bone loss was explained by the level of PWB. Although highly significant, the PWB level explained less of the variation in bone and muscle parameters measured at the end of the study, likely reflecting the interanimal variation at baseline not accounted for by end of study measures. It is not surprising that the PWB level did not explain more of the variation in bone and muscle loss given the rough measure of bone loading that is provided by the static ground reaction forces (eg, PWB level). The variation in bone and muscle outcomes at each weight-bearing level are likely due to the heterogeneous loading experienced by the mice because activity level, and therefore number of strain cycles and total strain stimulus, could not be controlled. We addressed whether the PWS harness alone influenced musculoskeletal outcomes. Whereas most outcomes did not differ between group-housed controls and mice harnessed in the suspension rig but fully loaded to 100% of their body weight, there were minor differences in some parameters. These differences were not observed previously when we used a jacketed, but not harnessed, control.(10) It is possible that the changes we found were brought about by experimental conditions causing disturbances in stress because harnessed mice had higher stress levels than singly-housed mice, but maintained total body mass consistent with the controls. Also, there are other mechanical factors that may have contributed to these observations. First, gait is slightly modified by the addition of a harness, which could alter the mechanical environment of the hindlimb. The gait alterations at 100% weight bearing were minimal, with only a slight increase in stance width during harnessed locomotion relative to control animals. Second, the harness, although providing 100% loading as measured during static weight bearing on a scale, could have affected the animals’ overall physical activity leading to a decrease in total dynamic loading. Third, whenever the animal ventured away from the central axis of the cage, thus stretching the harness, the restoring force of the spring would partially unload the animal relative to its distance from the center. A low spring constant was chosen to minimize this restoring force, estimated to be a maximum of 32% of body weight in the vertical direction at the furthest edge of the cage. Taken altogether, there may have been a systemic or mechanical unloading effect of the harness in the fully weight-bearing control group and results should be interpreted with this in mind. Still, only a few bone and muscle outcomes were altered with the harness and any differences between PWB100 and CON were greatly exceeded by the impact of reduced weight bearing. Comparison of PWB to HLU led to several interesting observations. Muscle atrophy was greater in HLU than PWB20, as expected. However, contrary to our initial hypothesis, hindlimb BMD and microarchitecture of tail suspended animals fared as well or better than those of mice bearing 20% of their body weight. This result was unexpected based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the primary stimulus for musculoskeletal maintenance, the high correlation between muscle and bone measures, and the assumption that mechanical loading is less for HLU mice than PWB20. One possible explanation is that HLU mice were not truly loaded less than PWB20, because the unloaded hindlimb continued to receive stimulation through muscular contractions acting against limb inertia. Future studies should measure strain in the hindlimb during HLU and PWB to verify that strain decreases as predicted. Yet it is paradoxical that HLU mice experienced greater muscle atrophy but maintained higher bone mass than PWB20. This discrepancy between relative changes in bone and muscle evokes an alternative explanation that systemic factors influenced the muscle/bone interactions. Possible systemic factors that may play a role include elevated corticosterone levels and cephalad fluid shift. High glucocorticoid levels are catabolic to both bone and muscle. Based on our measurements of fecal corticosterone metabolites, both PWB20 and HLU groups had elevated adrenocortical activity throughout the experiment, but stress was higher in HLU for the first 3 days and thus is not consistent with lesser bone loss seen in HLU. Cephalad fluid shift is induced by HLU due to the approximately 30-degree head-down tilt, but is not duplicated by PWS. It has been proposed that this fluid shift leads to increased perfusion of the cephalically located skeleton, providing an osteogenic stimulus,(21,22) which may cause the release of anti-catabolic factors systemically. Although speculative, this in turn might offset the skeletal effects of unloading in the hindlimbs while not affecting muscle. Ultimately, we lack a suitable explanation for the discrepant muscle and bone changes with HLU. However, it is certain that hindlimb unloading is not equivalent to 0% PWB; and that the PWB and HLU models are functionally different. The PWS model is well suited to test the tenets proposed in the mechanostat theory. Specifically, the theory asserts the existence of a “lazy zone” in which bone mass does not change over a wide range of normal strain, bounded by a lower threshold of minimum effective strain at 50 to 200 με and an upper threshold of 2000 to 3000 με.2 Therefore, a conservative estimate of the width of the lazy zone is 200 to 2000 με, or in other terms, 18% to 182% of the median strain. However, we saw definitive reductions in bone mass, architecture, and strength with a decrease in weight bearing by as little as 30% (ie, PWB70). For bone remodeling to have occurred, the lower threshold must be higher than 70% of normal weight bearing. Thus the data support a physiologic window of normal strain stimulus (lazy zone) much narrower on the underloading side than that proposed by Frost.(1,2) Furthermore, if it were assumed that the bone changes identified in the skeletons of PWB100 animals resulted from minor reductions in loading, then the lower strain threshold would have to exist very close to normal weight-bearing strain. This is consistent with Lanyon’s hypothesis of bone adaptation(23,24) and is supported by a recent study in which sciatic neurectomized mice received axial loading to different peak loads and resultant bone mass/strength measures were linearly related to peak load, with no evidence of a lazy zone.(25) If this theory were true, extended minor reductions in physical activity would be suggested to cause proportionate degrees of bone loss. Although bed rest has clearly been shown to reduce bone mass, periods of relatively reduced activity, such as that which may occur during hospitalization(26) or winter months,(27) should also be considered as risks to bone health. Then again, it is possible that factors other than strain may have led to slight changes in select outcomes. Further studies should quantify the reduction in loading from PWS harnessing at 100% weight bearing and less to determine the strain threshold below which bone resorption is initiated. The maintenance of normal bone loading patterns, through preserved quadrupedal gait kinematics, with a reduction in magnitude, through PWB, is an important advantage of this PWB model. In other models that use external loading to modify the mechanical environment, there is a mismatch in strain distribution between normal loading and experimentally applied loading, which often leads to regional variability in effects on bone and complicates interpretation.(25,28,29) The expected preserved strain distribution in this model resolves the problem of not knowing how the experimental loading differs from normal. Thereby, PWB could be a powerful tool in discriminating regional differences in bone’s sensitivity to mechanical signals. This study has several limitations. The PWS harness could be improved by the use of a dual-axis rig that would allow the mouse to move around all areas of the cage with a constant unweighting force. Second, because it is putatively mechanical strain to which bone responds, it would be important to quantify the strains engendered at varying weight-bearing levels to relate bone adaptive changes reported here to alterations in the local mechanical environment. Finally, we investigated only one time point, and future studies involving multiple time points are needed explore the time-dependence of musculoskeletal adaptation. Despite these limitations, we showed that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb. This is the first study with the PWS model to include a concurrent HLU group, allowing for comparison to an established model of disuse-induced loss, and a PWB100 control group, to account for the independent effect of the PWS harness. Finally, we demonstrated that the PWS system is less stressful than HLU by measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites. In conclusion, this study used a partial unloading model that largely preserves normal gait to demonstrate that bone and muscle loss are linearly related to the degree of unloading, as measured by static weight bearing. Using this tunable model we were able to thoroughly describe bone and muscle adaptation for loading magnitudes in the spectrum between total unloading and normal mechanical loading for the first time, and found that even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. The PWB model will be useful for future studies investigating the specific local mechanical signals, systemic hormones, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to disuse-induced bone loss and muscle atrophy.Acknowledgments This work was supported by  R21 AR057522, NASA NNX10AE39G, and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute through NASA NCC 9-58.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight or hind limb unloading.Methods In the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle (STS-135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. In the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 additional mice served as controls. EIM measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle. Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements of the hindlimb were also performed.Results Reductions in the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed for both the space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013); for control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) for spaceflight and hind limb aBMD (ρ=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups.Conclusions These data support the concept that EIM may serve as a useful tool for assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.Keywords: Muscle, Spaceflight, Hind Limb Unloading, Disuse, Electrical Impedance",
    "introduction": "Introduction Exposure to prolonged disuse or microgravity produces a variety of effects on skeletal muscle, including fiber atrophy, a reduction in maximal force, and reduced endurance1. For example, given the major alterations that can ensue even after just several days of exposure to microgravity, human spaceflight currently requires astronauts to participate in daily exercise countermeasures to help offset the effects of weightlessness2. Although a recent report suggests that high intensity exercise combined with optimal nutrition may mitigate bone and muscle loss3, novel approaches to reduce negative effects of spaceflight or prolonged bed rest/immobilization on musculoskeletal health, including drug therapies, are being sought4,5. Diagnostic tools for the assessment of muscle and bone loss due to disuse or weightlessness are, however, quite limited. Standard methods used to evaluate these changes such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography6,7 are expensive and inconvenient for regular clinical use. Moreover, they are not feasible in spaceflight, given the size, weight, and power requirements of the equipment. Ultrasound is being studied for muscle loss assessment in spaceflight, but quantifying the measurements requires substantial procedural modification8. Simple force-testing dynamometers are inconvenient and inaccurate to use on debilitated patients and are virtually impossible to use in space. For these reasons, other non-invasive approaches that can be applied easily and rapidly to both patients and astronauts are of interest. One approach that offers potential value is electrical impedance myography (EIM). EIM is a technique in which a high-frequency, low-energy electrical current is applied to a localized area of muscle and the resulting surface voltages are measured9. EIM is a specialized version of methods developed in the well-studied field of bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy, in which alterations in the characteristics of a tissue or cellular suspension are characterized by the their electrical frequency-dependent properties10-13. In addition to these non-muscular studies, at least one investigation has evaluated the specific relationship between muscle cell size and bioimpedance parameters in tissue culture14. Since the EIM technique is painless, rapid to apply, non-invasive, and the equipment lightweight, it has the potential to serve as a useful method for monitoring muscle status. Earlier studies have shown that surface EIM alterations are closely tied to muscle fiber size15. Importantly, data in humans16 and in rats17 support that EIM is sensitive to changes in muscle following disuse, with reductions in EIM parameters of greater than 30% from baseline, and thus may also have the potential to sensitively identify the impact of disuse or microgravity on muscle health. Here we further explore the potential application of EIM for the assessment of muscle impacted by disuse by studying ex vivo muscle obtained from mice exposed to reduced mechanical loading via hind limb unloading (HLU) or spaceflight, testing the basic hypothesis that such disuse will consistently alter EIM values.",

    "results": "Results Muscle mass As anticipated, mice exposed to spaceflight had a lower gastrocnemius muscle mass than ground controls, although the difference did not reach significance (102±32 mg for spaceflight; 112±22 mg for ground p=0.079). However, mice exposed to HLU had lower muscle mass as compared to controls (95.2±19 mg for HLU; 107±29 mg for control; p=0.0053). Muscle fiber size (spaceflight only) Muscle histology measurements were obtained only in the spaceflight animals and their controls. As anticipated, mice exposed to spaceflight had a smaller average muscle fiber cross-sectional area of 1579±194 μm2 as compared to 2591±197 μm2 in controls (p=0.013) (Figure 3 (a)). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (a). Column plot of average muscle fiber size in ground vs. space flight mice. (b) Scatter plot correlating phase-slope and average muscle fiber size in ground and space flight mice. Electrical Impedance data and muscle characteristics The EIM phase-slope parameter was significantly lower in both the spaceflight and HLU mice when compared to their respective control groups (Figure 4). For control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014); for ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013). We observed a moderate positive relationship between muscle mass and the EIM phase-slope parameter in the HLU study (ρ=0.64, p<0.001), and although the relationship had a similar pattern in the spaceflight study, the association was weaker and did not reach statistical significance (ρ=0.39, p=0.17) (Figure 5). This inconsistency may relate to the fact that there were considerably smaller number of spaceflight animals and that muscle mass was slightly lower in the HLU group than the spaceflight group compared to their respective control groups. However, there was a good correlation between muscle fiber size and the phase-slope parameter (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) across the spaceflight and ground control animals (Figure 3 (b)). Figure 4.

Areal Bone Mineral Density and Electrical Impedance As expected, both spaceflight and HLU groups had significantly lower hind limb aBMD compared to controls. For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 55.9±0.80 × 10-3 g/cm2 and 50.8±0.56 × 10-3 g/cm2, respectively (p=0.0013). For control and HLU groups, the values were 52.6±0.55 × 10-3 g/cm2 and 47.1±0.44 × 10-3 g/cm2, respectively (p<0.001). In both studies, there were significant correlations between hind limb aBMD and the phase-slope parameter, both assessed using aBMD and EIM values obtained at the end of the study (HLU study: ρ=0.55, p=0.0031 and space flight study: ρ=0.65, p=0.0063, Figure 6).

    "discussion": "Discussion These results support the hypothesis that significant alterations in the electrical impedance of mouse muscle occur after exposure to both spaceflight and hind limb unloading, consistent with our earlier in vivo observations seen in humans following disuse due to casting16 and rats undergoing hind limb unloading17. Moreover, these EIM alterations correlate with muscle fiber size and also to hind limb aBMD. The consistency of the majority of these results in the two separate experiments supports their authenticity. Thus, the EIM changes observed here likely reflect true alterations to the composition and structure of the muscle tissue itself, including reductions in muscle fiber size and possibly the deposition of connective tissue23. The major outcome measure we have utilized here, the phase-slope, as its derivation described in Figure 2 shows, is a measure of the frequency-dependence of the impedance21. Muscle can be modeled as a complex network of resistors and capacitors24. At these frequencies of applied current, the extracellular space serves as the major resistive component and the sarcolemma of the cell membranes serves as the major capacitive component. The resulting voltages from such complex circuits are typically very sensitive to current frequency and thus even subtle alterations in the structure and composition of the tissue are likely to be observed as shifts in the phase-slope measurement. The phase itself represents a combination of both the resistive and reactive elements in the circuit and has been shown to be very sensitive to a variety of neuromuscular diseases as well as to disuse atrophy16,21,25,26. Taken together, the changes in the phase-slope measure likely represent a reduction in overall surface area of sarcolemmal membrane due to reduced muscle fiber area, as supported by our quantitative microscopy data. Such reduced fiber area would likely be associated with reduced muscle contractile force and power27. Importantly, the alterations observed in the EIM data correlated with meaningful and potentially important measures, including muscle fiber size and, very preliminarily, hind limb aBMD. Previous studies have already identified EIM data correlating significantly to muscle fiber size in rats, in both sciatic crush and HLU models15,17. However, this is the first time that a relationship between EIM and aBMD has been suggested. Since muscle contractions provide much of the mechanical loading experienced by bone, and prior studies have shown associations between muscle mass and aBMD28, it is perhaps not surprising that calf muscle EIM measurements correlate with leg aBMD. Longitudinal measurements of muscle mass, EIM, and bone mass would allow a better understanding of the temporal relationship between bone and muscle changes in response to disuse. The gastrocnemius was studied in these two experiments. Previous studies have shown that in rodents, type 1 muscle fibers tend to atrophy more than type 2 fibers during spaceflight29,30. Thus, the soleus, which consists mainly of type 1 fibers, generally shows greater alteration than the gastrocnemius which mostly consists of type 2 fibers31. Still, some alteration in the gastrocnemius muscle does occur, and it is reassuring that measurement of this less affected muscle still identified a change following disuse. The soleus was not studied for two major reasons. First, the soleus from the spaceflight experiment was not available to this group of researchers. Second, the mouse soleus is considerably smaller than the gastrocnemius and would have been technically challenging to work with and measure ex vivo in the impedance measurement cell even had it been available. There are several limitations to this study worth highlighting, most of which relate to the study design. First, no in vivo EIM measurements were made. One of the potentially most important aspects of EIM is its ability to measure and quantify muscle health rapidly and non-invasively. Thus, it would be valuable to monitor in vivo surface EIM change longitudinally, as was done in the study on rats17, and to correlate in vivo EIM data with in vivo bone mass data, as well as to ex vivo muscle histology and bone microarchitecture. Second, we did not perform any functional testing of the muscle unit or muscle fibers, which would have allowed us to relate dynamic changes to the EIM data. Third, the impedance-measuring device used here (the Imp SFB7® from Impedimed, Inc) is limited in that it is not specifically designed for this use, having been developed for whole-body bioimpedance analysis measurements. It is likely that a dedicated muscle impedance-measuring device would have offered even greater sensitivity to these changes. Fourth, it is possible that the DXA measurements were impacted by the muscle loss to some extent; ideally, qCT measurements would have been performed to more accurately assess bone mineral density. Finally, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that water shifts or dehydration from prolonged suspension/spaceflight may be contributing to the observed changes in the EIM parameters. Although in both experiments the animals were allowed to locomote normally for a period of time before necropsy, simple shifts in muscle water content could have influenced the EIM results. We do note, however, that other work has shown no evidence of impedance change even with 23% reduction in total body weight over a 48-hour period of water restriction (unpublished results, Rutkove and Li, 2013). In summary, we have identified similar alterations in the electrical impedance of muscle after exposure to either microgravity or hind limb unloading and these alterations correlate with both muscle fiber size (in space flight animals) and hind limb aBMD. These results support the need for further study of EIM technology for use in in vivo monitoring of muscle alteration during spaceflight and other conditions leading to musculoskeletal disuse.",

In the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading (HLU) for 13 days; 13 additional mice served as controls. EIM measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle. Quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measurements of the hindlimb were also performed.Results Reductions in the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed for both the space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013); for control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014). This parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) for spaceflight and hind limb aBMD (ρ=0.65, p=0.0063) for both groups.Conclusions These data support the concept that EIM may serve as a useful tool for assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.Keywords: Muscle, Spaceflight, Hind Limb Unloading, Disuse, Electrical ImpedanceIntroduction Exposure to prolonged disuse or microgravity produces a variety of effects on skeletal muscle, including fiber atrophy, a reduction in maximal force, and reduced endurance1. For example, given the major alterations that can ensue even after just several days of exposure to microgravity, human spaceflight currently requires astronauts to participate in daily exercise countermeasures to help offset the effects of weightlessness2. Although a recent report suggests that high intensity exercise combined with optimal nutrition may mitigate bone and muscle loss3, novel approaches to reduce negative effects of spaceflight or prolonged bed rest/immobilization on musculoskeletal health, including drug therapies, are being sought4,5. Diagnostic tools for the assessment of muscle and bone loss due to disuse or weightlessness are, however, quite limited. Standard methods used to evaluate these changes such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography6,7 are expensive and inconvenient for regular clinical use. Moreover, they are not feasible in spaceflight, given the size, weight, and power requirements of the equipment. Ultrasound is being studied for muscle loss assessment in spaceflight, but quantifying the measurements requires substantial procedural modification8. Simple force-testing dynamometers are inconvenient and inaccurate to use on debilitated patients and are virtually impossible to use in space. For these reasons, other non-invasive approaches that can be applied easily and rapidly to both patients and astronauts are of interest. One approach that offers potential value is electrical impedance myography (EIM). EIM is a technique in which a high-frequency, low-energy electrical current is applied to a localized area of muscle and the resulting surface voltages are measured9. EIM is a specialized version of methods developed in the well-studied field of bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy, in which alterations in the characteristics of a tissue or cellular suspension are characterized by the their electrical frequency-dependent properties10-13. In addition to these non-muscular studies, at least one investigation has evaluated the specific relationship between muscle cell size and bioimpedance parameters in tissue culture14. Since the EIM technique is painless, rapid to apply, non-invasive, and the equipment lightweight, it has the potential to serve as a useful method for monitoring muscle status. Earlier studies have shown that surface EIM alterations are closely tied to muscle fiber size15. Importantly, data in humans16 and in rats17 support that EIM is sensitive to changes in muscle following disuse, with reductions in EIM parameters of greater than 30% from baseline, and thus may also have the potential to sensitively identify the impact of disuse or microgravity on muscle health. Here we further explore the potential application of EIM for the assessment of muscle impacted by disuse by studying ex vivo muscle obtained from mice exposed to reduced mechanical loading via hind limb unloading (HLU) or spaceflight, testing the basic hypothesis that such disuse will consistently alter EIM values.Materials and methods Animals For both the hind limb unloading (HLU) and spaceflight experiments, we used 9-week-old female C57Bl/6N mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). In the HLU cohort, 13 ground control and 14 HLU mice were studied, while in the space flight study, 8 ground control and 6 space flight mice were examined. The HLU protocol was approved by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and the protocol used for the spaceflight study was approved by the ACUC at Kennedy Space Center.Spaceflight study Both spaceflight and ground control animals were maintained on a NASA nutrient-upgraded rodent food bar18 throughout the experiment. Spaceflight animals were sacrificed within approximately 2.5-7.5 hours of the shuttle's completing a 12 day, 18.5 hour flight on board the shuttle Atlantis (STS-135 mission). Flight animals were euthanized and the right gastrocnemius muscle was removed intact. Ground control animals, matched to day 0 body weight and bone parameters of flight mice, were euthanized 2 days later and the gastrocnemius muscle removed in an identical fashion, after an equal length of stay in identical cages to those used on the space shuttle19.Hind Limb Unloading studies In a later experiment, mice of the same strain, sex and age were subjected to HLU for 13 days and compared to concurrent normally-loaded controls20. Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, the tail was taped to a freely rotating harness connected to a wheel that could move along a rod across the center of the cage. The height of the harness was adjusted such that the mouse could not touch its hind paws to the floor. A reloading period of 3 to 6 hours, to match the STS-135 timing, was employed in the HLU group by removing the harness and allowing the mice to ambulate before sacrifice. NASA food bars and water were provided ad libitum.Muscle processing and electrical impedance measurements Excised muscle was immediately weighed and then cut to a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm base with approximately a 0.3 cm height block using a razor blade. The block of muscle tissue was placed in a 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm base impedance-measuring cell (Figure 1), configured with two broad, stainless steel electrodes on two sides for applying electrical current and two needle electrodes positioned on top for measuring voltage, as previously described15. The impedance data were obtained using the Imp SFB7® (Impedimed, San Diego, CA). Reactance (X) and resistance (R) data from 3 to 500 kHz was collected. The muscle was placed such that electrical current would flow across (transversely) to the major muscle fiber direction. While it would have been preferable to also obtain measurements with electrical current flow parallel to the fibers (and thus allowing us to assess the anisotropic characteristics of the tissue), positioning the muscle fibers on end with the metal plate electrodes proved very challenging. A preliminary review of the data showed this latter process to be quite inconsistent, and thus was omitted from any further analysis. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Impedance measuring cell with muscle demonstrating how data was obtained.Muscle histology (obtained on space flight muscle only) Immediately after the EIM data were collected, the muscle was snap-frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. The tissue was then cut into 10 μm slices using a Tissue Tek II cryostat (Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart, IN) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cell measurements were made using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a LUDL motorized stage interfaced with a Dell Optiflex 380 computer running Stereo Investigator (MBF Biosciences, Inc., Williston, VT) software. This software allows a non-biased quantification of fiber sizes. After the investigator sets a series of initial parameters, including the section of tissue from which to choose cells, the system automatically and randomly selects groups of cells to count. Approximately 60 cells were evaluated from each animal. In order to reduce the potential for any bias, the evaluator (AS) was blinded to group designation (i.e., loaded or unloaded) of each section being assessed. Muscle histology was also planned in the HLU animals, but unfortunately the tissue was inadvertently damaged during transport and was unusable for analysis.Bone Mineral Density measurements Areal bone mineral density (aBMD, g/cm2) of the hind limb (from femoral neck to ankle) was assessed by peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA, PIXImus II; GE Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) in vivo immediately prior to sacrifice.Data analysis From the raw EIM data, the phase was calculated via the equation: phase=arctan (reactance/resistance) at each frequency. Due to its being the most promising of the multifrequency EIM parameters from previous work21,22, and especially in our recent work in HLU17 rats, the focus here is on the phase-slope parameter, defined as the slope of the fitted linear regression to phase values from 100 to 500 kHz (see Figure 2 for examples as to how this analysis was performed), expressed as degrees/MHz. Although considerably beyond the 50 kHz measurement, the subject much earlier work, the impedance behavior in this region is generally linear and thus favorable to least squares regression analysis. For simplicity of description, the sign was then flipped (thus the negative values are positive). Further explanation as to the potential significance of this parameter is provided in the discussion. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Plots of the average phase from a hind limb unloaded mouse and spaceflight mouse with controls. Dotted lines depict the method of calculating the 100-500 kHz phase-slope parameter.The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to evaluate for differences between phase-slope, muscle mass, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and areal bone mineral density of the HLU and space flight mice with their respective control groups. Spearman rank-correlation coefficient (ρ) was calculated to determine the relationship between phase-slope and muscle mass, muscle fiber area, and hind limb bone mineral density. All results are given as mean ± standard error; significance was assumed at p<0.05, two-tailed.Results Muscle mass As anticipated, mice exposed to spaceflight had a lower gastrocnemius muscle mass than ground controls, although the difference did not reach significance (102±32 mg for spaceflight; 112±22 mg for ground p=0.079). However, mice exposed to HLU had lower muscle mass as compared to controls (95.2±19 mg for HLU; 107±29 mg for control; p=0.0053).Muscle fiber size (spaceflight only) Muscle histology measurements were obtained only in the spaceflight animals and their controls. As anticipated, mice exposed to spaceflight had a smaller average muscle fiber cross-sectional area of 1579±194 μm2 as compared to 2591±197 μm2 in controls (p=0.013) (Figure 3 (a)). Figure 3. Open in a new tab (a). Column plot of average muscle fiber size in ground vs. space flight mice. (b) Scatter plot correlating phase-slope and average muscle fiber size in ground and space flight mice.Electrical Impedance data and muscle characteristics The EIM phase-slope parameter was significantly lower in both the spaceflight and HLU mice when compared to their respective control groups (Figure 4). For control and HLU groups, the values were 23.9±1.6°/MHz and 19.0±1.0°/MHz, respectively (p=0.014); for ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24.7±1.3°/MHz and 14.1±1.6°/MHz, respectively (p=0.0013). We observed a moderate positive relationship between muscle mass and the EIM phase-slope parameter in the HLU study (ρ=0.64, p<0.001), and although the relationship had a similar pattern in the spaceflight study, the association was weaker and did not reach statistical significance (ρ=0.39, p=0.17) (Figure 5). This inconsistency may relate to the fact that there were considerably smaller number of spaceflight animals and that muscle mass was slightly lower in the HLU group than the spaceflight group compared to their respective control groups. However, there was a good correlation between muscle fiber size and the phase-slope parameter (ρ=0.65, p=0.011) across the spaceflight and ground control animals (Figure 3 (b)). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Column plot depicting the average phase-slope of controls vs. hind limb unloaded mice (a) and ground vs. space flight animals (b).Figure 5. Open in a new tab Scatter plots correlating phase-slope and muscle mass in control and hind limb unloaded mice (a) and control and space flight mice (b).Areal Bone Mineral Density and Electrical Impedance As expected, both spaceflight and HLU groups had significantly lower hind limb aBMD compared to controls. For ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 55.9±0.80 × 10-3 g/cm2 and 50.8±0.56 × 10-3 g/cm2, respectively (p=0.0013). For control and HLU groups, the values were 52.6±0.55 × 10-3 g/cm2 and 47.1±0.44 × 10-3 g/cm2, respectively (p<0.001). In both studies, there were significant correlations between hind limb aBMD and the phase-slope parameter, both assessed using aBMD and EIM values obtained at the end of the study (HLU study: ρ=0.55, p=0.0031 and space flight study: ρ=0.65, p=0.0063, Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Scatter plots correlating phase-slope and areal bone mineral density in control and hind limb unloaded mice (a) and control and space flight mice (b).Discussion These results support the hypothesis that significant alterations in the electrical impedance of mouse muscle occur after exposure to both spaceflight and hind limb unloading, consistent with our earlier in vivo observations seen in humans following disuse due to casting16 and rats undergoing hind limb unloading17. Moreover, these EIM alterations correlate with muscle fiber size and also to hind limb aBMD. The consistency of the majority of these results in the two separate experiments supports their authenticity. Thus, the EIM changes observed here likely reflect true alterations to the composition and structure of the muscle tissue itself, including reductions in muscle fiber size and possibly the deposition of connective tissue23. The major outcome measure we have utilized here, the phase-slope, as its derivation described in Figure 2 shows, is a measure of the frequency-dependence of the impedance21. Muscle can be modeled as a complex network of resistors and capacitors24. At these frequencies of applied current, the extracellular space serves as the major resistive component and the sarcolemma of the cell membranes serves as the major capacitive component. The resulting voltages from such complex circuits are typically very sensitive to current frequency and thus even subtle alterations in the structure and composition of the tissue are likely to be observed as shifts in the phase-slope measurement. The phase itself represents a combination of both the resistive and reactive elements in the circuit and has been shown to be very sensitive to a variety of neuromuscular diseases as well as to disuse atrophy16,21,25,26. Taken together, the changes in the phase-slope measure likely represent a reduction in overall surface area of sarcolemmal membrane due to reduced muscle fiber area, as supported by our quantitative microscopy data. Such reduced fiber area would likely be associated with reduced muscle contractile force and power27. Importantly, the alterations observed in the EIM data correlated with meaningful and potentially important measures, including muscle fiber size and, very preliminarily, hind limb aBMD. Previous studies have already identified EIM data correlating significantly to muscle fiber size in rats, in both sciatic crush and HLU models15,17. However, this is the first time that a relationship between EIM and aBMD has been suggested. Since muscle contractions provide much of the mechanical loading experienced by bone, and prior studies have shown associations between muscle mass and aBMD28, it is perhaps not surprising that calf muscle EIM measurements correlate with leg aBMD. Longitudinal measurements of muscle mass, EIM, and bone mass would allow a better understanding of the temporal relationship between bone and muscle changes in response to disuse. The gastrocnemius was studied in these two experiments. Previous studies have shown that in rodents, type 1 muscle fibers tend to atrophy more than type 2 fibers during spaceflight29,30. Thus, the soleus, which consists mainly of type 1 fibers, generally shows greater alteration than the gastrocnemius which mostly consists of type 2 fibers31. Still, some alteration in the gastrocnemius muscle does occur, and it is reassuring that measurement of this less affected muscle still identified a change following disuse. The soleus was not studied for two major reasons. First, the soleus from the spaceflight experiment was not available to this group of researchers. Second, the mouse soleus is considerably smaller than the gastrocnemius and would have been technically challenging to work with and measure ex vivo in the impedance measurement cell even had it been available. There are several limitations to this study worth highlighting, most of which relate to the study design. First, no in vivo EIM measurements were made. One of the potentially most important aspects of EIM is its ability to measure and quantify muscle health rapidly and non-invasively. Thus, it would be valuable to monitor in vivo surface EIM change longitudinally, as was done in the study on rats17, and to correlate in vivo EIM data with in vivo bone mass data, as well as to ex vivo muscle histology and bone microarchitecture. Second, we did not perform any functional testing of the muscle unit or muscle fibers, which would have allowed us to relate dynamic changes to the EIM data. Third, the impedance-measuring device used here (the Imp SFB7® from Impedimed, Inc) is limited in that it is not specifically designed for this use, having been developed for whole-body bioimpedance analysis measurements. It is likely that a dedicated muscle impedance-measuring device would have offered even greater sensitivity to these changes. Fourth, it is possible that the DXA measurements were impacted by the muscle loss to some extent; ideally, qCT measurements would have been performed to more accurately assess bone mineral density. Finally, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that water shifts or dehydration from prolonged suspension/spaceflight may be contributing to the observed changes in the EIM parameters. Although in both experiments the animals were allowed to locomote normally for a period of time before necropsy, simple shifts in muscle water content could have influenced the EIM results. We do note, however, that other work has shown no evidence of impedance change even with 23% reduction in total body weight over a 48-hour period of water restriction (unpublished results, Rutkove and Li, 2013). In summary, we have identified similar alterations in the electrical impedance of muscle after exposure to either microgravity or hind limb unloading and these alterations correlate with both muscle fiber size (in space flight animals) and hind limb aBMD. These results support the need for further study of EIM technology for use in in vivo monitoring of muscle alteration during spaceflight and other conditions leading to musculoskeletal disuse.Acknowledgments This work was funded by NASA grant NNX10AE39G.

    "title": "Spaceflight Activates Lipotoxic Pathways in Mouse Liver",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6915713/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.

    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight affects several physiological and biochemical processes in astronauts and rodent models. The most reported changes from the space environment are in muscle and bone loss1,2. Several studies also indicate that spaceflight affects components of the immune system, including the distribution and functionality of peripheral leukocytes, and activity of cytokines3. In addition, several decades of spaceflight investigations have eluded that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that happen in microgravity4. Research involving spaceflight and simulated ground-based microgravity studies (i.e. bedrest studies) result in manifestation of similar diseases such as diabetes, sedentary states, and aging4. Insulin resistance is believed to be a key risk factor for fatty liver disease, which is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. To date, little work has been done on other tissues such as liver or pancreas because these tissues are not considered to be at risk for long-term spaceflight missions. However, with the increasing precision of omics technology, the approach to evaluate risk from long space missions may find a new paradigm. For example, liver, a critical organ for mammals, has been largely under-studied in the context of spaceflight environment. It performs array of functions that help support both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism among others functions, such as immunity, digestion, detoxification, amino acid catabolism, bile formation, and vitamin storage5,6. It is connected with nearly every system in the body, hence, it is prone to a variety of pathophysiologies. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is multifactorial in nature and comprises multiple pathways for disease progression. The initial insult is believed to be insulin resistance which could lead to more progressive steatosis with associated hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)7. Two complicated individual stages of the disease are believed to exist, NAFLD which is comprised of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)7. NAFL is characterized by steatosis of the liver, involving more than 5% of parenchyma, with no evidence of hepatocyte injury8. NASH is a necroinflammatory involving hepatic stellate cells and other pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-17, causing the liver cells to become injured in a background of steatosis8. The mechanism of progression for NAFL to NASH is currently unclear, but early evidence eludes to the sequential development of the disease7. Interestingly, one study from Jonscher et al. has reported findings in mice flown for 13 days aboard the Space Transportation System (STS)−135 to have liver damage through accumulation of hepatic lipids droplets, elevated triglyceride levels, and loss of retinoids from the hepatic stellate cells (HSC) lipid droplets9. These results were correlated with the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα is a transcriptional modulator of genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, fatty acid transport and hepatic glucose production, the latter being rodent-specific10. Pro-inflammatory and acute phase response signaling pathways are negatively regulating PPARα, as seen in rodent models of systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)11,12. Dysregulation of the PPARα signaling can lead to the generation of markers which are known to be precursor to early nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-like symptoms13,14. Pecaut et al. demonstrated later from the same tissue that there were also increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased insulin levels15. In addition, Blaber et al. was able to uncover that a decrease with the defense mechanisms associated with hepatic oxidation (i.e. involving genes associated with autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome) can induce mitochondrial dysfunction through senescence from a multi-omics analysis utilizing rodent livers from the STS-135 mission16. Lastly, several proteomic studies on the liver related to NAFLD have revealed key pathways being regulated in the liver which include cell cycle, glucose metabolism, autophagy, ketogenesis, and fatty acid transport that corresponds with what is being observed with the spaceflight samples17,18. Astronauts’ data have shown similar physiological changes involving diabetogenic responses to microgravity such as reduced glucose tolerance, increased plasma glucose, relative decrease in circulating insulin and increased C-peptide excretion and insulin resistance4. Since astronauts and cosmonauts displayed subclinical glucose intolerance and issues with insulin secretion and metabolism4, deeper study of the effects of microgravity on liver function are essential to understand the implications of long-term space travel. One important confounding factor for experiments conducted on the Space Shuttle is that animals were typically brought back live, with animals experiencing the stresses of re-entry and brief re-adaptation to Earth gravity. Sacrifice of animals were done 3.5 to 5.5 hours from de-orbit for mice from the STS-135 missions. Liver is known to be susceptible to stress, and live return may therefore have elicited molecular changes in the organs collected9. In other words, previous observations done on Space Shuttle samples may partially reflect changes in the liver that were only transient and were not induced by life in space. In this study, we performed histology on archived liver tissues obtained from Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) from mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS). In these samples, mice were sacrificed in space and the experimental duration was much longer, removing the stress factor that could be observed when collecting tissue near the travel time. The same tissue had already been processed for both transcriptomics and proteomics by the GeneLab team and raw data was archived on NASA’s GeneLab database platform19–21. We therefore conducted pathway analysis on data from the same animals to see what molecular changes were revealed by omics. Our results demonstrate large changes in lipid localization and lipid and fatty acid metabolism and processing, regardless of strain and flight conditions. We confirmed that PPARα signaling is modified in the space environment. In addition, we also identified novel pathways and factors, which are correlated with early onset of liver diseases involving GCG and the circadian clock pathway. We believe this comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight induced liver damage warrants more investigations at the human level.",

    "results": "Results Histology of mouse liver flight samples indicates liver damage To assess the severity of steatosis and inflammation, liver samples were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and ORO and analyzed by light microscopy and digital image analysis (DIA)22 (Fig. 1A). Jonscher et al. had originally shown in the livers of C57BL/6 mice that were flown on the STS-135 mission that there was an increase of ORO stain indicating increased levels of lipid accumulation in the liver9. One large confounding factor in this work was the fact that animals were returned live to Earth and thus suffered significant stress related to such return. Since their publication, multiple other rodent missions have been flown to the ISS which do not suffer from this confounding factor with animals sacrificed on the station. We have therefore utilized mice liver samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and Rodent Research 3 (RR-3) missions to further confirm whether increases in lipids in the liver is the result of spaceflight alone. As shown in Fig. 1B, flight samples from the RR-1 NASA and RR-1 CASIS missions showed significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher ORO staining, than the ground control samples (Fig. 1B), but there was no significant difference between RR-3 flight and ground samples. To determine if the duration of spaceflight exposure was correlated to increased ORO positivity, we compared the percent change in ORO positivity in RR-1 CASIS livers with RR-1 NASA livers, in which mice were exposed to 21 days and 37 days of spaceflight, respectively. However, the difference between these groups was not significant (p-value = 0.07) (Fig. 1C). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Oil Red O (ORO) staining in flight and ground mouse liver samples from RR-1 CASIS, RR-1 NASA and RR-3 missions. (A) Representative images of Oil Red O staining performed on OCT embedded frozen liver sections from flight and ground for all missions. Scale bar = 20 mm. (B) Flight samples from all missions show higher percent of tissue area stained with ORO indicative of liver damage across both strains of mice (unpaired Mann Whitney (Wilconox) test). (C) Temporal analysis of percent change of ORO lipid positivity in mice liver. Significant increase in lipid deposition is observed in livers of C57/BL6 exposed to microgravity for longer duration of time (unpaired Mann Whitney (Wilcoxon) test).In addition, a two-way ANOVA was done on the normalized data, using the mission (i.e. RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, RR-3) and flight conditions (i.e. Flight vs Ground) as two different factors. A P-value of 0.0008 was found for the flight condition factor, clearly identifying space environment as the most significant factor influencing the level of ORO in the liver. However, ANOVA test also revealed a P-value of 0.0509 for the impact of mission, indicating each mission had significant impact on the difference of ORO level. When testing for interaction between the two factors, P-values dropped to 0.0004 for the flight condition and to 0.0323 for the mission factor with a significant interaction between mission and flight conditions. This suggests that the mission itself affects significantly the relationship between ORO level in the liver and space environment, with RR1-NASA samples showing the largest impact. One could interpret these results as duration having a significant impact on ORO level for the 37-day mission with C57BL/6 showing a significant increase of ORO in the liver compared to the 21-day mission. Similarly, the significant difference between RR-3 and RR-1 (i.e. 42-day and 37-day mission respectively) is probably reflecting a strain difference and ideally one would need an equivalent experiment for the duration of flight for the BALB/C to conclude definitively. We conclude that increasing exposure to microgravity-based chronic perturbation increases the lipid accumulation in a strain independent manner. Global transcriptomics differences occur between mouse liver flight samples and ground controls To further investigate molecular changes that will occur in the liver during spaceflight that can cause the histological changes observed, we utilized existing omics datasets from GeneLab which included: GeneLab Datasets (GLDS)−25, GLDS-47, and GLDS-168. GLDS-25 contained transcriptomics data (i.e. microarrays) from livers flown on the STS-135 shuttle mission (female C57BL/6 mice flown for 13 days on STS-135) while GLDS-168 and GLDS-47 contain RNA-sequencing data for liver samples from mice flown to the ISS for both the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) (female C57BL/6 mice flown for 37 days on the ISS) and RR3 missions (female BALB/c mice flown for ~40 days on the ISS), respectively. GLDS-47 data were gathered by CASIS while GLDS-168 data was gathered by NASA. As mentioned in the previous section, Jonscher et al. had previously performed analysis on the liver for the STS-135 mission9. They performed transcriptomic and metabolomics to uncover genes and metabolites that changed during spaceflight associated with lipid accumulation in the liver that seemed to be driving PPAR response. For our analysis not only did we utilize the STS-135 dataset, but also used complementary transcriptomic and proteomic technology on datasets that did not suffer from live return. This allowed us to confirm that spaceflight alone is eliciting such significant changes in the liver. Overall, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots show strong statistical separation between the liver flight samples and the ground controls (Fig. 2), independent of duration, flight condition, and strain. This indicates that large transcriptomics changes are occurring in the liver during spaceflight and warrants more detailed pathway analysis to determine the key functions driving the changes in the liver during spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The global transcriptomics differences on livers from mice flown in space compared to ground controls. Clustering of individual biological liver samples from mice for each transcriptomics dataset (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) from GeneLab utilizing t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (upper plots) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (lower plots) comparing Spaceflight samples to ground controls. Lines are drawn in the t-SNA plots to visually separate the flight samples from the ground controls. The axis for t-SNE plots are arbitrary. The variance for the PCA plots is indicated in the axis. The coordinates of each point in each plot represents the two most important gene pattern contributions (e.g. principal component for PCA) of individual biological replicates. Each replicate is obtained from individual mice exposed to the same experimental conditions. Two points in close proximity suggests a very similar gene expression pattern between the two corresponding samples. Pathway analysis reveals upregulation of lipid functions and regulation in the liver of flight samples We utilized pathway analysis tools to fully understand the global impact of spaceflight on the liver tissue. Through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)23 we determined the significant pathways (or gene sets) with a FDR ≤ 0.05 that are either activated or inhibited between livers from spaceflight versus the ground controls. We performed GSEA analyses on both Reactome pathways24 and the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process ontology25,26, clearly identifying the key pathways that were regulated in mice flown on the shuttle missions (STS-135). Since the Reactome pathways led to a less complex network, we will only report and discuss these pathways for the STS-135 data (Supplemental Fig. 2). We also provided the list of GO pathways as Supplemental Table 1. We observe that the majority of pathways being regulated in the liver are upregulated (i.e. red nodes in Supplemental Fig. 2), with a strong association to changes in lipids and lipoproteins metabolism27. This activation correlates with the lipid accumulation observed with the histology (Fig. 1). In addition, the activation of protein metabolism that is observed can be potentially linked to liver disease, since it has been previously reported that the dysregulation of this pathway is often associated with deamination and transamination of amino acids, disruption in amino acid kinetics, and possible cirrhosis28. GSEA analysis was performed using GO pathways on the RNA-seq data for both female C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice that were flown on the ISS for ~40 days (RR1 and RR3 mission). We observed similarities and differences between all data sets (Supplemental Fig. 3). More specifically, nodes/pathways associated with lipid and fatty acid processing and metabolism were upregulated in both shorter missions on the shuttle (STS-135) and longer mission in the ISS (RR1, RR3), as denoted with yellow background in both Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3. In contrast, there are many more pathways that were oppositely regulated in livers between the two different strains (RR1 and RR3 missions). This observation is consistent with recent reports29, suggesting inherent differences in liver response between C57BL/6 and BALB/C, with differences in immune cell types, liver cytokine profiles, liver steatosis, degree of adiposity, and glucose levels. It has been reported under a normal diet that BALB/C mice compared to C57BL/6 mice have more pronounced liver steatosis and body weight gain. On the other hand, C57BL/6 mice exhibit higher weight gain, increased collagen deposition, and an increase in visceral adipose tissue on a high-fat diet29. Potentially, these differences related to body weight gain and collagen changes between the strains can account for the differences observed in the strains with the catabolic process associated pathways. Further studies should be done to investigate these differences, but for the focus of this manuscript we will be comparing the common pathways that are being regulated in the liver due to spaceflight. When comparing only the common GO biological processes in the liver for spaceflight samples versus ground controls across all three datasets (i.e. RR1, RR3, and STS135 missions), we once again see lipid and fatty acid related processes being predominantly upregulated with a fairly uniform response across the three experimental groups (Fig. 3A). Other pathways found to be upregulated here are ion transport, alditol metabolic process, and vitamin/drug metabolic processing, all potentially associated with lipid functions. Interestingly, circadian clock related pathways were also commonly upregulated in the liver, which has been shown in the literature to greatly impact the lipid function and be involved with NAFLD30. When testing the same data with proprietary tools such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), several upstream regulators were predicted to be present in all conditions (Fig. 3B). Two upstream regulators were commonly regulated across all conditions, with Glucagon (GCG) being commonly downregulated and Insulin (INS) being commonly upregulated across all datasets and conditions. Although, GCG and INS are more commonly found to be involved with pancreatic functions to regulate blood sugar levels, it has also been shown that such signals in the liver can play a role with disease state. For example, an upregulation of INS can provide the liver with high blood glucose signals. In contrast GCG allows the liver to convert glycogen to glucose when the blood sugar levels are low31, and thus downregulation of GCG would interrupt such conversion eventually lowering blood glucose levels. Therefore, we propose that the upstream effectors that are predicted to regulate these changes are GCG and INS, which may be responding to physiological conditions that are observed during periods of high blood glucose levels. Similarly, these two upstream regulators are also known to be involved with lipid and fatty acid functions32. Overall, we believe that we have shown spaceflight induces in the liver of mice driving factors that might be responsible in driving NAFLD pathogenesis. Figure 3.

Clusters were named according to common function in each grouping. (B) Upstream regulator analysis utilizing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on the significantly regulated genes (FDR < 0.05). The results are shown only for the common upstream regulators across all conditions (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) as a heatmap of the activated z-scores. Duration changes in livers from mice flown in space Although the theme of this manuscript is determining functions in the liver that will be impacted by spaceflight independent of duration and strain, we thought it will be important to also briefly discuss the differences in biological functions that will occur as a function of duration. For this analysis we have utilized data from the same strain mice (i.e. C57BL/6) with two different durations in space on the ISS (21 and 37 days) to remove any additional confounding factors. This comparison will give us some insight on potential biological changes that will occur with longer exposure to the space environment on the liver. As in the previous section, for comparisons between different GeneLab datasets and omics platforms, we performed the analysis with the normalized enrichment scores (NES) determined through GSEA GO terms. To study the impact of duration in space on the liver, we directly compared the GO terms from the GSEA analysis containing FDR ≤ 0.05 between the two RR1 datasets (Fig. 4). We observed, in agreement with the previous results, that pathways related to lipid and mitochondrial functions were activated independent of duration in space. In addition, pathways related to innate immune functions were inhibited independent of duration in space which was also shown in the previous section for all datasets (Fig. 3A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Pathway differences occurring in the liver as a function of duration in space. Comparison of the GO terms through the NES between the RR1 datasets with FDR ≤ 0.05. The right colored side bar on the heatmap indicates pathways grouped together with common functionality. In the heatmap the blue color represents inhibition determined by negative NES and the red color represents activation determined by positive NES.There were a set of pathways which were shown to be increased with longer duration in space in the liver (Fig. 4). The majority of these pathways are related to increases in the adaptive immune system. It has been previously shown that long exposure to the space environment does indeed activate persistent adaptive immune system pathways which will have potential to impact spaceflight associated health risks linked to reactivation of latent herpesviruses and increased incidence of infectious diseases3,15,33. Other pathways that were increased with longer space duration were oxidation of glucose, adipose tissue development, protein folding, fatty acid metabolic process, translation and ribosome functions, protein folding, and cell activation (Fig. 4). Oxidation of glucose and adipose tissue development are directly impacted by the adaptive immune system34,35 and both have been previously linked with adaptive immune system changes during spaceflight3,15. In addition, protein folding, translation, and ribosome pathways have been directly linked to activation of the adaptive immune system36,37. The increase in the fatty acid metabolic process pathways are in agreement with our results in the previous sections indicating an increase in the lipid accumulation as a function of duration in space (Fig. 1). These increases that occur during longer spaceflight are still in agreement with our observed results in the previous sections regarding accumulation of lipids in the liver, since increases in the adaptive immune system have also been associated with dysregulation with lipid and fatty acid functions38. Proteomics analysis on livers from mice flown in space exhibit lipid related proteins driving lipid metabolic processes Since transcriptomics data does not always translate directly to protein functions, we analyzed the proteomics data available on GeneLab for livers from the same mice as for the transcriptomics data. The only proteomics data available on GeneLab were for mice flown on the RR1 and RR3 missions. From the proteomics data, we determined the significantly regulated proteins (p-value ≤ 0.05) in the liver for spaceflight versus ground controls. From these proteins, we focused only on the proteins related to lipid functions and pathways chosen from the GO related annotations (Fig. 5A–C). From this analysis there are less significantly regulated lipid related proteins in RR1 mice than RR3 mice (Fig. 5A). This difference in the number of lipid related proteins can possibly be due to the strain differences between the two rodent missions (as discussed earlier). Although, these differences occur, we chose to focus on the common pathways that the proteins are regulating since it is known that different proteins can impact common pathways. The lipid related proteins for the livers from the RR3 mission were being expressed according to how the NAFLD pathogenesis will form. For example, the Apolipoproteins (ApoC1, ApoA2, and ApoA5) were being downregulated in the flight samples (Fig. 5A). For RR1 related lipid proteins we also observed that Fgl1 is upregulated. In addition, Cyp7a1 is known to be heavily involved with bile acid production and are known to impact both insulin production and NAFLD progression13,39. Cyp1A2 is increased with our proteomic data, and is an enzyme involved with detoxification. Cyp1A2 has been previously detected in livers of mice flown in space and with its levels returning to normal after the mice have reacclimated on Earth40. Interestingly, these proteins that are known to be associated with lipid functions are highly connected together in action and function (Fig. 5B,C) determined by inputting these proteins in STRING41 to construct a protein interaction network. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Lipid related proteins from proteomics analysis on livers from mice for RR1 and RR3 datasets. (A) The fold-change (log2) values for the lipid related proteins comparing livers from mice from both RR1 and RR3 GeneLab proteomics datasets. (B,C) RR1 and RR3 lipid related protein interaction networks predicted using STRING41, which considers both direct (e.g. co-IP) and indirect (e.g. co-expression, text mining) interactions. (D) The overall predicted common Gene Ontology (GO) molecular functions, GO biological processes, and pathways being regulated by all the lipid proteins for both RR1 and RR3 proteomics datasets determined by ToppCluster in the ToppGene Suite42. Cytoscape43 was utilized to displaying the connected network of functions. The colors for the node indicate the group the functions are associated with. The edges (connecting lines between the nodes) represent the connection between either the RR1 or RR3 proteins to the predicted pathways (green line), molecular functions (blue line), or biological process (aqua line).Lastly, we predicted the overall functional impact of the specific lipid proteins for livers from both RR1 and RR3 mice (Fig. 5D). The common predicted functions were determined by entering the lipid related proteins for RR1 and RR3 (Fig. 5A) in ToppCluster in the ToppGene Suite42 and displaying the connected network of functions for both RR1 and RR3 related lipid proteins with Cytoscape43. From this analysis it was revealed that the lipid proteins from the liver of the mice for both RR1 and RR3 missions shared common pathways potentially impacting lipid related metabolic processes and cholesterol binding pathways (Fig. 5D). Further research should be conducted to determine actual functional impact. In addition, it was revealed that these lipid proteins are directly linked to the PPAR signaling pathway. Jonscher et al. had previously demonstrated from work done on mice from the STS-135 mission, that PPARα was a highly upregulated pathway in the liver of these mice due to spaceflight and played an important role in lipid metabolism9. They believed that this regulation in the liver of PPARα due to spaceflight can be an indication of early NAFLD disease progression13,14.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The current investigation demonstrates fluctuations in the temporal patterns of biochemical signal transduction pathways caused by microgravity in three distinct spaceflight datasets (RR1-NASA, RR1-CASIS and RR3) involving RNA-seq and proteomics data analysis compared to microarray data from STS-135. Intriguingly, a subset of the metabolic pathways and molecular factors seem consistent with NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), a multi-factorial metabolic disease that upon progression could lead to NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and finally irreversible liver fibrosis13,14,27. This subset of metabolic pathways include activation of lipid related pathways (in Fig. 3: lipid catabolic process, lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolic process, lipid localization, lipoprotein metabolic process, and regulation of lipid storage), dysregulation of PARR pathways, Apolipoproteins, INS, and GCG (Figs. 3B and 5). Lipid metabolism in spaceflight environments, specifically in the realm of lipid homeostasis, remains largely unclear to date. Mice flown in short mission STS1359, demonstrated major perturbations in key regulatory genes in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Such perturbation is often thought to be the “first-hit” of NAFLD44 characterized by insulin resistance and perturbed fatty acid metabolism leading to liver lipid accumulation and steatosis45. Similarly in this work, histopathological analysis of hepatic lipid content as a biomarker demonstrated marked increase in ORO positivity in all space missions (Fig. 1). Upregulated pathways in these results have a direct impact in dysregulation of the lipids and contribution to increased risk of NAFLD. Our proteomic analysis showed that apolipoproteins were inhibited (Fig. 5). From the literature apolipoproteins have been shown to be involved in the formation of lipoproteins by binding to liver derived lipids and inhibition of the apolipoproteins can result in increased chances of NAFLD46. The upregulation of GCG is known to decrease fatty acid synthesis, synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis, and increase lipolysis in the liver32. GCG and INS are also known to be involved in a feedback loop designed to maintain homeostasis for the blood glucose levels32. Our analysis indicates that INS is indeed upregulated while GCG is downregulated in the liver indicating that there can be an increase in lipid accumulation as we observed with the histology (Figs. 1 and 3). The upregulation of glucose metabolism that we observe has also been reported to contribute to liver disease through disruption of the normal glucose homeostasis that the liver maintains and also involved in insulin resistance47. The cell cycle pathways are observed to be upregulated and it has been reported that during excessive cell division that lipid accumulation can occur in the dividing cells contributing to dysregulation for lipid metabolism48. Lastly, we observe an increase in carbohydrate metabolism which has been reported to be associated with increased rate for the development of NAFLD27. PPARα-mediated pathways were found to be activated in the proteomic data (Fig. 5), and mostly predicted to be downregulated in the transcriptomic data (Fig. 3B). Such downregulation has been associated to the “second-hit” phase of NAFLD known to lead to inflammation and fibrosis, an important pathophysiologic criteria for NASH and irreversible liver fibrosis, which also involve mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress44. In addition, Fgl1 protein was elevated in the spaceflight livers (Fig. 4). This protein has been associated with late-stage NAFLD development and has been observed to have elevated expression in livers from obese patients with NASH49. Other suggestions of the “second hit” mechanism for NAFLD in our data are related to B-cell inhibition, with all datasets (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) (Fig. 3). B-cell regulation has been shown to play a small role with NAFLD progression50. Interestingly, the B-cell inhibition can also be involved with immunosuppression that is observed during spaceflight as discussed by Pecaut et al. for data that was obtained on mice from the STS-135 mission15. In this work, the observed lipid uptake in liver occurred in both strains, with C57Bl/6J showing a stronger response both by histopathology (Fig. 1) and by a stronger separation of ground and flight gene expression by t-SNE plots (Fig. 2). Such observation is consistent with strain susceptibility of early onset of liver disease. For instance, looking at hyperplasia as an early onset of liver disease, it has been shown that C57Bl/6J have a higher spontaneous level of liver hyperplasia than BALB/cByJ, with 15.45% of young mice (16 weeks)30 and 3% of older mice (16–36 months old)51 positive for liver hyperplasia. In contrast, only one study52 reporting on liver hyperplasia in BALB/CByJ showed 0% of hyperplasia in either female or male, looking at bile ducts. In terms of response to treatment, the study30 on younger C57Bl/6J also showed that simply dysregulating the circadian rhythm with modified light cycles was sufficient to increase the level of hyperplasia from 15.45% to 75%. When remembering the difficulty for the animal to stay idle in microgravity53, it is not surprising to see the circadian rhythm being upregulated for all datasets and mouse strains (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) (Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3) and provides a source of stress that have been clearly correlated with liver hyperplasia in mice. Finally, C57BL/6 strain also displays severe phenotype of diet-induced NAFLD/NASH associated liver injury, obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin response through genetic or epigenetic mechanisms compared to BALB/C54,55. Even though everything is done to keep the light cycle as close to Earth as possible in these missions, microgravity most likely modifies sleeping pattern of these mice in space, primarily because of the difficulty for the animal to stay idle in microgravity53. Therefore, circadian rhythm seems to be an additional candidate that can contribute to NAFLD disease progression. We observe through our results that indeed circadian clock pathways are being upregulated for all datasets and mouse strains. (STS-135, RR-1, and RR-3) (Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). In addition to microgravity, there are other factors in space that may also lead to liver disruption. One clear stressor that has been studied extensively in mice are ionizing radiation. However, most radiation studies have been focused on cancer as an endpoint. When searching the literature for the two strains used in our analysis, as observed for hyperplasia, reports were heavily biased towards C57BL/6J. One study56 showed how ionizing radiation elicited liver tumors, with 7.69% hepatocellular adenoma detected 92–94 weeks following 4Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) (Cs-137 source; 2.5Gy/min) at 12–14 weeks of age. Interestingly, in this work, mutating the gene Clock was sufficient to block tumor onset, implicating again circadian rhythm in radiation-induced liver carcinogenesis, and thus suggesting that the combination of space environment and disrupted sleep may work synergistically in enhancing liver disease, potentially including cancer. Another study57 reported 11.11% increase in hepatocellular carcinoma detected 14 months after radiation exposure to unspecified high doses of ionizing radiation. Nothing could be found in the literature regarding Balb/cByJ and radiation-induced liver tumors. One note of caution here in terms of interpretation is that the radiation doses used in the studies listed above are a thousand-fold higher than the two missions considered here. As one can find in GeneLab metadata for RR-1 and RR-3 missions, the total dose received to the animals was about the same in both cases: i.e. ~6.9 mGy delivered chronically over 4 weeks, with 60% of the dose from cosmic radiation instead of low-LET radiation used in the acute dose studies. To conclude, we have identified in this work that NAFLD related pathways are activated in mice flown in space, independently of the strain or the duration of the mission. We suspect that activation of these pathways will persist during longer duration spaceflight missions, will be exacerbated by disrupted sleep resulting in gradual deposition of lipids in the liver and increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and irreversible liver fibrosis. More studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of activation and persistence of this process to infer risks to astronauts.",

Abstract Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Proteomics, Risk factors, Transcriptomics, Systems biologyIntroduction Spaceflight affects several physiological and biochemical processes in astronauts and rodent models. The most reported changes from the space environment are in muscle and bone loss1,2. Several studies also indicate that spaceflight affects components of the immune system, including the distribution and functionality of peripheral leukocytes, and activity of cytokines3. In addition, several decades of spaceflight investigations have eluded that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that happen in microgravity4. Research involving spaceflight and simulated ground-based microgravity studies (i.e. bedrest studies) result in manifestation of similar diseases such as diabetes, sedentary states, and aging4. Insulin resistance is believed to be a key risk factor for fatty liver disease, which is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. To date, little work has been done on other tissues such as liver or pancreas because these tissues are not considered to be at risk for long-term spaceflight missions. However, with the increasing precision of omics technology, the approach to evaluate risk from long space missions may find a new paradigm. For example, liver, a critical organ for mammals, has been largely under-studied in the context of spaceflight environment. It performs array of functions that help support both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism among others functions, such as immunity, digestion, detoxification, amino acid catabolism, bile formation, and vitamin storage5,6. It is connected with nearly every system in the body, hence, it is prone to a variety of pathophysiologies. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is multifactorial in nature and comprises multiple pathways for disease progression. The initial insult is believed to be insulin resistance which could lead to more progressive steatosis with associated hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)7. Two complicated individual stages of the disease are believed to exist, NAFLD which is comprised of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)7. NAFL is characterized by steatosis of the liver, involving more than 5% of parenchyma, with no evidence of hepatocyte injury8. NASH is a necroinflammatory involving hepatic stellate cells and other pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-17, causing the liver cells to become injured in a background of steatosis8. The mechanism of progression for NAFL to NASH is currently unclear, but early evidence eludes to the sequential development of the disease7. Interestingly, one study from Jonscher et al. has reported findings in mice flown for 13 days aboard the Space Transportation System (STS)−135 to have liver damage through accumulation of hepatic lipids droplets, elevated triglyceride levels, and loss of retinoids from the hepatic stellate cells (HSC) lipid droplets9. These results were correlated with the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα is a transcriptional modulator of genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, fatty acid transport and hepatic glucose production, the latter being rodent-specific10. Pro-inflammatory and acute phase response signaling pathways are negatively regulating PPARα, as seen in rodent models of systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)11,12. Dysregulation of the PPARα signaling can lead to the generation of markers which are known to be precursor to early nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-like symptoms13,14. Pecaut et al. demonstrated later from the same tissue that there were also increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased insulin levels15. In addition, Blaber et al. was able to uncover that a decrease with the defense mechanisms associated with hepatic oxidation (i.e. involving genes associated with autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome) can induce mitochondrial dysfunction through senescence from a multi-omics analysis utilizing rodent livers from the STS-135 mission16. Lastly, several proteomic studies on the liver related to NAFLD have revealed key pathways being regulated in the liver which include cell cycle, glucose metabolism, autophagy, ketogenesis, and fatty acid transport that corresponds with what is being observed with the spaceflight samples17,18. Astronauts’ data have shown similar physiological changes involving diabetogenic responses to microgravity such as reduced glucose tolerance, increased plasma glucose, relative decrease in circulating insulin and increased C-peptide excretion and insulin resistance4. Since astronauts and cosmonauts displayed subclinical glucose intolerance and issues with insulin secretion and metabolism4, deeper study of the effects of microgravity on liver function are essential to understand the implications of long-term space travel. One important confounding factor for experiments conducted on the Space Shuttle is that animals were typically brought back live, with animals experiencing the stresses of re-entry and brief re-adaptation to Earth gravity. Sacrifice of animals were done 3.5 to 5.5 hours from de-orbit for mice from the STS-135 missions. Liver is known to be susceptible to stress, and live return may therefore have elicited molecular changes in the organs collected9. In other words, previous observations done on Space Shuttle samples may partially reflect changes in the liver that were only transient and were not induced by life in space. In this study, we performed histology on archived liver tissues obtained from Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) from mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS). In these samples, mice were sacrificed in space and the experimental duration was much longer, removing the stress factor that could be observed when collecting tissue near the travel time. The same tissue had already been processed for both transcriptomics and proteomics by the GeneLab team and raw data was archived on NASA’s GeneLab database platform19–21. We therefore conducted pathway analysis on data from the same animals to see what molecular changes were revealed by omics. Our results demonstrate large changes in lipid localization and lipid and fatty acid metabolism and processing, regardless of strain and flight conditions. We confirmed that PPARα signaling is modified in the space environment. In addition, we also identified novel pathways and factors, which are correlated with early onset of liver diseases involving GCG and the circadian clock pathway. We believe this comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight induced liver damage warrants more investigations at the human level.Results Histology of mouse liver flight samples indicates liver damage To assess the severity of steatosis and inflammation, liver samples were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and ORO and analyzed by light microscopy and digital image analysis (DIA)22 (Fig. 1A). Jonscher et al. had originally shown in the livers of C57BL/6 mice that were flown on the STS-135 mission that there was an increase of ORO stain indicating increased levels of lipid accumulation in the liver9. One large confounding factor in this work was the fact that animals were returned live to Earth and thus suffered significant stress related to such return. Since their publication, multiple other rodent missions have been flown to the ISS which do not suffer from this confounding factor with animals sacrificed on the station. We have therefore utilized mice liver samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and Rodent Research 3 (RR-3) missions to further confirm whether increases in lipids in the liver is the result of spaceflight alone. As shown in Fig. 1B, flight samples from the RR-1 NASA and RR-1 CASIS missions showed significantly (p-value < 0.05) higher ORO staining, than the ground control samples (Fig. 1B), but there was no significant difference between RR-3 flight and ground samples. To determine if the duration of spaceflight exposure was correlated to increased ORO positivity, we compared the percent change in ORO positivity in RR-1 CASIS livers with RR-1 NASA livers, in which mice were exposed to 21 days and 37 days of spaceflight, respectively. However, the difference between these groups was not significant (p-value = 0.07) (Fig. 1C). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Oil Red O (ORO) staining in flight and ground mouse liver samples from RR-1 CASIS, RR-1 NASA and RR-3 missions. (A) Representative images of Oil Red O staining performed on OCT embedded frozen liver sections from flight and ground for all missions. Scale bar = 20 mm. (B) Flight samples from all missions show higher percent of tissue area stained with ORO indicative of liver damage across both strains of mice (unpaired Mann Whitney (Wilconox) test). (C) Temporal analysis of percent change of ORO lipid positivity in mice liver. Significant increase in lipid deposition is observed in livers of C57/BL6 exposed to microgravity for longer duration of time (unpaired Mann Whitney (Wilcoxon) test).In addition, a two-way ANOVA was done on the normalized data, using the mission (i.e. RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, RR-3) and flight conditions (i.e. Flight vs Ground) as two different factors. A P-value of 0.0008 was found for the flight condition factor, clearly identifying space environment as the most significant factor influencing the level of ORO in the liver. However, ANOVA test also revealed a P-value of 0.0509 for the impact of mission, indicating each mission had significant impact on the difference of ORO level. When testing for interaction between the two factors, P-values dropped to 0.0004 for the flight condition and to 0.0323 for the mission factor with a significant interaction between mission and flight conditions. This suggests that the mission itself affects significantly the relationship between ORO level in the liver and space environment, with RR1-NASA samples showing the largest impact. One could interpret these results as duration having a significant impact on ORO level for the 37-day mission with C57BL/6 showing a significant increase of ORO in the liver compared to the 21-day mission. Similarly, the significant difference between RR-3 and RR-1 (i.e. 42-day and 37-day mission respectively) is probably reflecting a strain difference and ideally one would need an equivalent experiment for the duration of flight for the BALB/C to conclude definitively. We conclude that increasing exposure to microgravity-based chronic perturbation increases the lipid accumulation in a strain independent manner.Global transcriptomics differences occur between mouse liver flight samples and ground controls To further investigate molecular changes that will occur in the liver during spaceflight that can cause the histological changes observed, we utilized existing omics datasets from GeneLab which included: GeneLab Datasets (GLDS)−25, GLDS-47, and GLDS-168. GLDS-25 contained transcriptomics data (i.e. microarrays) from livers flown on the STS-135 shuttle mission (female C57BL/6 mice flown for 13 days on STS-135) while GLDS-168 and GLDS-47 contain RNA-sequencing data for liver samples from mice flown to the ISS for both the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) (female C57BL/6 mice flown for 37 days on the ISS) and RR3 missions (female BALB/c mice flown for ~40 days on the ISS), respectively. GLDS-47 data were gathered by CASIS while GLDS-168 data was gathered by NASA. As mentioned in the previous section, Jonscher et al. had previously performed analysis on the liver for the STS-135 mission9. They performed transcriptomic and metabolomics to uncover genes and metabolites that changed during spaceflight associated with lipid accumulation in the liver that seemed to be driving PPAR response. For our analysis not only did we utilize the STS-135 dataset, but also used complementary transcriptomic and proteomic technology on datasets that did not suffer from live return. This allowed us to confirm that spaceflight alone is eliciting such significant changes in the liver. Overall, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots show strong statistical separation between the liver flight samples and the ground controls (Fig. 2), independent of duration, flight condition, and strain. This indicates that large transcriptomics changes are occurring in the liver during spaceflight and warrants more detailed pathway analysis to determine the key functions driving the changes in the liver during spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The global transcriptomics differences on livers from mice flown in space compared to ground controls. Clustering of individual biological liver samples from mice for each transcriptomics dataset (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) from GeneLab utilizing t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (upper plots) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (lower plots) comparing Spaceflight samples to ground controls. Lines are drawn in the t-SNA plots to visually separate the flight samples from the ground controls. The axis for t-SNE plots are arbitrary. The variance for the PCA plots is indicated in the axis. The coordinates of each point in each plot represents the two most important gene pattern contributions (e.g. principal component for PCA) of individual biological replicates. Each replicate is obtained from individual mice exposed to the same experimental conditions. Two points in close proximity suggests a very similar gene expression pattern between the two corresponding samples.Pathway analysis reveals upregulation of lipid functions and regulation in the liver of flight samples We utilized pathway analysis tools to fully understand the global impact of spaceflight on the liver tissue. Through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)23 we determined the significant pathways (or gene sets) with a FDR ≤ 0.05 that are either activated or inhibited between livers from spaceflight versus the ground controls. We performed GSEA analyses on both Reactome pathways24 and the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process ontology25,26, clearly identifying the key pathways that were regulated in mice flown on the shuttle missions (STS-135). Since the Reactome pathways led to a less complex network, we will only report and discuss these pathways for the STS-135 data (Supplemental Fig. 2). We also provided the list of GO pathways as Supplemental Table 1. We observe that the majority of pathways being regulated in the liver are upregulated (i.e. red nodes in Supplemental Fig. 2), with a strong association to changes in lipids and lipoproteins metabolism27. This activation correlates with the lipid accumulation observed with the histology (Fig. 1). In addition, the activation of protein metabolism that is observed can be potentially linked to liver disease, since it has been previously reported that the dysregulation of this pathway is often associated with deamination and transamination of amino acids, disruption in amino acid kinetics, and possible cirrhosis28. GSEA analysis was performed using GO pathways on the RNA-seq data for both female C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice that were flown on the ISS for ~40 days (RR1 and RR3 mission). We observed similarities and differences between all data sets (Supplemental Fig. 3). More specifically, nodes/pathways associated with lipid and fatty acid processing and metabolism were upregulated in both shorter missions on the shuttle (STS-135) and longer mission in the ISS (RR1, RR3), as denoted with yellow background in both Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3. In contrast, there are many more pathways that were oppositely regulated in livers between the two different strains (RR1 and RR3 missions). This observation is consistent with recent reports29, suggesting inherent differences in liver response between C57BL/6 and BALB/C, with differences in immune cell types, liver cytokine profiles, liver steatosis, degree of adiposity, and glucose levels. It has been reported under a normal diet that BALB/C mice compared to C57BL/6 mice have more pronounced liver steatosis and body weight gain. On the other hand, C57BL/6 mice exhibit higher weight gain, increased collagen deposition, and an increase in visceral adipose tissue on a high-fat diet29. Potentially, these differences related to body weight gain and collagen changes between the strains can account for the differences observed in the strains with the catabolic process associated pathways. Further studies should be done to investigate these differences, but for the focus of this manuscript we will be comparing the common pathways that are being regulated in the liver due to spaceflight. When comparing only the common GO biological processes in the liver for spaceflight samples versus ground controls across all three datasets (i.e. RR1, RR3, and STS135 missions), we once again see lipid and fatty acid related processes being predominantly upregulated with a fairly uniform response across the three experimental groups (Fig. 3A). Other pathways found to be upregulated here are ion transport, alditol metabolic process, and vitamin/drug metabolic processing, all potentially associated with lipid functions. Interestingly, circadian clock related pathways were also commonly upregulated in the liver, which has been shown in the literature to greatly impact the lipid function and be involved with NAFLD30. When testing the same data with proprietary tools such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), several upstream regulators were predicted to be present in all conditions (Fig. 3B). Two upstream regulators were commonly regulated across all conditions, with Glucagon (GCG) being commonly downregulated and Insulin (INS) being commonly upregulated across all datasets and conditions. Although, GCG and INS are more commonly found to be involved with pancreatic functions to regulate blood sugar levels, it has also been shown that such signals in the liver can play a role with disease state. For example, an upregulation of INS can provide the liver with high blood glucose signals. In contrast GCG allows the liver to convert glycogen to glucose when the blood sugar levels are low31, and thus downregulation of GCG would interrupt such conversion eventually lowering blood glucose levels. Therefore, we propose that the upstream effectors that are predicted to regulate these changes are GCG and INS, which may be responding to physiological conditions that are observed during periods of high blood glucose levels. Similarly, these two upstream regulators are also known to be involved with lipid and fatty acid functions32. Overall, we believe that we have shown spaceflight induces in the liver of mice driving factors that might be responsible in driving NAFLD pathogenesis. Figure 3.

The results are shown only for the common upstream regulators across all conditions (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) as a heatmap of the activated z-scores.Duration changes in livers from mice flown in space Although the theme of this manuscript is determining functions in the liver that will be impacted by spaceflight independent of duration and strain, we thought it will be important to also briefly discuss the differences in biological functions that will occur as a function of duration. For this analysis we have utilized data from the same strain mice (i.e. C57BL/6) with two different durations in space on the ISS (21 and 37 days) to remove any additional confounding factors. This comparison will give us some insight on potential biological changes that will occur with longer exposure to the space environment on the liver. As in the previous section, for comparisons between different GeneLab datasets and omics platforms, we performed the analysis with the normalized enrichment scores (NES) determined through GSEA GO terms. To study the impact of duration in space on the liver, we directly compared the GO terms from the GSEA analysis containing FDR ≤ 0.05 between the two RR1 datasets (Fig. 4). We observed, in agreement with the previous results, that pathways related to lipid and mitochondrial functions were activated independent of duration in space. In addition, pathways related to innate immune functions were inhibited independent of duration in space which was also shown in the previous section for all datasets (Fig. 3A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Pathway differences occurring in the liver as a function of duration in space. Comparison of the GO terms through the NES between the RR1 datasets with FDR ≤ 0.05. The right colored side bar on the heatmap indicates pathways grouped together with common functionality. In the heatmap the blue color represents inhibition determined by negative NES and the red color represents activation determined by positive NES.There were a set of pathways which were shown to be increased with longer duration in space in the liver (Fig. 4). The majority of these pathways are related to increases in the adaptive immune system. It has been previously shown that long exposure to the space environment does indeed activate persistent adaptive immune system pathways which will have potential to impact spaceflight associated health risks linked to reactivation of latent herpesviruses and increased incidence of infectious diseases3,15,33. Other pathways that were increased with longer space duration were oxidation of glucose, adipose tissue development, protein folding, fatty acid metabolic process, translation and ribosome functions, protein folding, and cell activation (Fig. 4). Oxidation of glucose and adipose tissue development are directly impacted by the adaptive immune system34,35 and both have been previously linked with adaptive immune system changes during spaceflight3,15. In addition, protein folding, translation, and ribosome pathways have been directly linked to activation of the adaptive immune system36,37. The increase in the fatty acid metabolic process pathways are in agreement with our results in the previous sections indicating an increase in the lipid accumulation as a function of duration in space (Fig. 1). These increases that occur during longer spaceflight are still in agreement with our observed results in the previous sections regarding accumulation of lipids in the liver, since increases in the adaptive immune system have also been associated with dysregulation with lipid and fatty acid functions38.Proteomics analysis on livers from mice flown in space exhibit lipid related proteins driving lipid metabolic processes Since transcriptomics data does not always translate directly to protein functions, we analyzed the proteomics data available on GeneLab for livers from the same mice as for the transcriptomics data. The only proteomics data available on GeneLab were for mice flown on the RR1 and RR3 missions. From the proteomics data, we determined the significantly regulated proteins (p-value ≤ 0.05) in the liver for spaceflight versus ground controls. From these proteins, we focused only on the proteins related to lipid functions and pathways chosen from the GO related annotations (Fig. 5A–C). From this analysis there are less significantly regulated lipid related proteins in RR1 mice than RR3 mice (Fig. 5A). This difference in the number of lipid related proteins can possibly be due to the strain differences between the two rodent missions (as discussed earlier). Although, these differences occur, we chose to focus on the common pathways that the proteins are regulating since it is known that different proteins can impact common pathways. The lipid related proteins for the livers from the RR3 mission were being expressed according to how the NAFLD pathogenesis will form. For example, the Apolipoproteins (ApoC1, ApoA2, and ApoA5) were being downregulated in the flight samples (Fig. 5A). For RR1 related lipid proteins we also observed that Fgl1 is upregulated. In addition, Cyp7a1 is known to be heavily involved with bile acid production and are known to impact both insulin production and NAFLD progression13,39. Cyp1A2 is increased with our proteomic data, and is an enzyme involved with detoxification. Cyp1A2 has been previously detected in livers of mice flown in space and with its levels returning to normal after the mice have reacclimated on Earth40. Interestingly, these proteins that are known to be associated with lipid functions are highly connected together in action and function (Fig. 5B,C) determined by inputting these proteins in STRING41 to construct a protein interaction network. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Lipid related proteins from proteomics analysis on livers from mice for RR1 and RR3 datasets. (A) The fold-change (log2) values for the lipid related proteins comparing livers from mice from both RR1 and RR3 GeneLab proteomics datasets. (B,C) RR1 and RR3 lipid related protein interaction networks predicted using STRING41, which considers both direct (e.g. co-IP) and indirect (e.g. co-expression, text mining) interactions. (D) The overall predicted common Gene Ontology (GO) molecular functions, GO biological processes, and pathways being regulated by all the lipid proteins for both RR1 and RR3 proteomics datasets determined by ToppCluster in the ToppGene Suite42. Cytoscape43 was utilized to displaying the connected network of functions. The colors for the node indicate the group the functions are associated with. The edges (connecting lines between the nodes) represent the connection between either the RR1 or RR3 proteins to the predicted pathways (green line), molecular functions (blue line), or biological process (aqua line).Lastly, we predicted the overall functional impact of the specific lipid proteins for livers from both RR1 and RR3 mice (Fig. 5D). The common predicted functions were determined by entering the lipid related proteins for RR1 and RR3 (Fig. 5A) in ToppCluster in the ToppGene Suite42 and displaying the connected network of functions for both RR1 and RR3 related lipid proteins with Cytoscape43. From this analysis it was revealed that the lipid proteins from the liver of the mice for both RR1 and RR3 missions shared common pathways potentially impacting lipid related metabolic processes and cholesterol binding pathways (Fig. 5D). Further research should be conducted to determine actual functional impact. In addition, it was revealed that these lipid proteins are directly linked to the PPAR signaling pathway. Jonscher et al. had previously demonstrated from work done on mice from the STS-135 mission, that PPARα was a highly upregulated pathway in the liver of these mice due to spaceflight and played an important role in lipid metabolism9. They believed that this regulation in the liver of PPARα due to spaceflight can be an indication of early NAFLD disease progression13,14.Discussion The current investigation demonstrates fluctuations in the temporal patterns of biochemical signal transduction pathways caused by microgravity in three distinct spaceflight datasets (RR1-NASA, RR1-CASIS and RR3) involving RNA-seq and proteomics data analysis compared to microarray data from STS-135. Intriguingly, a subset of the metabolic pathways and molecular factors seem consistent with NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), a multi-factorial metabolic disease that upon progression could lead to NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and finally irreversible liver fibrosis13,14,27. This subset of metabolic pathways include activation of lipid related pathways (in Fig. 3: lipid catabolic process, lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolic process, lipid localization, lipoprotein metabolic process, and regulation of lipid storage), dysregulation of PARR pathways, Apolipoproteins, INS, and GCG (Figs. 3B and 5). Lipid metabolism in spaceflight environments, specifically in the realm of lipid homeostasis, remains largely unclear to date. Mice flown in short mission STS1359, demonstrated major perturbations in key regulatory genes in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Such perturbation is often thought to be the “first-hit” of NAFLD44 characterized by insulin resistance and perturbed fatty acid metabolism leading to liver lipid accumulation and steatosis45. Similarly in this work, histopathological analysis of hepatic lipid content as a biomarker demonstrated marked increase in ORO positivity in all space missions (Fig. 1). Upregulated pathways in these results have a direct impact in dysregulation of the lipids and contribution to increased risk of NAFLD. Our proteomic analysis showed that apolipoproteins were inhibited (Fig. 5). From the literature apolipoproteins have been shown to be involved in the formation of lipoproteins by binding to liver derived lipids and inhibition of the apolipoproteins can result in increased chances of NAFLD46. The upregulation of GCG is known to decrease fatty acid synthesis, synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis, and increase lipolysis in the liver32. GCG and INS are also known to be involved in a feedback loop designed to maintain homeostasis for the blood glucose levels32. Our analysis indicates that INS is indeed upregulated while GCG is downregulated in the liver indicating that there can be an increase in lipid accumulation as we observed with the histology (Figs. 1 and 3). The upregulation of glucose metabolism that we observe has also been reported to contribute to liver disease through disruption of the normal glucose homeostasis that the liver maintains and also involved in insulin resistance47. The cell cycle pathways are observed to be upregulated and it has been reported that during excessive cell division that lipid accumulation can occur in the dividing cells contributing to dysregulation for lipid metabolism48. Lastly, we observe an increase in carbohydrate metabolism which has been reported to be associated with increased rate for the development of NAFLD27. PPARα-mediated pathways were found to be activated in the proteomic data (Fig. 5), and mostly predicted to be downregulated in the transcriptomic data (Fig. 3B). Such downregulation has been associated to the “second-hit” phase of NAFLD known to lead to inflammation and fibrosis, an important pathophysiologic criteria for NASH and irreversible liver fibrosis, which also involve mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress44. In addition, Fgl1 protein was elevated in the spaceflight livers (Fig. 4). This protein has been associated with late-stage NAFLD development and has been observed to have elevated expression in livers from obese patients with NASH49. Other suggestions of the “second hit” mechanism for NAFLD in our data are related to B-cell inhibition, with all datasets (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) (Fig. 3). B-cell regulation has been shown to play a small role with NAFLD progression50. Interestingly, the B-cell inhibition can also be involved with immunosuppression that is observed during spaceflight as discussed by Pecaut et al. for data that was obtained on mice from the STS-135 mission15. In this work, the observed lipid uptake in liver occurred in both strains, with C57Bl/6J showing a stronger response both by histopathology (Fig. 1) and by a stronger separation of ground and flight gene expression by t-SNE plots (Fig. 2). Such observation is consistent with strain susceptibility of early onset of liver disease. For instance, looking at hyperplasia as an early onset of liver disease, it has been shown that C57Bl/6J have a higher spontaneous level of liver hyperplasia than BALB/cByJ, with 15.45% of young mice (16 weeks)30 and 3% of older mice (16–36 months old)51 positive for liver hyperplasia. In contrast, only one study52 reporting on liver hyperplasia in BALB/CByJ showed 0% of hyperplasia in either female or male, looking at bile ducts. In terms of response to treatment, the study30 on younger C57Bl/6J also showed that simply dysregulating the circadian rhythm with modified light cycles was sufficient to increase the level of hyperplasia from 15.45% to 75%. When remembering the difficulty for the animal to stay idle in microgravity53, it is not surprising to see the circadian rhythm being upregulated for all datasets and mouse strains (STS-135, RR1, and RR3) (Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3) and provides a source of stress that have been clearly correlated with liver hyperplasia in mice. Finally, C57BL/6 strain also displays severe phenotype of diet-induced NAFLD/NASH associated liver injury, obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin response through genetic or epigenetic mechanisms compared to BALB/C54,55. Even though everything is done to keep the light cycle as close to Earth as possible in these missions, microgravity most likely modifies sleeping pattern of these mice in space, primarily because of the difficulty for the animal to stay idle in microgravity53. Therefore, circadian rhythm seems to be an additional candidate that can contribute to NAFLD disease progression. We observe through our results that indeed circadian clock pathways are being upregulated for all datasets and mouse strains. (STS-135, RR-1, and RR-3) (Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). In addition to microgravity, there are other factors in space that may also lead to liver disruption. One clear stressor that has been studied extensively in mice are ionizing radiation. However, most radiation studies have been focused on cancer as an endpoint. When searching the literature for the two strains used in our analysis, as observed for hyperplasia, reports were heavily biased towards C57BL/6J. One study56 showed how ionizing radiation elicited liver tumors, with 7.69% hepatocellular adenoma detected 92–94 weeks following 4Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) (Cs-137 source; 2.5Gy/min) at 12–14 weeks of age. Interestingly, in this work, mutating the gene Clock was sufficient to block tumor onset, implicating again circadian rhythm in radiation-induced liver carcinogenesis, and thus suggesting that the combination of space environment and disrupted sleep may work synergistically in enhancing liver disease, potentially including cancer. Another study57 reported 11.11% increase in hepatocellular carcinoma detected 14 months after radiation exposure to unspecified high doses of ionizing radiation. Nothing could be found in the literature regarding Balb/cByJ and radiation-induced liver tumors. One note of caution here in terms of interpretation is that the radiation doses used in the studies listed above are a thousand-fold higher than the two missions considered here. As one can find in GeneLab metadata for RR-1 and RR-3 missions, the total dose received to the animals was about the same in both cases: i.e. ~6.9 mGy delivered chronically over 4 weeks, with 60% of the dose from cosmic radiation instead of low-LET radiation used in the acute dose studies. To conclude, we have identified in this work that NAFLD related pathways are activated in mice flown in space, independently of the strain or the duration of the mission. We suspect that activation of these pathways will persist during longer duration spaceflight missions, will be exacerbated by disrupted sleep resulting in gradual deposition of lipids in the liver and increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and irreversible liver fibrosis. More studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of activation and persistence of this process to infer risks to astronauts.Materials and Method Animal and Sample Collection The omics data for the mouse liver samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository (https://genelab.nasa.gov/)19–21 from previous experiments performed by previous investigators from three spaceflight missions, Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) (with samples from both NASA and CASIS)58,59, and Rodent Research-3 (RR-3)60 and STS-13561. Since we did not perform these experiments and only obtained the data through GeneLab, no Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was required. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each institution and were approved by the institutions Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). We will provide details of the methodology for obtaining the tissues and processing which was done by previous investigators for the readers convenience, but all detailed information is also available on NASA’s GeneLab platform. The STS-135 mission was performed with the NASA AEM-X hardware62, while the RR-1 and RR-3 missions were performed with the new generation of the AEM-X referred to as Rodent Habitat20. The mice for each mission differed in the age and strain, as well as the mission duration. The metadata and experimental design pertaining to each mission was stored in NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab.nasa.gov/)19–21 as GLDS-168: RR-1 NASA59, GLDS-47: RR-1 CASIS58, GLDS-137: RR-360 and GLDS-25 for STS-13561,63. All animals were fed Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. In all experiments, mice that were euthanized on orbit on the ISS were denoted as Flight samples, while mice of similar age, sex and strain housed for a similar number of days in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions, were denoted as Ground control. In the RR-1 mission, after 37 days of launch, five flight animals were euthanized using Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation and frozen as intact whole carcasses and stored in the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) (−80 °C), except for two flight animals which were dissected on-board ISS before livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Upon sample return on SpaceX-4, they were delivered to NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), RR-1 science team collected liver samples among other tissues from NASA frozen intact carcasses for flight and ground (n = 5). The carcasses were taken out from −80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, enough to allow the dissections to proceed. Liver was dissected out and was stored in liquid nitrogen after homogenization for all groups of animals except for two ground samples that were stored in mini cold bag and then in −80 °C freezer. For RR-1 CASIS mission, following 21 days of space travel, mice (n = 3 for each flight and ground control) were euthanized in a similar manner (like RR-1) either on orbit (flight samples) or on ground (ground controls) and the dissected livers were stored in mini cold bags in either MELFI (flight samples) or −80 °C freezer. Mice from RR-3 mission (n = 6 for flight and ground), following 42 days of flight, were euthanized using Ketamine/xylazine injection followed by cervical dislocation. Liver was isolated from frozen carcasses and stored in liquid nitrogen following homogenization. For STS-135, female C57BL/6J mice (n = 6) were placed into Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 days. Ground AEM control mice (n = 6) were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible. Mice were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination and dissected within 3–5 hours of landing.Histology and statistical analysis Histology on samples from the three missions was performed by Triangulum Biopharma LLC (San Diego, CA) on archived tissues available from NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA). In brief, for each sample, one half was embedded in paraffin, while the second half was embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryosectioning. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned at 4 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). OCT-embedded samples were cryosectioned at 5 µm and lipids stained with Oil Red O (ORO). Whole slide imaging was performed in bright field using a Panoramic Scan from 3D Histech and for each slide, marker positive (ORO staining) regions were identified using color deconvolution-based quantification. These identified regions were then quantified for precise positivity using the following metrics - ORO tissue positive area (in mm2) and percent of positively stained tissue area. In samples stained with Oil Red O lipid, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test) was used to analyze differences in percent ORO positivity between flight and ground control samples. We observed high levels of ORO background staining for the RR-1 CASIS samples and we have adjusted accordingly for this during our quantification of the ORO stain.RNA isolation and purification For all samples, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT, lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20–30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately placed in a vial with 800 μL of the RLT solution. Each of these samples were then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature to remove tissue debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to purify DNA and RNA via Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was eluted in 50 μL of DNase- and RNase- free water per sample. RNA was eluted in 30 μL of DNase- and RNase- free water per sample. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA and RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A minimum of 1 µg of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above was sent out for RNA sequencing.Transcriptomics data analysis Microarray transcription profiling data from STS-135 mouse liver samples, obtained from the GeneLab Dataset-25 (GLDS-25), was preprocessed in R using the Affy package. Robust multi-array average (RMA) quantile normalization was performed on the intensity values. Since the dataset contained three different biological groups (Flight samples, Habitat ground controls or AEM, and Vivarium ground controls), we imported the data into MultiExperiment Viewer64 and statistically significant genes was determined by ANOVA analysis between all conditions for GLDS-25 with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. This resulted in 519 significant number genes (with FDR ≤ 0.05) for that were utilized for the remainder of the analysis. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on NASA GLDS-168 and GLDS-47 datasets, which includes both RR1 and RR3 liver data. Specific details on RNA sequencing methods can be found on GeneLab’s platform which was described by the original investigator. Data validation and quality control was performed with FASTQC and Trim Galore! read alignment to the mouse genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner65 generation of gene-level expected count data with RSEM65. The list of software and its versions is as follow: FASTQC version 0.11.8, Trim Galore! Version 0.50, STAR version STAR_2.6.1a_08–27, mouse genome version mm10-GRCm38, RSEM version 1.3.1. The quality of the sequencing step was evaluated with FASTQC, Trim Galore was used to pre-process the expression data by trimming Illumina standard adapter sequences and nucleotides with a quality Phred score below 33. For Differential Expression (DE) analysis, R Version 3.5.1 and DESeq. 2 Version 1.22.2 were used. Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Significantly regulated genes were determined with a FDR ≤ 0.05 for GLDS-168 data using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure and p-value ≤ 0.05 for GLDS-47. For the RR1 and RR3 data from the GLDS-168 there were 5874 genes and 588 significantly regulated genes respectively. For the GLDS-47 RR1: CASIS data there was 1125 significantly regulated genes. For t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots66 we utilized R and performed t-SNE on all the genes and compared the separation between flight and habitat ground samples. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done using the Reactome and C5: Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets with a FDR ≤ 0.05 from the entire list of genes and additional leading edge analysis was performed as described by Subramanian et al.23. All the datasets were compared with “Flight vs Ground Control” samples, the ranked list of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene sets. Pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue were done using the statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥ 1.2 (or ≤ −1.2) comparing flight conditions versus habitat ground controls (with either p-value < 0.05 or FDR < 0.05 as stated above). Low fold-change has become quite standard when trying to identify genes that are differentially expressed67–69, as low cutoffs are less affected by different data normalization schemes and they are less likely to eliminate key genes operating under very tight level regulation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of upstream regulators using activation Z-score statistics ( ≥ 2, activated or ≤ −2, inhibited)70. Heat maps were generated using packages available through R (pheatmap for heat maps).Data processing and statistical analysis for proteomics data The details for the proteomic data acquisition methods for the proteomic data is available on GeneLab which was utilized for this manuscript. Perseus (1.6.2.2) and in-house R scripts were used for proteomics data processing and statistical analysis71. The corrected reporter intensity values generated by MaxQuant were used to analyze the TMT-based proteomics data. Protein groups containing matches to decoy database or contaminants were discarded. Total ion intensity for each reporter ion channel were calculated and matched to correct for the sample loads in each TMT experiment. Only proteins that were quantified in the pooled samples were used for the analysis. Subsequently, internal reference scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT runs using common proteins in pooled internal standards72. The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. Limma was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between groups and volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano package (Bioconductor) to visualize the affected proteins. The affected proteins with p-value of less than 0.05 and log fold change of greater than 1.0 or less than −1.0 were considered significant. For RR3 data from the 2928 proteins 233 proteins were significantly expressed with a p-value ≤ 0.05. For RR1 data from the 2928 proteins 146 proteins were significantly expressed with a p-value ≤ 0.05. The categories with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant.Supplementary information Supplemental Material (5.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the NASA GeneLab Data management team member Samrawit Gebre for her help in curating and managing the experimental database.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts (p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

    "introduction": "Introduction Mechanical loading is essential to skeletal health, because muscle and bone atrophy occur in the setting of disuse. This disuse osteoporosis results in bone loss rates of 1% to 2% per month at weight bearing sites in those exposed to prolonged periods of reduced mechanical loading, such as occurs with paralysis, bed rest during recovery from injury or illness, or spaceflight.1 Current treatments for prevention of disuse osteoporosis rely on anti‐resorptive agents that lower the rate of bone turnover, decreasing both resorption and formation over time. Further, although bisphosphonate therapy inhibits bone loss in astronauts2 and in patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries,3, 4, 5 there is limited evidence of increased BMD, as is normally seen in postmenopausal women treated with bisphosphonates.6 Thus, a treatment that not only inhibits bone resorption but also stimulates bone formation may be desirable in the setting of severe disuse. Intermittent parathyroid hormone, or teriparatide, is the only clinically available treatment that promotes bone formation. However, intermittent PTH therapy also induces bone resorption and in some cases transient hypercalcemia, both of which are undesirable in the setting of disuse, in which negative calcium balance and high calcium excretion are common.1, 7 Given the profound bone loss seen in disuse, treatments that promote bone formation while limiting resorption would be ideal. Previous work demonstrates that a soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2/4 specifically and with high affinity.8 This in turn inhibits dickkopf‐1 (Dkk1) expression in osteoblasts to activate canonical Wnt signaling to promote bone formation. In addition, receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblasts is reduced with the treatment, resulting in decreased bone resorption. Thus, treatment of normal and estrogen‐deficient mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption.8 In this study, we aimed to test the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss using the murine hindlimb unloading model. We hypothesized that mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment would inhibit the bone loss seen in disuse through increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption compared to vehicle‐treated hindlimb unloaded (HLU) counterparts.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Overview of study design Using baseline body mass and total body BMD to minimize group differences, we assigned 12‐week‐old female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to one of two loading groups: HLU or control (CON), and one of two treatment groups: mBMPR1A‐mFc or vehicle (VEH), resulting in four experimental groups (n = 10 each): (i) CON‐VEH; (ii) CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; (iii) HLU‐VEH; and (iv) HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were exposed to HLU via tail suspension for 21 days as described.9 Measurements of body weight and subcutaneous injections of vehicle or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg; Acceleron Pharma, Cambridge, MA, USA) occurred twice per week. Mice were maintained on a 12‐hour/12‐hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. In vivo BMD We used peripheral dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (pDXA) (PIXImusII; GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA) to measure total body (excluding the head region) and hindlimb BMD (g/cm2) in vivo, as described.(9,10) Measurements were acquired at baseline and end of the study. Specimen harvesting and preparation Mice were euthanized via CO2 inhalation. Serum was collected via cardiac puncture at euthanasia, following a 2‐hour fast. After being cleaned of its soft tissue, the right femur was wrapped in saline‐soaked gauze and stored at −20°C until mechanical testing. The left femur was prepared for histology and imaging in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Wet weight of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were obtained at end of study, and normalized to body weight. Histology and quantitative histomorphometry Qualitative histologic analysis and quantitative static and dynamic histomorphometry were performed as described.11 Calcein (15 mg/kg) and demeclocycline (40 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 8 and 2 days, respectively, prior to necropsy to allow for the investigation of bone formation rates. Histomorphometric measurements were performed on the secondary spongiosa of the distal femoral metaphysis using an OsteoMeasure morphometry system (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Static measurements in thin sections stained with Von Kossa/tetrachrome included osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS, %) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS, %). For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS, %) and mineral apposition rate (MAR, μm/day) were measured in unstained sections under ultraviolet light, and used to calculate bone formation rate with a surface referent (BFR/BS, μm3/μm2/day). Terminology and units follow the recommendations of the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).12 Mechanical testing Fresh frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to three‐point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell; Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), with the anterior surface on the two lower support points spaced 8 mm apart and a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s. Force‐displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz and used to determine maximum force (N), stiffness (N/mm), work to failure (N*mm), postyield displacement (mm), and estimated elastic modulus (MPa). Bone microarchitecture We used high‐resolution microcomputed tomography (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) to assess bone morphology and microarchitecture. Briefly, the distal femur and femoral midshaft regions were scanned using 70 kVp, 50 mAs, and 12‐μm isotropic voxel size. We assessed bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), connectivity density (ConnD, 1/mm3), and structure model index (SMI) from a cancellous bone region that spanned 240 μm to 2040 μm distal of the growth plate in the femoral metaphysis region. We obtained the cancellous bone region using a semiautomated contouring program that separated it from the cortical bone. Cortical bone was analyzed from the metaphysis (surrounding the trabecular volume of interest) and from a 0.6‐mm‐long mid‐diaphyseal region. At the femoral midshaft, we assessed total cross sectional area, cortical bone area, and medullary area (TA, BA and MA, respectively, mm2); cortical bone area fraction (Ct.BA/TA, %), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), porosity (Ct.Po, %) and minimum, maximum, and polar moments of inertia (Imin, Imax, and J, respectively, mm4). Bone was segmented from soft tissue using the same threshold for all groups, 267 mg hydroxyapatite (HA)/cm3 for trabecular and 682 mg HA/cm3 for cortical bone. Scanning and analyses adhered to published guidelines.13 Statistical analysis All data were checked for normality, and standard descriptive statistics were computed. Treatment effects were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures ANOVA for all continuous variables, followed by Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) to test for differences between groups. Initial body mass was calculated as the average of body mass measurements made on day 0 and 1, whereas final body mass was the average of measurements made on day 18 or 19 and day 21. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SE, unless noted.",
    "results": "Results Body mass and muscle mass Body mass was unchanged in the CON‐VEH and CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups, whereas both HLU groups experienced a transient decrease in body mass compared to baseline in the first 3 days. However, only the HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc group experienced a small sustained decrease in body weight compared to baseline and to the normally‐loaded control group (–6% compared to CON‐VEH, p < 0.01 for both). As expected, HLU caused significant muscle atrophy in the hindlimb, as the gastrocnemius wet weight normalized to body weight was approximately 15% lower in the HLU‐VEH and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups than in their respective controls (p < 0.01 for both). The soleus had greater atrophy, with a normalized wet weight that was about 40% lower in HLU mice than in fully loaded controls (p < 0.001 for both HLU groups). mBMPR1A‐mFc had no effect on muscle mass (Supporting Table 1). BMD Hindlimb and total body BMD both increased slightly from baseline in CON‐VEH, whereas BMD values declined significantly in the HLU‐VEH group at both sites (Fig. 1). In comparison, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment increased BMD in normally loaded animals and either prevented BMD loss (hindlimb region) or increased BMD (total body) in the HLU group (Fig. 1). Specifically, hindlimb BMD increased 4.4% ± 0.8% in CON‐VEH and declined −5.3% ± 1.3% in the HLU‐VEH group (p < 0.01 versus baseline for both). Hindlimb BMD increased by 10.2% ± 0.6% in normally loaded controls treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (p < 0.01 versus baseline and versus CON‐VEH), whereas hindlimb BMD was maintained in HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Patterns for total body BMD were similar, except that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC in the HLU group led to significantly increased BMD versus baseline, and significantly higher BMD than the HLU‐VEH group (Fig. 1). The increase in total body BMD in mBMPR1A‐mFc treated animals was significantly greater in CON than HLU (p interaction < 0.001). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effect of vehicle (open bars) and mBMPR1A‐mFC (gray bars) treatment on (A) total body BMD, (B) hindlimb BMD, (C) DF trabecular BV/TV, and (D) femoral midshaft cortical thickness in normally loaded (CON) and HLU mice. Horizontal bars show significant differences between CON and HLU mice within treatment group; *p < 0.05 for mBMPR1A‐mFc versus VEH within loading group. Error bars represent 1 SE. DF = distal femur; CON = control; HLU = hindlimb unloaded; VEH = vehicle. Bone microarchitecture Overall, HLU worsened trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFC treatment improved bone microarchitecture in both CON and HLU groups compared to VEH (Table 1, Fig. 1). For example, compared to CON‐VEH, HLU‐VEH had 22% and 14% lower Tb.BV/TV and Tb.Th, respectively (all p < 0.05). In cortical bone, mid‐shaft cortical area was 15% smaller, cortical thickness was 14% thinner, and polar moment of inertia was 16% lower in HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH (all p < 0.05). Trabecular architecture was markedly enhanced in both CON and HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC compared to VEH‐treated mice, with 68% to 82% greater BV/TV, along with greater Tb.Th and connectivity density, and reduced Tb.Sp (all p < 0.05). In both CON and HLU groups, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment also led to improvements in cortical bone microarchitecture at the mid‐diaphysis with 5% to 14% larger cortical bone area, 7% to 8% greater cortical bone area fraction, and 8% to 9% thicker cortical bone (all p < 0.05). These cortical changes appear to be due to endosteal bone apposition, as mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC had lower midshaft medullary area but similar total cross‐sectional area as VEH‐treated groups (Table 1).

Histomorphometry Bone formation was decreased by exposure to HLU, as HLU‐VEH had 50% lower MAR (p < 0.01) and a trend for lower MS/BS (p = 0.09), leading to a 2.8‐fold lower bone formation rate (p < 0.01) compared to CON‐VEH (Fig. 2). HLU‐VEH also tended to have lower osteoblast surface (20% ± 3% in CON‐VEH versus 14% ± 4% in HLU‐VEH, p = 0.17) but had similar osteoclast surface (2.10% ± 0.33% in CON‐VEH versus 2.51% ± 0.41% in HLU‐VEH). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC led to a markedly increased mineralizing surface and MAR, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold increase in bone formation rate in the CON (p = 0.01) and HLU (p = 0.02) animals, respectively (Fig. 3). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC did not affect osteoblast surface, but led to a 60% reduction in osteoclast surface in both the CON (2.10% ± 0.76% in VEH versus 0.76% ± 0.19% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.003) and HLU (2.58% ± 0.41% in VEH versus 1.03% ± 0.12% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.004) groups.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we found that treatment of mice with a soluble mBMPR1A‐mFc fusion protein not only inhibited the bone loss due to HLU, but led to profoundly greater bone mass and strength compared to HLU‐VEH. This suggests that the anabolic effect of mBMPR1A‐mFC treatment was retained despite continuous HLU. Further, dynamic histomorphometry of the trabecular bone compartment demonstrated that increases in bone mass were due to increased bone formation indices and reduced osteoclast surface in both the normally‐loaded and unloaded mBMPR1A‐mFC‐treated mice. The increases in BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone formation rate, and decreases in osteoclast surface seen in the mBMPR1A‐mFC‐treated animals were consistent with those previously reported by Baud'huin and colleagues8 in normal and ovariectomized mice. As in prior reports,9, 10 HLU led to a pronounced decline in bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, accompanied by a marked decrease in bone formation indices. Previous studies in rodents report upregulation of the Wnt‐signaling antagonists SOST and DKK1 following disuse via HLU or Botox injection.14, 15, 16 Further, increased levels of Sost and DKK1 following unloading may also contribute to skeletal deterioration by enhancing osteoclastogenesis via increased levels of the pro‐resorptive cytokine RANKL and decreased levels of the RANKL decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG).17 mBMP1RA‐mFC treatment inhibits DKK1 expression and activates canonical Wnt signaling,8 which in turn prevents skeletal deterioration associated with HLU. We showed that the negative effects of unloading were reversed by inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling via treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein, which led to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture by increased bone formation rate and decreased osteoclast surface. This is consistent with prior work showing that inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling in the postnatal skeleton, either by treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc or by conditional deletion of BMPR1A in osteoblasts, downregulates the expression of Wnt inhibitors Sost and DKK1.8, 18 This subsequent upregulation in Wnt signaling would be expected to increase bone formation and may explain the transient increase in osteoblast number seen with mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment or conditional deletion of BMPR1A in osteoblast lineage cells.8, 19 Inhibition of BMPR1A in osteoclasts may have also contributed to increased bone formation, because Okamoto and colleagues20 reported that conditional deletion of BMPR1A in differentiated osteoclasts led to increased bone formation and decreased osteoclast number and eroded surface in 8‐week‐old mice. We also observed lower osteoclast surface in mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc, an effect that might be mediated indirectly by effects of altered BMP2/4 signaling in osteoblasts or osteocytes, and/or by direct effects on osteoclasts. In support of indirect effects, Baud'huin and colleagues8 reported that inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling through administration of mBMPR1A‐mFc led to decreased serum levels of RANKL and increased levels of OPG. Also, deletion of BMPR1A in osteocytes decreased RANKL and increased OPG mRNA levels.21 Altogether, soluble BMPR1A‐Fc is a potent anabolic agent that promotes bone formation while inhibiting resorption. Our study had several limitations, including the use of a single dosing regimen of mBMPR1A‐mFc and assessment of a single time point. Thus we may have missed early increase in osteoblast surface associated with mBMPR1A‐mFc, as reported by Baud'huin and colleagues8 and/or a transient increase in osteoclast surface due to unloading. Future dose‐ranging studies with additional time points would be helpful in defining the mechanisms that are responsible for the skeletal responses to mBMPR1A‐mFc. These limitations notwithstanding, these results suggest that inhibiting signaling through the endogenous BMPR1A receptor by treatment with a soluble mBMPR1A‐mFc may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse osteoporosis as it increases bone formation and reduces bone resorption. Further work is needed to determine the optimal dose and delineate specific mechanisms underlying these observations.",

Copyright notice ID: 6124165 PMID: 30283882 ABSTRACT Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts (p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

This disuse osteoporosis results in bone loss rates of 1% to 2% per month at weight bearing sites in those exposed to prolonged periods of reduced mechanical loading, such as occurs with paralysis, bed rest during recovery from injury or illness, or spaceflight.1 Current treatments for prevention of disuse osteoporosis rely on anti‐resorptive agents that lower the rate of bone turnover, decreasing both resorption and formation over time. Further, although bisphosphonate therapy inhibits bone loss in astronauts2 and in patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injuries,3, 4, 5 there is limited evidence of increased BMD, as is normally seen in postmenopausal women treated with bisphosphonates.6 Thus, a treatment that not only inhibits bone resorption but also stimulates bone formation may be desirable in the setting of severe disuse. Intermittent parathyroid hormone, or teriparatide, is the only clinically available treatment that promotes bone formation. However, intermittent PTH therapy also induces bone resorption and in some cases transient hypercalcemia, both of which are undesirable in the setting of disuse, in which negative calcium balance and high calcium excretion are common.1, 7 Given the profound bone loss seen in disuse, treatments that promote bone formation while limiting resorption would be ideal. Previous work demonstrates that a soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2/4 specifically and with high affinity.8 This in turn inhibits dickkopf‐1 (Dkk1) expression in osteoblasts to activate canonical Wnt signaling to promote bone formation. In addition, receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteoblasts is reduced with the treatment, resulting in decreased bone resorption. Thus, treatment of normal and estrogen‐deficient mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption.8 In this study, we aimed to test the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss using the murine hindlimb unloading model. We hypothesized that mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment would inhibit the bone loss seen in disuse through increased bone formation and reduced bone resorption compared to vehicle‐treated hindlimb unloaded (HLU) counterparts.Materials and Methods Overview of study design Using baseline body mass and total body BMD to minimize group differences, we assigned 12‐week‐old female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to one of two loading groups: HLU or control (CON), and one of two treatment groups: mBMPR1A‐mFc or vehicle (VEH), resulting in four experimental groups (n = 10 each): (i) CON‐VEH; (ii) CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; (iii) HLU‐VEH; and (iv) HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were exposed to HLU via tail suspension for 21 days as described.9 Measurements of body weight and subcutaneous injections of vehicle or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg; Acceleron Pharma, Cambridge, MA, USA) occurred twice per week. Mice were maintained on a 12‐hour/12‐hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.In vivo BMD We used peripheral dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (pDXA) (PIXImusII; GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA) to measure total body (excluding the head region) and hindlimb BMD (g/cm2) in vivo, as described.(9,10) Measurements were acquired at baseline and end of the study.Specimen harvesting and preparation Mice were euthanized via CO2 inhalation. Serum was collected via cardiac puncture at euthanasia, following a 2‐hour fast. After being cleaned of its soft tissue, the right femur was wrapped in saline‐soaked gauze and stored at −20°C until mechanical testing. The left femur was prepared for histology and imaging in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Wet weight of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were obtained at end of study, and normalized to body weight.Histology and quantitative histomorphometry Qualitative histologic analysis and quantitative static and dynamic histomorphometry were performed as described.11 Calcein (15 mg/kg) and demeclocycline (40 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 8 and 2 days, respectively, prior to necropsy to allow for the investigation of bone formation rates. Histomorphometric measurements were performed on the secondary spongiosa of the distal femoral metaphysis using an OsteoMeasure morphometry system (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Static measurements in thin sections stained with Von Kossa/tetrachrome included osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS, %) and osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS, %). For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface (MS/BS, %) and mineral apposition rate (MAR, μm/day) were measured in unstained sections under ultraviolet light, and used to calculate bone formation rate with a surface referent (BFR/BS, μm3/μm2/day). Terminology and units follow the recommendations of the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).12 Mechanical testing Fresh frozen femurs were thawed and subjected to three‐point bending (Bose ElectroForce 3200 with 150 N load cell; Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), with the anterior surface on the two lower support points spaced 8 mm apart and a constant displacement rate of 0.03 mm/s. Force‐displacement data were acquired at 30 Hz and used to determine maximum force (N), stiffness (N/mm), work to failure (N*mm), postyield displacement (mm), and estimated elastic modulus (MPa).Bone microarchitecture We used high‐resolution microcomputed tomography (μCT40; Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) to assess bone morphology and microarchitecture. Briefly, the distal femur and femoral midshaft regions were scanned using 70 kVp, 50 mAs, and 12‐μm isotropic voxel size. We assessed bone volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), connectivity density (ConnD, 1/mm3), and structure model index (SMI) from a cancellous bone region that spanned 240 μm to 2040 μm distal of the growth plate in the femoral metaphysis region. We obtained the cancellous bone region using a semiautomated contouring program that separated it from the cortical bone. Cortical bone was analyzed from the metaphysis (surrounding the trabecular volume of interest) and from a 0.6‐mm‐long mid‐diaphyseal region. At the femoral midshaft, we assessed total cross sectional area, cortical bone area, and medullary area (TA, BA and MA, respectively, mm2); cortical bone area fraction (Ct.BA/TA, %), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), porosity (Ct.Po, %) and minimum, maximum, and polar moments of inertia (Imin, Imax, and J, respectively, mm4). Bone was segmented from soft tissue using the same threshold for all groups, 267 mg hydroxyapatite (HA)/cm3 for trabecular and 682 mg HA/cm3 for cortical bone. Scanning and analyses adhered to published guidelines.13 Statistical analysis All data were checked for normality, and standard descriptive statistics were computed. Treatment effects were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated measures ANOVA for all continuous variables, followed by Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) to test for differences between groups. Initial body mass was calculated as the average of body mass measurements made on day 0 and 1, whereas final body mass was the average of measurements made on day 18 or 19 and day 21. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SE, unless noted.Results Body mass and muscle mass Body mass was unchanged in the CON‐VEH and CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups, whereas both HLU groups experienced a transient decrease in body mass compared to baseline in the first 3 days. However, only the HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc group experienced a small sustained decrease in body weight compared to baseline and to the normally‐loaded control group (–6% compared to CON‐VEH, p < 0.01 for both). As expected, HLU caused significant muscle atrophy in the hindlimb, as the gastrocnemius wet weight normalized to body weight was approximately 15% lower in the HLU‐VEH and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups than in their respective controls (p < 0.01 for both). The soleus had greater atrophy, with a normalized wet weight that was about 40% lower in HLU mice than in fully loaded controls (p < 0.001 for both HLU groups). mBMPR1A‐mFc had no effect on muscle mass (Supporting Table 1).BMD Hindlimb and total body BMD both increased slightly from baseline in CON‐VEH, whereas BMD values declined significantly in the HLU‐VEH group at both sites (Fig. 1). In comparison, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment increased BMD in normally loaded animals and either prevented BMD loss (hindlimb region) or increased BMD (total body) in the HLU group (Fig. 1). Specifically, hindlimb BMD increased 4.4% ± 0.8% in CON‐VEH and declined −5.3% ± 1.3% in the HLU‐VEH group (p < 0.01 versus baseline for both). Hindlimb BMD increased by 10.2% ± 0.6% in normally loaded controls treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (p < 0.01 versus baseline and versus CON‐VEH), whereas hindlimb BMD was maintained in HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc (0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Patterns for total body BMD were similar, except that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC in the HLU group led to significantly increased BMD versus baseline, and significantly higher BMD than the HLU‐VEH group (Fig. 1). The increase in total body BMD in mBMPR1A‐mFc treated animals was significantly greater in CON than HLU (p interaction < 0.001). Figure 1.

DF = distal femur; CON = control; HLU = hindlimb unloaded; VEH = vehicle.Bone microarchitecture Overall, HLU worsened trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFC treatment improved bone microarchitecture in both CON and HLU groups compared to VEH (Table 1, Fig. 1). For example, compared to CON‐VEH, HLU‐VEH had 22% and 14% lower Tb.BV/TV and Tb.Th, respectively (all p < 0.05). In cortical bone, mid‐shaft cortical area was 15% smaller, cortical thickness was 14% thinner, and polar moment of inertia was 16% lower in HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH (all p < 0.05). Trabecular architecture was markedly enhanced in both CON and HLU mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC compared to VEH‐treated mice, with 68% to 82% greater BV/TV, along with greater Tb.Th and connectivity density, and reduced Tb.Sp (all p < 0.05). In both CON and HLU groups, mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment also led to improvements in cortical bone microarchitecture at the mid‐diaphysis with 5% to 14% larger cortical bone area, 7% to 8% greater cortical bone area fraction, and 8% to 9% thicker cortical bone (all p < 0.05). These cortical changes appear to be due to endosteal bone apposition, as mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFC had lower midshaft medullary area but similar total cross‐sectional area as VEH‐treated groups (Table 1).

Histomorphometry Bone formation was decreased by exposure to HLU, as HLU‐VEH had 50% lower MAR (p < 0.01) and a trend for lower MS/BS (p = 0.09), leading to a 2.8‐fold lower bone formation rate (p < 0.01) compared to CON‐VEH (Fig. 2). HLU‐VEH also tended to have lower osteoblast surface (20% ± 3% in CON‐VEH versus 14% ± 4% in HLU‐VEH, p = 0.17) but had similar osteoclast surface (2.10% ± 0.33% in CON‐VEH versus 2.51% ± 0.41% in HLU‐VEH). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC led to a markedly increased mineralizing surface and MAR, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold increase in bone formation rate in the CON (p = 0.01) and HLU (p = 0.02) animals, respectively (Fig. 3). Treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFC did not affect osteoblast surface, but led to a 60% reduction in osteoclast surface in both the CON (2.10% ± 0.76% in VEH versus 0.76% ± 0.19% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.003) and HLU (2.58% ± 0.41% in VEH versus 1.03% ± 0.12% in mBMPR1A‐mFC, p = 0.004) groups.

Note the increased distance between labels in mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc, indicative of the increased mineral apposition rate. Images acquired under fluorescent light at magnification ×400. HLU = hindlimb unloaded.Discussion In this study, we found that treatment of mice with a soluble mBMPR1A‐mFc fusion protein not only inhibited the bone loss due to HLU, but led to profoundly greater bone mass and strength compared to HLU‐VEH. This suggests that the anabolic effect of mBMPR1A‐mFC treatment was retained despite continuous HLU. Further, dynamic histomorphometry of the trabecular bone compartment demonstrated that increases in bone mass were due to increased bone formation indices and reduced osteoclast surface in both the normally‐loaded and unloaded mBMPR1A‐mFC‐treated mice. The increases in BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone formation rate, and decreases in osteoclast surface seen in the mBMPR1A‐mFC‐treated animals were consistent with those previously reported by Baud'huin and colleagues8 in normal and ovariectomized mice. As in prior reports,9, 10 HLU led to a pronounced decline in bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, accompanied by a marked decrease in bone formation indices. Previous studies in rodents report upregulation of the Wnt‐signaling antagonists SOST and DKK1 following disuse via HLU or Botox injection.14, 15, 16 Further, increased levels of Sost and DKK1 following unloading may also contribute to skeletal deterioration by enhancing osteoclastogenesis via increased levels of the pro‐resorptive cytokine RANKL and decreased levels of the RANKL decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG).17 mBMP1RA‐mFC treatment inhibits DKK1 expression and activates canonical Wnt signaling,8 which in turn prevents skeletal deterioration associated with HLU. We showed that the negative effects of unloading were reversed by inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling via treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein, which led to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture by increased bone formation rate and decreased osteoclast surface. This is consistent with prior work showing that inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling in the postnatal skeleton, either by treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc or by conditional deletion of BMPR1A in osteoblasts, downregulates the expression of Wnt inhibitors Sost and DKK1.8, 18 This subsequent upregulation in Wnt signaling would be expected to increase bone formation and may explain the transient increase in osteoblast number seen with mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment or conditional deletion of BMPR1A in osteoblast lineage cells.8, 19 Inhibition of BMPR1A in osteoclasts may have also contributed to increased bone formation, because Okamoto and colleagues20 reported that conditional deletion of BMPR1A in differentiated osteoclasts led to increased bone formation and decreased osteoclast number and eroded surface in 8‐week‐old mice. We also observed lower osteoclast surface in mice treated with mBMPR1A‐mFc, an effect that might be mediated indirectly by effects of altered BMP2/4 signaling in osteoblasts or osteocytes, and/or by direct effects on osteoclasts. In support of indirect effects, Baud'huin and colleagues8 reported that inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling through administration of mBMPR1A‐mFc led to decreased serum levels of RANKL and increased levels of OPG. Also, deletion of BMPR1A in osteocytes decreased RANKL and increased OPG mRNA levels.21 Altogether, soluble BMPR1A‐Fc is a potent anabolic agent that promotes bone formation while inhibiting resorption. Our study had several limitations, including the use of a single dosing regimen of mBMPR1A‐mFc and assessment of a single time point. Thus we may have missed early increase in osteoblast surface associated with mBMPR1A‐mFc, as reported by Baud'huin and colleagues8 and/or a transient increase in osteoclast surface due to unloading. Future dose‐ranging studies with additional time points would be helpful in defining the mechanisms that are responsible for the skeletal responses to mBMPR1A‐mFc. These limitations notwithstanding, these results suggest that inhibiting signaling through the endogenous BMPR1A receptor by treatment with a soluble mBMPR1A‐mFc may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse osteoporosis as it increases bone formation and reduces bone resorption. Further work is needed to determine the optimal dose and delineate specific mechanisms underlying these observations.Disclosures Dr. Bousein is a consultant for Acceleron Pharma.

    "abstract": "Abstract Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Mechanical loading plays an important role during musculoskeletal development and maintenance. Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures. Biological mechanisms underlying skeletal deterioration due to reduced mechanical loading have been studied using hindlimb unloading rodent models, which demonstrated altered Wnt or IGF signaling or Rank/Rankl/Opg pathway [1–5]. These studies led to several clinical studies that explored the usage of existing or newly developed pharmacological therapies to counter immobilization or spaceflight induced bone loss [6,7]. While prior studies in rodent models demonstrated signaling pathways that contribute to skeletal loss from reduced mechanical loading, limited candidate gene approached precluded exploration of other novel pathways that may also play an important role. Recent advances in whole transcriptome RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) allow comprehensive, quantitative, and unbiased view of the complete RNA transcriptome. This high-throughput approach can allow identification novel pathways that are altered in response to reduced mechanical loading in rodent models. Prior studies in transgenic mice or mice that underwent increased mechanical loading successfully demonstrated alterations in novel pathways in osteocytes using RNAseq [8,9]. However, no studies to date examined whole transcriptome profile of osteocytes from mice that underwent reduced mechanical loading. Thus, we examined the complete RNA transcriptome in cortical bone from mice that underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days, with the goal of identifying novel mechanosensitive pathways that respond to mechanical unloading. We validated our RNAseq results by a highly sensitive RNA molecular barcoding technologies (NanoString) examining 60 panel genes.",

    "results": "Results Hindlimb unloading did not alter the quality of RNAseq data. For both groups, individual specimens yielded ~22 million reads with high unique mapping rates (79% for controls and 81% for HLU). RNAseq analysis of cortical bone mRNA from control and HLU mice, without correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, identified 723 genes whose transcript abundances increased ≥ 1.2-fold and 610 genes whose transcript abundances decreased ≥ 1.2-fold. After considering genes whose transcript abundances changed by 1.2-fold and correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (p < 0.1), 8 genes demonstrated increased transcript abundance and 5 genes demonstrated decreased transcript abundance following HLU. Gene set enrichment analysis using these 13 differentially expressed genes pointed to several metabolic processes, monosaccharide metabolism (Pfkfb3, Igfbp5, p < 0.01), peptidase inhibition (Stfa1, Stfa2, p < 0.01), and cellular protein metabolism (Stfa2, Stfa1, Igfbp5, p < 0.01). Wnt signaling was also implicated (Fig 1). Fig 1. Selected KEGG pathway and gene ontology of biological process altered in cortical bone from hindlimb unloaded mice and the effects of HLU on Wnt signaling and Pfkfb3. Open in a new tab Transcript abundances measured by RNAseq and Nanostring were similar in control mice (Pearson’s R = 0.90, p < 0.0001, Fig 2A). Changes in transcript abundance between control and HLU mice also correlated significantly between the RNAseq and Nanostring datasets (Pearson’s R = 0.76, p < 0.0001, Fig 2B). Importantly, Nanostring confirmed alterations seen with RNAseq in transcripts associated with Wnt signaling and cell metabolism (Table 1, Fig 3). Scd1 (2-fold, p = 0.01), Pfkfb3 (1.8-fold, p = 0.003), and Fzd4 (1.6-fold, p = 0.03) were all upregulated in cortical bone isolated from hindlimb unloaded mouse. In addition to these genes, we identified Mmp3 (1.8-fold, p = 0.007), Sfrp2 (1.7-fold, p = 0.05), Sfrp4 (1.7-fold, p = 0.009), Mmp13 (1.6-fold, p = 0.01), Bmp4 (1.4-fold, p = 0.02), Timp1 (1.5-fold, p = 0.02), Npy (1.2-fold, p = 0.04), and Spp1 (1.5-fold, p = 0.02) genes to be upregulated in the hindlimb unloaded mouse cortical bone.

    "discussion": "Discussion Our RNAseq dataset provides an unbiased approach for identifying genes whose transcripts change in response to mechanical unloading of cortical bone. We identified novel genes (e.g., Mss51, Pfkfb3) related to cell cycle, mitochondria, and cellular energy balance that were differentially regulated by HLU. While mitochondria are typically reduced in size as osteoblasts transition to osteocytes, histopathological studies demonstrate enlarged mitochondria in osteocytes from rats immobilized for ten days [20]. Further, in mice with impaired osteocyte autophagy, enlarged mitochondria are observed as well, and associated with decreased trabecular and cortical bone [21]. Imbalance in osteocyte mitochondrial redox can disrupt the canalicular network and lead to bone loss [22]. Further studies are needed to determine whether the genes we identified may sense altered mechanical loading through a similar mechanism that regulates cellular energy balance in bone. Prior studies have also demonstrated that microgravity causes alterations to glycolysis pathways in a variety of cells, including osteoblasts [23,24]. Importantly, our data show that Pfkfb3, which controls the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, is significantly upregulated after HLU. Recent evidence supports the concept that Pfkfb3 provides a signaling mechanism for Wnt3A, altering osteoblast differentiation [25]. Pfkfb3 was also identified de-novo in a gene enrichment analysis of circulating monocytes in patients with osteoporosis, further suggesting a possible role in modulating the bone microenvironment in the setting of low bone density [26]. Our study adds to the evidence that Pfkfb3 may influence bone metabolism in the context of microgravity, disuse-induced bone loss and osteoporosis. Mss51 has not been demonstrated to be involved during skeletal development or homeostasis, but recently published study suggests that Mss51 may be involved in bone adaptation following mechanical loading [27]. The alteration in Mss51 appears to be mediated by focal adhesion kinase, which has been shown to be responsive to mechanical loading via fluid flow shear stress in osteoblasts [28,29]. Mechanical loading likely alters cell-matrix environment, thereby allowing integrins to initiate intracellular signaling to promote bone adaptation. Hindlimb unloading in rats also decreases focal adhesions in mesenchymal stromal cells [30], which will have resulted in increased Mss51 [27]. These studies demonstrate that while Mss51 is conventionally known to be involved during cell metabolism and energy balance, the gene may also be responsive to mechanical loading/unloading via changes in cell-matrix environment. Prior studies of hindlimb unloading in rodents have reported that several signaling pathways such as Wnt and Rankl/Opg are altered in osteoblasts and osteocytes following mechanical unloading [31–34]. While our study demonstrated that Wnt signaling is implicated to be involved, we did not find that sclerostin or Rankl/Opg to be altered following hindlimb unloading. There are several possible factors that may have contributed to differences in study findings. First, it is possible that methodological differences (RNAseq vs. RT-qPCR) used to assess transcript levels contributed to different outcomes. Second, while we carefully removed bone marrow, surrounding soft tissues, and both ends of bone, the cortical bone lining cells may have contributed to heterogeneity of cell population, leading to blunted effects on several signaling pathways known to be altered by hindlimb unloading in osteocytes or osteoblasts. In addition, whereas we examined day 7 of unloading, earlier time points may be needed to observe robust differences in gene expression due to unloading. Prior studies have demonstrated that bones from 6 to 9 months old rats are more responsive to hindlimb unloading than 28 to 32 months old rats, likely due to increased Bmp2 and Igf1 in younger animals [35,36]. Finally, hindlimb unloading has been shown to affect other physiologic systems in female 11-week-old mice, such as loss of muscle and increased corticosterone metabolites [37], which has been shown to inhibit bone formation [38]. Altogether, a variety of factors can contribute to inconsistencies in gene expression across studies. Additional suitably powered and well-controlled studies are needed to resolve reported discrepancies among studies. We used only female mice, thus precluding analysis of possible sexual dimorphism in mechanosensitive genes. We selected the 7-day timepoint based on our prior studies, but recognize the limitation of this approach which precludes determining the time-course of gene-expression changes. This early timepoint may have led to minimal changes in osteogenic genes in our studies. However, our ability to identify novel genes that may initiate osteogenic responses later, not previously associated with disuse-induced bone loss provides rationale for future studies with multiple timepoints to expand upon the current findings. While there was excellent correlation between the measurements performed with two methods (Fig 2), Nanostring detected more differentially expressed genes than RNAseq (Fig 3). Therefore, although Nanostring can sample a limited, pre-determined portion of cortical bone transcriptome, it can serve as a powerful approach towards identifying mild changes (<2-fold) in transcript abundance. Our gene expression approach comparing cortical bone gene expression in HLU and normally loaded mice successfully revealed previously known and unknown genes. Future mechanistic studies examining the functional role of metabolic genes revealed from our study may identify novel mechanosensitive pathways responsible for microgravity- and disuse-induced bone loss.

Copyright notice ID: 8509868 PMID: 34637435 Abstract Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.Introduction Mechanical loading plays an important role during musculoskeletal development and maintenance. Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures. Biological mechanisms underlying skeletal deterioration due to reduced mechanical loading have been studied using hindlimb unloading rodent models, which demonstrated altered Wnt or IGF signaling or Rank/Rankl/Opg pathway [1–5]. These studies led to several clinical studies that explored the usage of existing or newly developed pharmacological therapies to counter immobilization or spaceflight induced bone loss [6,7]. While prior studies in rodent models demonstrated signaling pathways that contribute to skeletal loss from reduced mechanical loading, limited candidate gene approached precluded exploration of other novel pathways that may also play an important role. Recent advances in whole transcriptome RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) allow comprehensive, quantitative, and unbiased view of the complete RNA transcriptome. This high-throughput approach can allow identification novel pathways that are altered in response to reduced mechanical loading in rodent models. Prior studies in transgenic mice or mice that underwent increased mechanical loading successfully demonstrated alterations in novel pathways in osteocytes using RNAseq [8,9]. However, no studies to date examined whole transcriptome profile of osteocytes from mice that underwent reduced mechanical loading. Thus, we examined the complete RNA transcriptome in cortical bone from mice that underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days, with the goal of identifying novel mechanosensitive pathways that respond to mechanical unloading. We validated our RNAseq results by a highly sensitive RNA molecular barcoding technologies (NanoString) examining 60 panel genes.Material and methods Hindlimb unloading Eleven-week old, female C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to hindlimb unloading (HLU) or normal weightbearing (Cont) (n = 8/group). The HLU group underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days according to the previously published studies [10–15]. In brief, under isoflurane anesthesia, the mouse tail was taped to a freely rotating harness connected to a wheel that moved along the central axis of the custom-made cage. The harness was adjusted such that the mouse could not touch its hind limbs to the floor or the walls of the cage. Mice were maintained on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle, had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation at the end of the experiment. All animal procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.RNAseq After cutting the ends of bones and flushing marrow with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline, the cortical bone was placed in an Eppendorf tube and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, Trizol was added while the bone is maintained frozen in an eppendorf tube placed in a liquid nitrogen bath, homogenized in the same eppendorf tube with the Fastprep24 machine (MP Biomdicals), and subsequently total RNA was isolated and purified using manufacture recommendations for the PureLink RNA kit (Life Technologies). Using this isolation technique, we routinely obtain 3–6 ug per sample total RNA that has high quality RNA integrity numbers (RIN, Aigilent Technologies) > 7.5 [9]. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (v2, Illumina, San Diego, CA) per manufacturer recommendations using 500 ng/sample total RNA [8]. Samples were multiplexed (n = 8 per lane) for sequencing on a HiSeq (Illumina) platform and reads were aligned to reference genome (Tophat2). Differential gene expression was analyzed by DESeq2 and relevant biological processes associated with differentially expressed genes were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis according to studies by Subramanian et al. [8,16–18].Nanostring To validate our set of differentially regulated genes identified by RNASeq. and to perform targeted gene discovery in our unloading model using the limiting amount of total RNA (3–6 ug/sample) we isolated from murine femurs, we used a NanoString nCounter codeset of sixty differentially expressed genes (Table 1) with 6 housekeeping genes (Actb, Abcf1, B2m, Gapdh, Pol42A, Sirt4). In brief, the nCounter gene codeset contains a matched pair 3′ biotinylated capture probe and a 5′reporter probe tagged with a fluorescent barcode, for each of 236 transcripts. Probes are hybridized to 100 ng of total RNA for 19 h at 65°C, after which excess capture and reporter probes are removed and transcript-specific ternary complexes are immobilized on a streptavidin-coated cartridge. Subsequently, all solution manipulations are carried out using the NanoString preparation station robotic fluids handling platform. Data collection is carried out with the nCounter Digital Analyzer to count individual fluorescent barcodes and quantify target RNA molecules present in each sample. Normalization was carried based on a standard curve constructed using spike in exogenous control constructs and the 6 housekeeping genes included in the codeset [19]. Table 1.

For both groups, individual specimens yielded ~22 million reads with high unique mapping rates (79% for controls and 81% for HLU). RNAseq analysis of cortical bone mRNA from control and HLU mice, without correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, identified 723 genes whose transcript abundances increased ≥ 1.2-fold and 610 genes whose transcript abundances decreased ≥ 1.2-fold. After considering genes whose transcript abundances changed by 1.2-fold and correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (p < 0.1), 8 genes demonstrated increased transcript abundance and 5 genes demonstrated decreased transcript abundance following HLU. Gene set enrichment analysis using these 13 differentially expressed genes pointed to several metabolic processes, monosaccharide metabolism (Pfkfb3, Igfbp5, p < 0.01), peptidase inhibition (Stfa1, Stfa2, p < 0.01), and cellular protein metabolism (Stfa2, Stfa1, Igfbp5, p < 0.01). Wnt signaling was also implicated (Fig 1). Fig 1.

Open in a new tabTranscript abundances measured by RNAseq and Nanostring were similar in control mice (Pearson’s R = 0.90, p < 0.0001, Fig 2A). Changes in transcript abundance between control and HLU mice also correlated significantly between the RNAseq and Nanostring datasets (Pearson’s R = 0.76, p < 0.0001, Fig 2B). Importantly, Nanostring confirmed alterations seen with RNAseq in transcripts associated with Wnt signaling and cell metabolism (Table 1, Fig 3). Scd1 (2-fold, p = 0.01), Pfkfb3 (1.8-fold, p = 0.003), and Fzd4 (1.6-fold, p = 0.03) were all upregulated in cortical bone isolated from hindlimb unloaded mouse. In addition to these genes, we identified Mmp3 (1.8-fold, p = 0.007), Sfrp2 (1.7-fold, p = 0.05), Sfrp4 (1.7-fold, p = 0.009), Mmp13 (1.6-fold, p = 0.01), Bmp4 (1.4-fold, p = 0.02), Timp1 (1.5-fold, p = 0.02), Npy (1.2-fold, p = 0.04), and Spp1 (1.5-fold, p = 0.02) genes to be upregulated in the hindlimb unloaded mouse cortical bone. No downregulated genes were detected. Fig 2.

Open in a new tabDiscussion Our RNAseq dataset provides an unbiased approach for identifying genes whose transcripts change in response to mechanical unloading of cortical bone. We identified novel genes (e.g., Mss51, Pfkfb3) related to cell cycle, mitochondria, and cellular energy balance that were differentially regulated by HLU. While mitochondria are typically reduced in size as osteoblasts transition to osteocytes, histopathological studies demonstrate enlarged mitochondria in osteocytes from rats immobilized for ten days [20]. Further, in mice with impaired osteocyte autophagy, enlarged mitochondria are observed as well, and associated with decreased trabecular and cortical bone [21]. Imbalance in osteocyte mitochondrial redox can disrupt the canalicular network and lead to bone loss [22]. Further studies are needed to determine whether the genes we identified may sense altered mechanical loading through a similar mechanism that regulates cellular energy balance in bone. Prior studies have also demonstrated that microgravity causes alterations to glycolysis pathways in a variety of cells, including osteoblasts [23,24]. Importantly, our data show that Pfkfb3, which controls the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, is significantly upregulated after HLU. Recent evidence supports the concept that Pfkfb3 provides a signaling mechanism for Wnt3A, altering osteoblast differentiation [25]. Pfkfb3 was also identified de-novo in a gene enrichment analysis of circulating monocytes in patients with osteoporosis, further suggesting a possible role in modulating the bone microenvironment in the setting of low bone density [26]. Our study adds to the evidence that Pfkfb3 may influence bone metabolism in the context of microgravity, disuse-induced bone loss and osteoporosis. Mss51 has not been demonstrated to be involved during skeletal development or homeostasis, but recently published study suggests that Mss51 may be involved in bone adaptation following mechanical loading [27]. The alteration in Mss51 appears to be mediated by focal adhesion kinase, which has been shown to be responsive to mechanical loading via fluid flow shear stress in osteoblasts [28,29]. Mechanical loading likely alters cell-matrix environment, thereby allowing integrins to initiate intracellular signaling to promote bone adaptation. Hindlimb unloading in rats also decreases focal adhesions in mesenchymal stromal cells [30], which will have resulted in increased Mss51 [27]. These studies demonstrate that while Mss51 is conventionally known to be involved during cell metabolism and energy balance, the gene may also be responsive to mechanical loading/unloading via changes in cell-matrix environment. Prior studies of hindlimb unloading in rodents have reported that several signaling pathways such as Wnt and Rankl/Opg are altered in osteoblasts and osteocytes following mechanical unloading [31–34]. While our study demonstrated that Wnt signaling is implicated to be involved, we did not find that sclerostin or Rankl/Opg to be altered following hindlimb unloading. There are several possible factors that may have contributed to differences in study findings. First, it is possible that methodological differences (RNAseq vs. RT-qPCR) used to assess transcript levels contributed to different outcomes. Second, while we carefully removed bone marrow, surrounding soft tissues, and both ends of bone, the cortical bone lining cells may have contributed to heterogeneity of cell population, leading to blunted effects on several signaling pathways known to be altered by hindlimb unloading in osteocytes or osteoblasts. In addition, whereas we examined day 7 of unloading, earlier time points may be needed to observe robust differences in gene expression due to unloading. Prior studies have demonstrated that bones from 6 to 9 months old rats are more responsive to hindlimb unloading than 28 to 32 months old rats, likely due to increased Bmp2 and Igf1 in younger animals [35,36]. Finally, hindlimb unloading has been shown to affect other physiologic systems in female 11-week-old mice, such as loss of muscle and increased corticosterone metabolites [37], which has been shown to inhibit bone formation [38]. Altogether, a variety of factors can contribute to inconsistencies in gene expression across studies. Additional suitably powered and well-controlled studies are needed to resolve reported discrepancies among studies. We used only female mice, thus precluding analysis of possible sexual dimorphism in mechanosensitive genes. We selected the 7-day timepoint based on our prior studies, but recognize the limitation of this approach which precludes determining the time-course of gene-expression changes. This early timepoint may have led to minimal changes in osteogenic genes in our studies. However, our ability to identify novel genes that may initiate osteogenic responses later, not previously associated with disuse-induced bone loss provides rationale for future studies with multiple timepoints to expand upon the current findings. While there was excellent correlation between the measurements performed with two methods (Fig 2), Nanostring detected more differentially expressed genes than RNAseq (Fig 3). Therefore, although Nanostring can sample a limited, pre-determined portion of cortical bone transcriptome, it can serve as a powerful approach towards identifying mild changes (<2-fold) in transcript abundance. Our gene expression approach comparing cortical bone gene expression in HLU and normally loaded mice successfully revealed previously known and unknown genes. Future mechanistic studies examining the functional role of metabolic genes revealed from our study may identify novel mechanosensitive pathways responsible for microgravity- and disuse-induced bone loss. Elucidating these pathways may lead to therapeutic interventions to treat bone loss and prevent fracture risk associated with microgravity, spinal cord injury, or extended bed rest.Supporting information S1 File.
