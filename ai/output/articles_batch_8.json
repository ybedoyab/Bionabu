Copyright notice ID: 4453782 PMID: 25883241 Four leading cell biologists reflect on the controversial nature of the vector for transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus in higher plants.Abstract The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast. Cell biology textbooks usually give a description of the Golgi apparatus as it is seen and functions in a mammalian cell. This is understandable considering the huge body of literature on this organelle in animal cells, especially in relation to disease. It also reflects and is designed to accommodate the large readership from the medical sciences. With few exceptions (Ito et al., 2014), there are few reviews on the Golgi apparatus that give a balanced account of its structure and function across the whole eukaryotic kingdom. The plant Golgi apparatus is nevertheless a fascinating organelle that has unique features, especially when compared with its mammalian counterpart. It is polydisperse rather than being present as a continuous perinuclear ribbon, it does not disassemble during mitosis, and it is motile. These characteristics are of great importance, especially because Golgi stacks in plants, along with their protein processing functions, have been termed polysaccharide factories and their activity is essential for formation of a cell wall during cytokinesis and growth. Nevertheless, it is Golgi stack motility that makes bidirectional protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus in plants conceptually more difficult to grasp and therefore even more intriguing than others in other eukaryotic kingdoms. There is general consensus that in all eukaryotes, anterograde protein transport out of the ER is largely dependent upon Coat Protein II (COII) proteins and that retrograde transport both within the Golgi stack and between the Golgi and the ER requires COPI proteins (Szul and Sztul, 2011; Barlowe and Miller, 2013). Because recruitment of proteins in yeasts and mammals culminates in the formation of a transport vesicle, it is logical to assume that this may also be the case for plants. However, whereas there appears to be no doubt about the formation and release of COPI vesicles at the periphery of plant Golgi cisternae (Pimpl et al., 2000; Donohoe et al., 2007), the existence of COPII-coated vesicles and their operation as anterograde transport vectors in the narrow (less than 500 nm) interface between the ER and Golgi apparatus of land plants is a matter of considerable controversy (Hawes et al., 2008; Hawes, 2012). By contrast, there are numerous examples among lower eukaryotes where electron micrographs reveal a Golgi stack immediately adjacent (less than 500 nm) to transitional ER, per definition, a domain of the ER (or nuclear envelope) showing vesicle budding profiles and lacking ribosomes. The best examples for this are probably the yeast Pichia pastoris (Mogelsvang et al., 2003) and the algae Chlamydomonas noctigama (Fig. 1, A and B; Hummel et al., 2007), Tribonema vulgare, and Melosira varians (see Getty Images nos. 169272449 and 128618249; www.gettyimages.com). ER vesiculation profiles have often been recorded for mammalian cells going right back to the early papers of George Palade (for references, see Tartakoff, 2002). Interestingly, in all of these cases, as with the algae just mentioned, classical chemical fixation was sufficient to obtain the images. Therefore, one would expect that higher plants would be no different in this regard. Unexpectedly, this is not the case. So far, only in rapidly frozen samples has it been possible to visualize ER vesiculation profiles. Even then, such images are rare (Fig. 1, C and D; Robinson et al., 2007; Kang and Staehelin, 2008; Langhans et al., 2012). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Electron microscopy of COPII budding. A and B, Transitional ER plus adjacent Golgi stacks in the green alga C. noctigama as seen in chemically fixed (A) and high-pressure frozen samples (B).

D to G, Collage of COPII budding profiles. Note that many of the buds are at the termini of ER cisternae. Note that the ER in high-pressure frozen samples is, in general, much more dilated than in chemically fixed samples; in C. noctigama, it is extremely dilated (the ER in B can be recognized by the ribosomes at the left of the vacuole-like structure). Bars = 200 nm.Golgi stacks are invariably associated with tubular ER and only rarely with the edges of cisternae (Sparkes et al., 2009b). Moreover, in highly vacuolated plant cells such as in the leaf epidermis, Golgi stacks move (several micrometers per second) in a stop-and-go fashion along the surface of the ER (Boevink et al., 1998; Nebenführ et al., 1999). This contrasts with the situation in mammalian cells and in the aforementioned algae, where the ER and the Golgi are more or less stationary. So is perhaps Golgi motility the clue to the controversy surrounding COPII vesicle identification in higher plants? The only alternative to vesicle-mediated transport is through some form of interconnecting tubules, either permanent or more probably temporal in nature. If so, the early secretory pathway of plants would appear to be fundamentally different from that of other eukaryotes. The purpose of this article is to examine whether this conclusion is warranted and valid. Four scientists who have made major contributions in this area have come together to give their views on the matter. However, their divergent opinions have precluded a joint review. It was therefore decided that their opinions should appear separately. Our paper starts with a contribution from Federica Brandizzi who sets the scene at the molecular level, followed by two articles: one summarizing the data pro tubules (from Chris Hawes) and the other arguing in favor of vesicles (from David Robinson). The final article is from Aki Nakano, whose recent successful application of super high-resolution microscopy on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) allows for new insights into ER-Golgi trafficking in higher plants. We believe that the plant sciences community cannot fail to benefit from witnessing how four experienced cell biologists perceive the current state of play in this controversy. Although being unable to come to a final agreement on this issue, we dwell in the “Conclusion” on further possible courses of action. FEDERICA BRANDIZZI: THE SECRETORY UNITS MODEL FOR ER PROTEIN TRANSPORT IN HIGHLY VACUOLATED CELLS In live-cell imaging analyses, the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) COPII coat components (Sec13, Sec23, Sec24, and Sec31), when expressed in highly vacuolated leaf epidermal cells in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis, have been found in punctate structures that are associated with the ER and move with the Golgi stacks (Stefano et al., 2006; Hanton et al., 2007, 2009; Sieben et al., 2008; Wei and Wang, 2008; Faso et al., 2009; Takagi et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2013), which, in fully expanded plant cells, are highly dispersed and motile (Boevink et al., 1998; Stefano et al., 2014). The punctae labeled by the COPII coat proteins are commonly indicated as ER exit sites (ERESs). With the exception of Sec13, which has also been found at the nuclear envelope (Yang et al., 2005), Sec23, Sec24, and Sec31 are predominantly localized at such areas. Three-dimensional projection reconstruction of confocal images followed by rendering analyses have shown that Sec16 is localized in cup-like structures where the ER assumes a high-degree curvature (Takagi et al., 2013; Fig. 2), supporting the intriguing possibility for specific requirements of ER membrane curvature for the ERES establishment and maintenance. In a Sec24A partial loss-of-function mutant, a functional fluorescent protein fusion to Sec24A has been identified also in bright structures of unknown identity (Faso et al., 2009). It has been hypothesized that such structures may represent ERESs in formation or protein aggregates (Faso et al., 2009). The COPII-recruiting guanosine triphosphate hydrolyzing-protein (GTPase) Sar1 has been found at the ERESs but also over the ER network to a variable degree that may depend on the specific Sar1 isoform (Hanton et al., 2008). The distribution of Sec16, Sar1, and the COPII coat proteins drastically differs from that of the Sar1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12, which has been found distributed largely at the ER (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997; daSilva et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005). Similar to other eukaryotic cells, transport of proteins in plant cells may occur by bulk flow, as demonstrated for soluble proteins (Crofts et al., 1999; Phillipson et al., 2001), as well as in dependence of signals that can be present in the transmembrane domain (Brandizzi et al., 2002a; Schoberer et al., 2014), or through the presence of specific motifs that are recognized by COPII proteins.

Images from time-lapse sequence acquired at the cortical region of tobacco leaf epidermal cell with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. The Sec16 marker distributes at the peri-Golgi area (arrowheads) as well as to structures of unknown identity that are not associated with the Golgi marker (arrows; Takagi et al., 2013). The structures labeled by Sec16 can assume a ring-like shape (Takagi et al., 2013). Time of frames in the sequence is indicated at the left-hand corner of images (seconds). *, A chloroplast that is visible through chlorophyll autofluorescence. Bars = 5 and 1 μm (inset).As it would be expected for specialized ER export domains in which cargo is packaged for export and release to the Golgi, ERESs are dynamic entities. Photobleaching experiments on fluorescent protein fusions to Sec13 and Sec24 have shown a high degree of turnover of these proteins on and off ERESs. Functional analyses on the effect of Sec16A loss-of-function mutation on COPII assembly in live cells have also demonstrated that Sec16A is involved in the dynamic association of coat components onto the ER, because in its absence, Sec24 and Sec13 were found to cycle on and off the ERESs to a much faster rate than in wild-type cells (Takagi et al., 2013). These findings support the possibility that Sec16 has a regulatory role on the COPII coat assembly, likely by influencing the GTPase activity of Sar1, which recruits the outer COPII coat components (Takagi et al., 2013). Increase in ERES size and number was verified when ER export competent membrane cargo was expressed transiently in tobacco leaf epidermal cells compared with ER export incompetent membrane cargo and bulk flow cargo (Hanton et al., 2008), supporting that the establishment and maintenance of ERESs are responsive to the cell’s necessity to export membrane and cargo from the ER. It will be interesting to test in the future whether modulation of ERES number and size depends on Sec16 and its functional interactions with COPII proteins. A striking feature of the ERESs is their movement. The subcellular distribution of ERESs with respect to Golgi stacks has been debated for quite some time (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013). Although a transient association of the COPII machinery with the Golgi apparatus is plausible if partially coated COPII carriers are linked with the Golgi membrane before the COPII coat is completely shed (Langhans et al., 2012), a recent study on the subcellular localization and function of a plant Sec16 homolog has revealed new insights that further support an association of ERESs and motile Golgi (daSilva et al., 2004; Takagi et al., 2013). In particular, through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analyses using a functional fluorescent protein to Sec16A, Sec16A was found to undergo dynamic binding and release from the membranes to slower rates compared with those of the outer COPII coat components such as Sec13, which was found to interact with Sec16 together with Sec31, and Sec24 (Takagi et al., 2013). If the punctate distribution of fluorescent protein fusion to COPII components observed in live-cell imaging studies were the result of association of these proteins with Golgi membranes, then Sec16 should show dynamics on and off membranes similar to the outer COPII components. However, the evidence that Sec16 cycles on and off the membranes at a slower rate compared with Sec24 and Sec13 and that the pool of membrane-associated protein significantly differs between Sec16 and Sec13 or Sec24 (Takagi et al., 2013) supports that a subpopulation of Sec16 is excluded from the coat of formed COPII carriers and labels ERESs that face the Golgi apparatus. The discrete steady-state localization of Sec16A at ERESs that are associated with the Golgi stacks supports that the plant ER/Golgi interface is uniquely organized such that ERESs move together with associated Golgi stacks. In this model, known as the secretory-units model (daSilva et al., 2004), ERESs would facilitate ER export to the Golgi at a Golgi-facing surface that is relatively static. Such organization does not exclude the possibility that non-Golgi-associated ERESs may also exist. In this light, it is possible that the ERES/Golgi unit may encounter ERESs that are not associated with a Golgi stack and eventually associate with it. It is similarly possible that non-Golgi-associated ERESs may assemble to form new Golgi stacks. The association of ERESs with the Golgi could also favor efficient retrograde transport mediated by cargo carriers such as COPI vesicles that have been clearly visualized in plant cells (Pimpl et al., 2000; Donohoe et al., 2007). ADP-ribosylation factor1, the GTPase involved in COPI coat assembly and dissociation, as well as coatomer, has been localized at the plant Golgi (Stefano et al., 2006; Matheson et al., 2007). It is possible to hypothesize that COPI vesicles might fuse proximally to COPII-enriched ERESs. Retrograde transport of membrane from the Golgi at the ER-Golgi interface close to the ERES region could facilitate fast retrieval and concentration of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and other components of the machinery necessary for anterograde transport from the ER towards the Golgi. The close spatial relationship between Golgi and ER and the evidence for a continuous exchange of Golgi enzymes with the ER (Brandizzi et al., 2002b) raise the question on whether the close association of ERESs with Golgi could have a role in holding the ER and the Golgi in close association. Such organization would facilitate ER protein export to a motile organelle. That the plant ER and the Golgi are attached has been demonstrated through the application of optical laser tweezers through which induced movement of tweezer-pulled Golgi stacks caused movement of the ER (Sparkes et al., 2009a). It is possible that ERESs and Golgi may be tethered by a proteinaceous mesh, which could not only facilitate the ER-Golgi directionality of COPII carriers, but also hold the two organelles together. It may also be that ERESs have a more direct role in the ER-Golgi interaction. It is also possible that the transient state between formation and dissipation of COPII carriers could enable the formation of a dynamic bridge that is sufficient to hold the Golgi in place on ERESs. Similar to the Golgi biogenesis model proposed earlier (Donohoe et al., 2013), the dynamic attachment of the ER and the Golgi would be facilitated during cisternae biogenesis whereby the most ER-proximal cisterna of the Golgi would be produced de novo by partial or complete fusion of COPII carriers and then mature into a distal cisterna via retrograde recycling of membranes and proteins.CHRIS HAWES: LET IT BE TUBES What Can EM Tell Us? Back in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the discovery of COPI and COII vesicles, various electron microscope (EM) studies of the plant endomembrane system suggested that there may be direct membrane connections between the ER and Golgi bodies, which were often termed dicytosomes in those days (Mollenhauer at al., 1976; Harris, 1979). To enable selective enhancement of the membranes of these organelles and to permit studies in three dimensions using thick sections and high-voltage electron microscopy, osmium impregnation techniques combined with either zinc iodide or potassium ferricyanide, to enhance the deposition of osmium on membranes and within the lumen of EM tubules and ER/Golgi cisternae, were often applied (Harris, 1979; Hepler, 1981). This resulted in a number of reports suggesting that the ER was directly connected to Golgi bodies via membrane-bounded tubules and that Golgi bodies themselves presented many tubules at the margins of their cisternae. In our laboratory, we undertook a limited survey of ER-Golgi interactions in a number of tissues using the zinc iodide osmium impregnation technique (Juniper et al., 1982) and concluded that in maize (Zea mays) root caps, bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) root tips, and leaves (probably erroneously), the ER and Golgi were not connected. However, in the heavily protein-secreting glands of the Venus flytrap (Dionea muscipula), after stimulation of secretion, we observed numerous tubular extensions from cisternal rims, including cis-cisternae, that appeared to interconnect with the ER. At the same time, a study of the Golgi apparatus in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm (Parker and Hawes, 1982), using high-voltage electron microscopy of thick sections of osmium-impregnated tissue, reported fine peripheral cisternal tubules connecting the cis-Golgi as well as other cisternae to the ER. This was also reported in developing bean and mung bean (Vigna radiata) seeds (Harris, 1979; Harris and Oparka, 1983). In wheat, these fine tubules were often much thinner than an ER tubule and, unless heavily osmium impregnated, under normal contrasting conditions in the EM, would unlikely scatter sufficient electrons to be readily visible. More recently, we reported ER-Golgi connections in tobacco leaves using osmium impregnation (Brandizzi et al., 2002b). Of course, the presence of tubules in electron micrographs does not prove they are involved in transport, retrograde, or anterograde but does show perhaps a more intimate relationship between the two organelles than is often assumed. Likewise, it has been shown that the ER surface itself is highly motile (Runions et al., 2006). Therefore, conceptually, there should be no problem in envisaging membrane flow from the ER through to the Golgi. In contrast to these results, there are relatively few reports of vesicles budding from the ER or existing at the interface between the ER and Golgi, although Schnepf and Christ (1980) suggested that a vesicle flow exits in the epithelial cells of the nectaries of Asclepias curassavica. Only in a few publications using ultra-rapid high-pressure freeze fixation followed by freeze substitution and electron tomography have COPII vesicles been shown budding from the ER (Kang and Staehelin, 2008; Hawes, 2012; Donohoe et al., 2013), mainly in root meristem cells. An example in developing Arabidopsis endosperm tissue can be seen in Figure 1, C to G, of this article. Unfortunately, three-dimensional analysis and reconstruction by electron tomography of data such as these still relies on manual tracing of images, as autosegmentation algorithms cannot as yet differentiate the subtle differences in contrast in such electron micrographs to permit totally unbiased autosegmented reconstructions. However, it is possible to observe tubular connections between ER and cis-Golgi in tomograms of osmium-impregnated root material (C. Hawes, unpublished data; Fig. 3A). At this stage, it should be noted that lack of COPII vesicles is not restricted to plants but has been reported in several microorganisms. Likewise, depletion of COPII components does not always inhibit cargo transport from the ER in yeasts and animals (for references, see Mironov, 2014). Figure 3. Open in a new tab A, Maximum-intensity projection in negative contrast of a stack of thin sections from a tomogram of a pea (Pisum sativum) root tip Golgi body and associated ER impregnated by the osmium zinc iodide technique. The reconstruction is presented at an angle to show a clear tubular connection between the ER and cis-Golgi. B, Inside face view of a dry-cleaved carrot (Daucus carota) suspension culture cell. The cell had been fixed on a coated EM grid, dehydrated, and critical point dried prior to dry cleaving on double-sided tape. The view onto the plasma membrane shows dark mitochondria (M), complete Golgi stacks in face view (G), cisternal ER (CER), and tubular ER (arrows). Note the huge difference between the diameter of a Golgi body and ER tubules.An argument has been made on the lack of COPII EM images based around the calculation that, in reality, there are very few COPII vesicles at any one time in the ER-Golgi interface and that, in any one thin section, at most, only one vesicle would be seen (Langhans et al., 2012). This argument of course only holds true if such vesicles do exist. If they don’t, then they obviously would not be seen. Likewise, if tubules are transient in nature, they would rarely be seen in conventional electron micrographs and, when caught in cross section, would appear to be vesicular! An obvious experiment where COPII vesicles should be seen is in the reformation of Golgi after brefeldin A (BFA)-induced reabsorption into the ER. One such study on tobacco Bright Yellow2 (BY2) cells reported buds on the ER surfaces, which were infrequent, and tubular vesicular clusters, representing the earliest observable stage of stack regeneration cells (Langhans et al., 2007). These clusters immunolabeled for COPI coat components but not for COPII proteins. Considering the number of Golgi stacks in such cells, which is in the hundreds, if COPII vesicles exist, then it is surprising that none were seen in these experiments. Of course, the get-out-of-jail card and perhaps a lazy answer to all of these discrepancies in the ultrastructural literature is simply to state that data from chemically fixed material is artifactual in nature due to slow fixation rates and only data from ultra-rapidly frozen freeze-substituted material is acceptable. This of course ignores the fact that, in chemically fixed material, it is easy to visualize both COPI and clathrin coats. So, why not COPII coats, especially as they are relatively easy to visualize in chemically fixed cells of algae such as C. noctigama (Hummel et al., 2007)? Two other golden rules of thin-section transmission electron microscopy also have to be remembered: (1) A thin section presents a two-dimensional image, and thus a tubule in cross section can easily be misinterpreted as a vesicle; and (2) Any biological material has to scatter sufficient electrons to form an image. Thus, a membrane in transverse section, spanning 70 nm of resin, scatters sufficient electrons to form a classic unit-membrane image, whereas the same stained membrane in face view may not present sufficient heavy-metal stain molecules and thus be electron lucent and not form an image; thus, fine tubules and membranes in face view can be missed. Selective-membrane staining techniques overcome this latter limitation. Of course, other EM techniques exist such as freeze-fracture or freeze-fracture deep etch, which should reveal structured exit sites on ER and COPII coats, but as far as I am aware, apart from the occasional image showing clathrin-coated vesicles and COPI vesicles (Coleman et al., 1987; Andreeva et al., 1998, no such images of COPII structures have been published in plants.Has Live-Cell Imaging Helped? Our initial observations on Golgi and ER in living leaf epidermal cells let us observe, for the first time, the dynamic nature of the organelles and the fact that Golgi bodies in leaves appeared to move over the surface of the ER (Boevink et al., 1998). This led us to propose the hoover model of Golgi bodies traveling over the ER surface sucking up vesicles produced by the ER, thus making the serious, but all too common, mistake of assuming that the plant ER-Golgi interface would function exactly the same as the mammalian ER in the production of COPII vesicles. However, over the past decade or so, we have refined our ideas and developed the secretory unit concept of ERESs and Golgi bodies traveling as single units around the cell with the motile surface of the ER (daSilva et al., 2004; Langhans et al., 2012). Such advances were made possible by the revolution in live-cell imaging offered by fluorescent protein technology and direct organelle labeling combined with techniques such as photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescent probes. This enabled a range of experiments to be undertaken on the ER-Golgi interface, and contrary to what is often stated, it was shown there is no real evidence that transport between the ER and individual Golgi bodies only takes places when stacks are stationary (the stop-and-go model; Brandizzi et al., 2002b). We demonstrated that in a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiment, recovery of fluorescence of a Golgi membrane protein could be demonstrated in moving Golgi, indicating a continual transfer of protein from ER to Golgi (daSilva et al., 2004). Subsequently, laser manipulation of Golgi has demonstrated that when captured and translated through the cytoplasm by an infrared laser beam, Golgi bodies almost always drag a tubule of ER behind them (Sparkes et al., 2009c). One of the conclusions from this work was that the ER and Golgi are closely associated and tethered together, not via the cytoskeleton, but most likely by a number of structural proteins such as the Golgins/Golgi matrix proteins (Hawes et al., 2008). In studies of Golgi destruction and reformation in tobacco leaf cells, we showed that with either a genetic block of secretion or inhibition by BFA, reabsorption of the Golgi back into the ER was an ordered process, starting with the release of translocated Golgins into the cytoplasm followed by sequential reabsorption of trans-, medial, and cis-membranes into the ER. However, a cis-located matrix component, CASP, remained associated with ERESs, and we suggest that this protein may be part of the tethering complex holding the Golgi to the ER (Osterrieder et al., 2010; Schoberer et al., 2010). How this ordered membrane transport back to the ER is mediated is not known; perhaps some of the cisternal associated Golgi-ER tubules are involved in this pathway. Interestingly, Golgi bodies in vacuolated tissue such as leaf epidermal cells are only ever associated with curved membranes of the ER such as tubules or more rarely the edges of cisternae (Sparkes et al., 2009b) and are never seen on the flat faces of ER cisternae. This situation has also been reported for yeast, where ERESs were associated with high-curvature domains containing the membrane-curving ER protein reticulon1 (Okamoto et al., 2012), and we have preliminary evidence that in Arabidopsis, reticulons may interact with SEC12, the Sar1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recruits the GTPase to the ER membrane as part of the COPII coat-building process (Kriechbaumer and Hawes, unpublished data). Thus, we can conclude that plant ERESprobably requires a curved ER surface on which to form. Due to the nature of fluorescence and the diffraction limit of the microscopies used, an artificial impression is given in typical confocal micrographs of the diameter of ER tubules, compared with the diameter of a Golgi body (around 1 µm), giving a ratio of approximately 1:2. However, when observed by EM techniques such as dry cleave to show the cortical ER, whose tubes are in reality are around 30 to 90 nm, and associated Golgi, it is obvious that this ratio is more like 1:8, even taking into account the fact that cis-Golgi cisternae tend to be smaller in diameter than the rest of the stack (Fig. 3B). Thus, ERESs have to form on a relatively restricted area of highly curved membrane and not a flat surface, and perhaps the requirement for membrane bending proteins to produce a bud is lessened. Also, an ERES would need to be linear in structure along roughly 200 nm of ER tubule. Could such a structure produce sufficient 70-nm vesicles to transfer the required protein and membrane to a Golgi body? Such calculations have not yet been made. Of course, it is generally accepted that COPII components are required in plants for some, if not all, transport between the ER and Golgi. As described above, it is easily demonstrated that inhibition of the formation of a COPII coat by expressing a nonhydrolysable form of the coat-initiating GTPase SAR1p results in the disruption of Golgi stack homeostasis and resorption of Golgi membrane back into the ER (Osterrieder et al., 2010). However, coating of a membrane patch to promote curvature and concentrate cargo at the tip of a transiently produced tubule is a distinct possibility. It has been shown in vitro that COPII components can tubulate liposome membrane (Bacia et al., 2011), and it has even been suggested that COPII coat components have sufficient flexibility to form 300-nm tubular structures that can accommodate large filamentous cargo such as procollagen fibrils (Miller and Schekman, 2013). Such tubes could easily span the narrow greater-than-300-nm interface between ER and cis-Golgi in plants.DAVID G. ROBINSON: THE ODDS ARE STACKED IN FAVOR OF VESICLES The Mobile Secretory Unit: What Are the Consequences for Bidirectional ER-Golgi Traffic? In the frequently used leaf epidermal system, it is well established that COPII-fluorescence labeling always colocalizes with fluorescent Golgi markers, whether the Golgi stacks are mobile or not (daSilva et al., 2004; Hanton et al., 2009). For most researchers, punctate fluorescent COPII signals on the surface of the ER are synonymous with ERESs, but this may not necessarily be so because the visualization of COPII binding does not actually reveal the actual exit event. Langhans et al. (2012) have also questioned the fidelity of COPII-fluorescence labeling in recording ERESs on the surface of the ER and have suggested instead that the signals may instead represent prefusion COPII vesicles lying in the interface between ERESs and the cis-Golgi. Despite these caveats, it seems that anterograde traffic from the ER is restricted to a domain of the ER immediately adjacent to a Golgi stack and is embodied in the concept of the secretory unit (daSilva et al., 2004; Hanton et al., 2009). It now appears that retrograde traffic between the Golgi and the ER is also spatially restricted, because it has been demonstrated that the SNAREs on target membrane (t-SNAREs) required for COPI vesicle fusion with the ER localize to ER domains immediately underneath Golgi stacks (Lerich et al. 2012). This unique feature of the secretory pathway in plants probably serves the purpose of control and regulation, because the problem of stochastic release of COPII vesicles into the cytosol and their subsequent capture by Golgi stacks is avoided. The concept of the secretory unit received great support from laser-trapping technology, which demonstrated that ER tubules moved with individual Golgi stacks when the latter were displaced (Sparkes et al., 2009a). This key observation could be interpreted as proof of direct membrane continuities between the ER and the cis-Golgi, but in the opinion of the majority, it is a consequence of the existence of tethering/matrix proteins that not only anchor the Golgi stack to the ER surface (Latijnhouwers et al., 2005; Osterrieder, 2012), but also maintain the integrity of the Golgi stack (Ito et al., 2014). An important feature of these experiments is that the Golgi stacks were immobilized by actin inhibitors, obviously a prerequisite for capturing otherwise mobile Golgi stacks. In this situation, interlocking matrix protein interactions between the ER and the Golgi are probably comparable to the real-life situation of a stop period in Golgi travel. However, it remains unclear as to whether the actual exit of anterograde cargo from the ER (i.e. vesicle budding [or COPII tube formation]) is restricted to the stationary phase or occurs continuously during Golgi movement. We also do not know whether antero- and retrograde transport are separate or coordinated, synchronized events. Lerich et al. (2012) have suggested that prefusion clusters of COPII and COPI vesicles might accompany mobile Golgi stacks, but the colocalization of Golgi stacks with the SNARE of the Qc-type syntaxin of plants72 (SYP72) of the t-SNARE fusion complex only in the immobilized condition suggests that entry of COPI retrograde cargo into the ER is restricted to stationary Golgi stacks.Why Are COPII Vesicles Difficult to Visualize in Higher Plants? COPI vesicles have been detected at the periphery of Golgi cisternae in higher plants (Pimpl et al., 2000; Donohoe et al., 2007). Although their positive identification as retrograde carriers to the ER in plants awaits confirmation, it is very likely that they do fulfill this function. This being so, there seems to be no a priori reason for questioning the participation of COPII vesicles in anterograde ER-Golgi traffic, yet their visualization in higher plant cells has proved difficult. In mammalian cells, there is a transport intermediate between the ER and the perinuclear immobile Golgi complex known as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC; Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006). It is this structure rather than the Golgi apparatus that is engaged in bidirectional COPII/COPI-mediated trafficking. During its formation (apparently through homotypic COPII vesicle fusion) and before it begins moving in the direction of the Golgi complex, it lies close to the surface of the ER (200–500 nm distant) in the immediate vicinity of ER export sites. Nevertheless, free COPII-coated carriers/vesicles have been reported on several occasions in the ER/ERGIC interface (Zeuschner et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2009; Witte et al., 2011). In support of these observations, it has been recently demonstrated that loss of function of a cytosolic protein complex (transmembrane tyrosine receptor kinase-fused gene), which forms aggregates that temporarily trap COPII carriers in the ER/ERGIC interface, causes free COPII carriers to accumulate throughout the cytoplasm (Johnson et al., 2015). A similarly narrow interface exists between ER and the cis-Golgi (the probable ERGIC equivalent in plants), so why the problem in seeing COPII vesicles in thin sections of higher plant cells? Langhans et al. (2012) have attributed this to the relatively small numbers of transport vesicles (at the very most 20) in the interface at any one time, which extrapolates to only a single vesicle in a thin section. There may be other contributing factors, for example, the speed of vesicle transport and, obviously if bidirectional transport is restricted to the stationary phase of Golgi movement, the timing of transport. If so, the chances of visualizing transport vesicles in the ER-Golgi interface will be seriously affected by the mobile status of the Golgi stack at the moment of fixation.Have Gap-Spanning Tubules Been Observed in the Interface between the ER and cis-Golgi? This can be answered with a categorical no, despite opposing claims made in some recent reviews (Sparkes et al., 2009a; Stefano et al., 2014). A careful scrutiny of the electron micrographs in the papers cited in these reviews (for details, see “Chris Hawes: Let It Be Tubes”) in support of direct membrane continuity at the ER/Golgi interface reveals that the connections are not at the interface but are, in fact, lateral connections between undefined but probably median Golgi cisternae and the ER. Moreover, the frequency of such continuities is enhanced under nonphysiological conditions, e.g. cold (Mollenhauer at al., 1976) or BFA (Ritzenthaler et al., 2002) treatments. The physiological significance of such lateral connections remains obscure, especially because it is not in harmony with the glycoprotein processing reactions that are supposed to occur in a sequential manner through the Golgi stack (from cis to trans). Also, lateral connections of this type are difficult to reconcile with Golgi stacks gliding over the surface of the ER. Finally, if tubular connections between the ER/nuclear envelope and the cis-face of a Golgi stack do exist, one would expect that the chances of visualizing them would be greater in those cases where the Golgi is immobile. However, such structures have never been seen in algal cells with naturally stationary Golgi stacks nor in higher plant cells where the Golgi has been immobilized through actin inhibitors.What Are the Advantages of Vesicles? Vesicles allow organelles to communicate among themselves and with the cell exterior (via the plasma membrane). With such transport vectors, cargo molecules can be transferred between organelles without disturbing their integrity. By excluding certain molecules and including others, vesicles also allow for a high degree of selectivity in intracellular transport. The efficient sorting of proteins into vesicles is to a great extent related to coat proteins at their surface that interact with several different types of integral transmembrane proteins: cargo receptors, helper proteins, such as the p24 proteins, and SNAREs. All of the coat proteins (COPI, COPII, and clathrin) can polymerize to form spherical structures (cages) and thus have the inherent ability to form vesicles, although it is true that COPII does it differently to COPI and clathrin (Hughson, 2010). However, the special properties of the COPII coat allow the incorporation of cargos of different sizes, something that cannot be achieved with clathrin or COPI vesicles. Therefore, COPII vesicles of different sizes can accommodate export of different cargo from the ER (Miller and Schekman, 2013) without the need for direct tubular connections. Finally, by concentrating SNAREs into a small amount of membrane, the efficiency of vesicle fusion with a specific target compartment is increased. The inhibition of vesicle formation can lead to uncontrolled fusion of organelles mediated by SNAREs on vesicle membrane and t-SNAREs as seen for the Golgi-ER hybrid structures formed in the presence of BFA (Elazar et al., 1994; Ritzenthaler et al., 2002). By contrast, tubular contacts (irrespective of their longevity), or direct contacts between organelles culminating in fusion and then fission (as, for example, in hug-and-kiss models; Kurokawa et al., 2014), have the inherent caveat that an unspecific mixing of organelle contents may occur. Another problem is that if there is direct contact between the lumina of two adjacent compartments, how can pH differences be maintained? This is particularly important in the case of the endoplasmic reticulum protein retention (ERD2) receptor recognizing the tetrapeptide motif lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) receptor, which, in mammalian cells, is thought to bind to its KDEL-ligands at an acid pH (pH 6.7) in the cis-Golgi and to release them at the higher pH (pH 7.2) of the ER lumen (Wilson et al., 1993; Majoul et al., 1998; Paroutis et al., 2004). As is the case with the mannosyl-6 P receptor in mammalian endosomes, apparently only a relatively small shift in pH is sufficient to cause ligand release. A similar pH gradient of about 0.5 pH units between the ER and the Golgi also exists in plants (Martiniére et al., 2013), and it has recently been shown that the binding of COPII proteins to a plant ERD2 homolog is favored at neutral pH conditions, whereas the recruitment of COPI proteins to ERD2 is more optimal at an acidic pH (Montezinos et al., 2014). Bidirectional protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi apparatus also entails the movement of membrane. In the anterograde direction, this serves the purpose of replenishing membrane lost at the trans-face of the Golgi stack through release of the trans-Golgi network (Viotti et al., 2010) and continually drives the process termed cisternal maturation. In the retrograde direction, it is a consequence of receptor recycling. While vesicles clearly fulfill this requirement, it is less easy to see how tubes can achieve it. If ERES and cis-Golgi cisternae briefly touch each other, fuse, and rapidly separate, there can be no net movement of membrane at all. This is a stringent interpretation of the hug-and-kiss model of Kurokawa et al. (2014). However, if there is an active uptake of membrane (a patch of previously COPII-coated ERESs) together with soluble cargo as the cis-Golgi docks onto ERES, the model should perhaps be renamed hug and bite. As new data becomes available, researchers are often compelled to revise their standpoints on particular issues. My initial interpretation of ER-Golgi traffic, based on immunofluorescent studies in tobacco BY2 cells (Yang et al., 2005), led me to believe that ERESs were greatly in excess of Golgi stacks. Switching to leaf epidermal cells and perhaps more stringent localization criteria via transient expression of X-fluorescent protein tagged, convinced me of the validity of the secretory unit concept. Nevertheless, I was never in doubt about vesicles, and I maintain that the unique features of the secretory unit, i.e. mobile Golgi stacks with a narrow interface to the ER, are not necessarily an impediment to COP vesicles as mediators for bidirectional protein traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in higher plants. By contrast, direct membrane continuities between the ER and the Golgi have physiological drawbacks, and there is no convincing evidence for their existence, even in organisms where Golgi stacks remain permanently stationary.AKIHIKO NAKANO: A COMMON MECHANISM FOR ER-TO-GOLGI TRAFFIC: A VIEW FROM SUPERRESOLUTION LIVE-IMAGING MICROSCOPY How proteins traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus is an interesting and controversial issue. Problems have arisen in part through limitations of time and space resolution in observing the two organelles. My opinions section will focus on how we have tackled this problem by superresolution live imaging. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been used as an ideal model system to study molecular mechanisms of membrane trafficking, because it is amenable to both genetics and biochemistry. In addition, its simplicity in organellar organization offers advantages in live imaging. We have applied high-speed confocal microscopy (Nakano, 2002) to S. cerevisiae and have made many discoveries that would have never been possible without live imaging at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, I will describe first what we learned from S. cerevisiae and then move on to compare similarly obtained data from plant and animal cells. Golgi cisternae do not stack in S. cerevisiae (Glick and Nakano, 2009; Suda and Nakano, 2012), but not all budding yeasts have this feature. P. pastoris has, for example, stacked Golgi. This peculiar property of S. cerevisiae provides a wonderful opportunity to observe individual Golgi cisternae in living cells. Our and Ben Glick’s groups demonstrated that the yeast Golgi cisternae change properties from cis to medial and then to trans over time (Losev et al., 2006; Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006). This gave strong support for the cisternal maturation model of intra-Golgi protein transport (Glick and Nakano, 2009; Nakano and Luini, 2010). During the course of our studies on S. cerevisiae, we found that the microscopic method we were using (combination of a high-speed spinning-disc confocal scanner and a high-sensitivity camera system) had a great potential in improving resolution not only in time, but also in space (Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006). I will skip the details here, but briefly, accurate image acquisition and minute data processing by deconvolution allow for amazing superresolution beyond the diffraction limit (Kurokawa et al., 2013). We have achieved 50- to 60-nm resolution in three-dimensional space with the time resolution of a few seconds per volume (the spec is further rising now). This method has been given the acronym SCLIM, standing for superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy (Kurokawa et al., 2013). With such a high spatiotemporal resolution, we next tried to understand how cis-Golgi cisternae form. According to a classic cisternal maturation model, newly formed COPII vesicles containing cargo fuse with each other, and cis-Golgi proteins would join via COPI vesicles. First, we observed that the fluorescence of COPII coats, indicators of ERESs, shows a very dynamic behavior. The ERESs enlarge and shrink and are often very mobile. They appear to be stabilized when approaching high-curvature ER domains, such as the saddle-shaped surface of the ER sheet edge and along the ER tubules (Fig. 4). On the Golgi side, cis-cisternae show a significantly high probability of staying in the vicinity of the ERESs, whereas trans-cisternae do not (Okamoto et al., 2012). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Organization of the ERESs in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Left, Dual-color three-dimensional image of Sec13-GFP (ERES marker, green) and monomeric red fluorescent protein-Sec12 (bulk ER marker, red) obtained by SCLIM. Right, Two-dimensional slice image taken from the three-dimensional data. ERESs localize at the high-curvature domains of the ER, such as along tubules and at the edge of the sheet. Bar = 1 μm.A more detailed analysis of their behavior unveiled that the cis-Golgi frequently approaches the ERESs, keeps contact for a few seconds, and then leaves there. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of COPII often goes down upon this contact, suggesting an uncoating event during this process. The trans-Golgi cisternae also approach the ERESs but do not share the same tendency for a collapse of the COPII coat (Kurokawa et al., 2014). We reasoned that what we later termed the hug-and-kiss behavior of the cis-Golgi toward the ERESs indicates the capture of newly forming COPII vesicles followed by their uncoating and subsequent fusion with the cis-Golgi. To confirm this, we set up a system to pulse chase the cargo by live imaging. Fluorescent cargo that is synthesized and accumulated in the ER at a high temperature (39°C) proceeds to the secretory process upon shift down to a low temperature (25°C). Cargo first relocates to the ERESs and then gradually moves to the Golgi apparatus. When cis-Golgi approaches the ER, the cargo signal overlaps with the cis-Golgi signal, and then the cis-Golgi leaves the ER together with the cargo (Kurokawa et al., 2014). Thus, we conclude that cargo is delivered from the ERESs to the cis-Golgi through such a hug-and-kiss event. This seems to be a safer and more efficient way to send cargo to the destination than by releasing free COPII vesicles into the cytosol. It also explains why it has been so difficult to observe COPII vesicles by electron microscopy. Now, this hug-and-kiss delivery of cargo from the ER to the Golgi raises many new questions. (1) Do the COPII signals seen in our experiments represent clusters of COPII vesicles or patches of COPII coat? We do not know at the moment. Their sizes and shapes vary dynamically, suggesting that they do not correspond to individual single COPII buds. Considering the flexible nature of the COPII coat (Miller and Schekman, 2013), they could be either clusters of COPII buds or large patches of COPII coat, as has been proposed for clathrin coats. (2) Is the COPII vesicle formation completed before or during the hug and kiss? In other words, when does the fission of COPII vesicles occur? This is a good question. As the sorting of cargo from ER resident proteins must occur during the budding event, discontinuity would be desired. But as has been discussed for the presence of tubular connections in the Golgi stacks (Glick and Nakano, 2009; Nakano and Luini, 2010), a physical discontinuity of membrane may not be necessarily required for sorting of proteins. (3) If the hug-and-kiss mechanism ensures efficient and safe transfer of cargo, why are COPII vesicles necessary? We are not proposing that COPII vesicles are not released at all. At least, in certain in vitro or cell-free reconstructed systems, COPII vesicles do form in a Sar1 GTPase-dependent manner (Oka and Nakano, 1994; Barlowe et al., 1994; Matsuoka et al., 1998; Sato and Nakano, 2004; Tabata et al., 2009). In sec17 (soluble NSF attachment protein) and sec18 (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) mutants, which are defective in vesicle fusion, numerous vesicles including COPII vesicles accumulate in the cytosol (Novick et al., 1980). However, releasing free vesicles in a large amount would be wasteful and even dangerous. Under normal conditions, we believe that complete release of COPII vesicles is maintained to a minimum. (4) If the cis-Golgi acts as a preexisting compartment to capture cargo from the ER, is there a stable pool? How does this model reconcile with the cisternal maturation from cis to trans? In our previous work (Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006), we stated that the cis-Golgi appears to form de novo. However, with improved resolution, it looks more likely that small structures containing a cis-Golgi marker move around and grow over time before entering the maturation phase. We usually use Suppressor of Erd2 Deletion (Sed5; the counterpart of SYP31/SYP32 of plants and syntaxin5 of mammals) as a cis-Golgi marker, but considering the findings we have made in tobacco BY2 cells (Ito et al., 2012), the yeast Sed5 compartment may represent both a sorting platform like the ERGIC as well as the first enzymatic station of the glycosylation factory (see also below). (5) Is a hug-and-kiss mechanism specific to yeast? This is also a frequently asked question. We believe that the answer is no. In the remaining part of my essay, I would like to proceed to a comparison between yeast and other eukaryotes. Plant cells have beautiful stacks of the Golgi apparatus, which are largely associated with the ER. To try to address how Golgi stacks are assembled and maintained in tobacco BY2 cells, we set up a system for live imaging in which Golgi stacks are disassembled by BFA treatment and reformed after BFA removal (Ito et al., 2012). While most of Golgi markers were absorbed into the ER upon BFA treatment as previously reported (Takeuchi et al., 2000, 2002; Ritzenthaler et al., 2002), we realized that some of the cis-Golgi markers (SYP31 and Retrieval Protein Endoplasmic Reticulum 1B) remained in the cytosol as small punctate structures. Another cis-Golgi marker, ERD2, diffuses into the ER together with medial and trans-markers, suggesting that there are two different classes of cis-Golgi proteins. Upon BFA wash, the small punctate structures of SYP31 nucleate to build new cisternae, to which other Golgi proteins then join in a cis-to-trans sequence. The small punctate structures of SYP31 are in the close vicinity of the ERESs but do not completely overlap with them (Ito et al., 2012). All of these observations suggest that the SYP31 compartment represents a scaffold to build the Golgi stack around, like the ERGIC of mammalian cells. The other type of cis-Golgi, in which ERD2 resides, may be a little distal to the SYP31 compartment. Simultaneous imaging of SYP31 and ERD2 shows their slightly different localizations in the stack (Y. Ito, unpublished data). Distinction of the cis-most cisterna of the Golgi from the later compartments in terms of function has also been reported by electron tomography. The cis-most cisterna is proposed to function as a protein-sorting platform, whereas the later compartments are involved in the biosynthetic activities of the Golgi (Donohoe et al., 2013). Regarding the relationship with the ERESs, it should also be mentioned that, in our study of BY2 cells, the number of ERESs is larger than that of cis-Golgi cisternae (Fig. 5). The ERESs without associated Golgi stacks are extremely mobile and may become stable when they encounter the Golgi (Ito et al., 2012). Figure 5. Open in a new tab The cis-Golgi cisternae (monomeric red fluorescent protein-SYP31, magenta) and ERESs (SEC13-yellow fluorescent protein, green) visualized in tobacco BY2 cells. Confocal images were captured by SCLIM and reconstructed into three dimensions with deconvolution. A typical trajectory image from a three-dimensional time-lapse movie is shown. Almost all of the Golgi stacks were associated with bright spots of ERESs. From the magnified image (inset), we could observe the ERESs surrounding the cis-Golgi making ring-shaped fluorescent patterns. Bars = 5 and 1 μm (inset).Consideration of the role the ERGIC plays for a subset of cis-Golgi compartments leads to the notion that it may be a very general feature of ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Ito et al., 2014; Kurokawa et al., 2014). It is widely accepted that the ERGIC is a typical structure of vertebrate cells, which have radial organization of microtubules, and receives cargo from the ERESs in the cell periphery before transporting it to the Golgi ribbon in the centrosomal region. Other organisms that do not have such astral patterns of microtubules, e.g. invertebrates, plants, and fungi, are believed to lack the ERGIC. However, as discussed above, plant cells appear to have a structure functionally related to the ERGIC. Drosophila melanogaster cells, which have dispersed Golgi, have also been reported to have an ERGIC-like structure (Witte et al., 2011). Furthermore, even in the yeast S. cerevisiae, we now propose that the mobile Sed5 structures that show a hug-and-kiss action toward ERESs may be regarded as ERGIC-like (Kurokawa et al., 2014). The ERGIC of mammalian cells is closely associated with the ERESs (Budnik and Stephens, 2009) and so is the D. melanogaster ERGIC (Witte et al., 2011). A SCLIM image of ERESs and cis-Golgi in a BY2 cell is presented in Figure 5. Altogether, the currently available data envisage a common mechanism of cargo delivery in the spatially close relationship of ERESs and the ERGIC (or its counterpart). Such an association of ERESs and the ERGIC is relatively stable in the cases of mammals, D. melanogaster, plants, and the yeast P. pastoris but is transient in S. cerevisiae. Interaction of these two compartments must require special molecular machinery, and we have proposed a role for the tethering factor Vesicle Transport (YusoU is transport in Japanese) factor; yeast counterpart of p115) in the association of ERESs and the cis-Golgi. Interestingly, when the Uso1 function is compromised by a temperature-sensitive mutation, the action of cis-Golgi is frozen during the hug-and-kiss event (Kurokawa et al., 2014). There are still many problems remaining. Obviously, the observation of COPII vesicles in the spatiotemporal resolution good enough to distinguish individual dynamics has urgent priority for us. There is biochemical evidence that cargoes are selected during COPII vesicle budding (Sato and Nakano, 2005) and ER-Golgi shuttling proteins are retrieved back from the Golgi to the ER via COPI vesicles (Cosson et al., 1998; Sato et al., 2001). These events also await a revisit by live imaging. We are now in the process of developing the second-generation SCLIM, which will provide us with far-better images of what is going on in the narrow interface between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.CONCLUSION After having gone through the information and arguments presented above, it will not come as a surprise to the reader that the authors found themselves unable to reach a consensus about the modality of membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in higher plants. While there is no question that COPII proteins are essential for this process, doubt continues as to whether vesicles are the vectors of bidirectional traffic between the two organelles. It is clear that fluorescence microscopy, immunolabeling, and live cell imaging in combination have revolutionized our conceptual understanding of the structure and functioning of the eukaryotic Golgi apparatus and its relationship with the ER. However, the present superresolution fluorescence microscopic techniques such as structured illumination microscopy, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, and photoactivated localization microscopy are not sufficient to unequivocally identify discrete individual COPII vesicles. On the other hand, new techniques such as SCLIM are emerging that have the potential for even higher superresolution not only in space, but also in time and may well bring about a breakthrough in understanding what really is going on in living cells. Of course, electron microscopy is still the most powerful technique to solve the finer structural details of the interface between the ER and the Golgi whether in chemically fixed or frozen samples. Thus, perhaps a combination of ultra-rapid freezing and freeze substitution combined with selective membrane staining and one of the new high-resolution three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy technologies such as focussed ion beam-scanning electron microscopy or serial block face imaging might solve some of the mysteries of the plant ER-Golgi interface and help settle the controversy explored in this article. Unfortunately, irrespective of the method of preparation and the type of imaging, the downside with electron microscopy is that only single Golgi stacks can be visualized, with the caveat that the one being visualized might temporarily not be engaged in trafficking with the ER. There is also an issue with the experimental systems being used. Beautiful live-cell imaging data has been obtained with the leaf epidermis system, but obviously it will be interesting to explore other cell types. While it seems that the situation in tobacco BY2 cells is not too different from that of leaf epidermal cells, there are other cell types such as in the meristem or in the endosperm during cellularization whose secretion status is unclear and where it is difficult, especially by conventional live-cell imaging, to recognize a close spatial relationship between the ER and Golgi stacks, let alone being able to say anything about Golgi motility due to the sheer density of the cytoplasm. On the other hand, such cell types, because of their relatively high cytoplasm/cell volume ratio, freeze well and are therefore most suitable for electron microscopy studies. The reverse is true for leaf epidermal cells, which are excellent objects for live-cell imaging, but present an almost insurmountable obstacle for ultra-rapid freezing. It remains to say that, even with the ideal plant cell, to capture the complexity of bidirectional ER-Golgi traffic in plant cells, correlative light and electron microscopy is necessary. Establishing this technique for studies on plants is going to be a major challenge for the future.Glossary ER endoplasmic reticulum ERES endoplasmic reticulum exit site ERGIC endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment BFA brefeldin A Footnotes 1This work was supported by the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy (award no.

Copyright notice ID: 4902601 PMID: 27208234 High levels of methylesterification of pectin allow for enhanced cell expansion, partitioning of resources to leaf growth, and increased leaf area for photosynthesis, which in turn enhance plant growth.Abstract Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related (CGR) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area. Photosynthesis is the major source of carbon (C) for plant growth. However, there is no clear correlation between area-based photosynthesis and plant growth, and studies have shown that the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area growth parameters. A strong positive correlation exists between relative growth rate and leaf growth parameters such as leaf area per unit leaf mass (specific leaf area, SLA), leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio), and investment of C in leaf growth (leaf mass ratio; Shipley, 2002; Lambers et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 2009). In fact, modeled partitioning coefficients obtained from the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model showed that plant growth is more sensitive to changes in C partitioning to leaf thickening and leaf area growth than to changes to area-based photosynthesis (Weraduwage et al., 2015). The term “thickening” was used to indicate increased mass per unit leaf area (LMA), whether that results from increased thickness in the normal sense of more depth to the leaf between adaxial and abaxial surfaces or from increased cell density. LMA is the reciprocal of SLA. While LMA has been shown to positively and linearly correlate with investment to leaves in the form of anatomical and chemical composition changes, SLA shows a hyperbolic relationship with such changes (Poorter et al., 2009). Therefore, we will mainly focus on LMA throughout this work. Weraduwage et al. (2015) concluded that even though photosynthetic C is required for growth, the degree of growth is determined by the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth and LMA (Weraduwage et al., 2015). However, how and to what degree this variation in leaf expansion and LMA is affected by cell wall properties of leaf mesophyll cells is not known. In addition, the underlying mechanisms that drive C partitioning to favor either leaf area growth or LMA, and the genes that can influence changes in C demands toward these two processes, are yet to be found. Leaves are the major photosynthetic organs in plants and regulation of cell expansion and growth is crucial for the development of leaf architecture. Leaf growth can occur in the form of leaf area or LMA (Lambers et al., 2008; Weraduwage et al., 2015). The size and shape of cells in the leaf mesophyll can have a significant impact on: (1) projected or effective leaf surface area, which is the leaf area capable of intercepting light; (2) leaf mass per unit leaf area or LMA; (3) CO2 conductance from the external environment through intercellular air spaces into chloroplasts in mesophyll cells; and (4) surface area of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspaces (Honda and Fisher, 1978; Evans et al., 1994; Galmés et al., 2013). The plant cell wall controls expansion and positioning of cells of photosynthetic tissues and therefore, changes in cell wall properties will have a direct impact on the above properties. Although there is evidence for changes in leaf architecture as a result of alterations in genes that affect the synthesis and properties of the cell wall (Burton et al., 2000; Kim and Delaney, 2002; Pilling et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015), an in-depth analysis of effects on leaf gas exchange and overall plant growth under such circumstances has not yet been conducted. The plant cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides, and among these, pectin is considered a critical element that controls cell wall elasticity and expansion. Pectin is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and secreted in a highly methylesterified form. Methylesterification of galacturonic acid (GalUA) is catalyzed by pectin methyltransferases (Wolf et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015). The level of pectin methylesterification in the cell wall is controlled by methylesterases and inhibitors of methylesterases, which modify the levels of methylation and demethylation of GalUA in the pectin backbone (Wolf et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015). Removal of methyl groups by methylesterases allows carboxyl groups of GalUA to form Ca2+- and Mg2+-mediated intermolecular linkages that lead to hardening of pectin (Burton et al., 2000; Heldt and Piechulla, 2010; Kim et al., 2015). Indeed, over-expression of pectin methylesterase inhibitors results in longer root cells (Lionetti et al., 2007). Therefore, the degree of methylation and demethylation of pectin determines the delicate balance between cell wall extensibility and rigidity with consequent effects on growth and shape of cells (Burton et al., 2000; Pilling et al., 2004; Lionetti et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2009; Xiao and Anderson, 2013; Kim et al., 2015). Consistent with this notion, over-expression of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3, led to enhanced rosette size and fresh weight in Arabidopsis (Kim et al., 2015). However, a double knockout of CGR2 and CGR3 genes, named cgr2/3, showed reduced cell expansion and overall plant growth; both phenotypes correlated with reduced levels of pectin methylesterification compared to wild type (Kim et al., 2015). To our knowledge, the effect of pectin methylation on leaf growth parameters, photosynthesis, and respiration through its effect on leaf architecture has not been studied. The goal of this study was to use the Arabidopsis model system developed by Kim et al. (2015) with altered levels of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3 (single gene modifiers found to positively or negatively affect cell expansion as a function of their cellular availability) to investigate how changes in cell-wall plasticity affect C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We examined whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 could result from changes in leaf area growth and LMA or changes in area-based photosynthesis to explore the relationship between photosynthesis and growth. Based on the differences in rosette size reported previously (Kim et al., 2015), we hypothesized that area-based photosynthesis rates would be lower in a CGR2 over-expressor (CGR2OX) but larger in the mutant lacking both CGR2 and 3 genes (cgr2/3). As CGR2 and CGR3 affect pectin methylation and cell expansion in leaves, we also hypothesized that plant growth would be enhanced in the CGR2OX line and reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant mainly as a result of altered LMA. Indeed, through analysis of leaf and plant growth, gas exchange, and growth modeling, we found that CGR2 and CGR3 have significant impacts on photosynthesis and respiration through alteration of mesophyll structure and LMA. Plant growth was enhanced in the CGR2OX line but reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant. This variation in plant growth was as a result of differences in C partitioning and not as a result of changes in photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. These observations support a novel (to our knowledge) model that changes in cell wall plasticity due to changes in pectin composition influence C partitioning between leaf area growth and LMA, thereby regulating the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth. RESULTS CGR2OX and cgr2/3 Mutant Lines Retained Altered Cell Wall Composition Cell wall composition of Col-0 (wild type), cgr2/3 complemented with CGR2 (cgr2com), CGR2OX, and cgr2/3 was analyzed to determine whether the previously observed changes in methylesterification and modification of cell wall polysaccharides by Kim et al. (2015) were retained in the mutant lines. Similar to what was seen by Kim et al. (2015), crystalline cellulose content was lower in cgr2/3 mutant line and it was greater in CGR2OX than that in Col-0 (Supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, the content of neutral sugars such as fucose, arabinose, and glucose was significantly higher in cgr2/3 than Col-0, as was shown by Kim et al. (2015; Supplemental Fig. S1B). The uronic-acid content and the amount of methylesters per uronic acid were greater in CGR2OX compared to wild type; the uronic-acid content was lower in cgr2/3 (Supplemental Fig. S1C). These data support that the cell wall composition, including pectin and the degree of methylesterification, is altered in the CGR2OX and cgr2/3 mutant lines in response to altered CGR2 and CGR3 gene expression, as previously reported in Kim et al. (2015).Enhanced Pectin Methylesterification Increased Leaf Area while a Decrease in Pectin Methylesterification Reduced Leaf Area Hypocotyl length and cotyledon and leaf areas were measured to determine how altered expression of CGR2 and CGR3 affects early seedling growth and expansion of the leaf blade. Similar to earlier results (Kim et al., 2015), hypocotyls of CGR2OX were significantly longer than wild type, while those of cgr2/3 were shorter (Supplemental Figs. S2A and S3A). Cotyledon area was also smaller in cgr2/3 than Col-0 (Supplemental Fig. S3B). The CGR2OX mutant produced rosettes with greater projected and total leaf area compared to Col-0 throughout the lifecycle (Fig. 1, Supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). In contrast, a significant reduction in projected and total leaf area was observed in cgr2/3. The degree of leaf overlap measured by the ratio between projected and total leaf area was not different between the transgenic lines and Col-0 (Fig. 1). Thus, functional availability of CGR2 and CGR3 has a significant impact on leaf area growth. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Projected and total leaf area over time in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, Projected leaf area and B, total leaf area at four different harvests (H) is presented for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3.

Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Genetic Depletion of CGR2 and CGR3 Results in Thin Leaves with Small, Densely Packed Mesophyll Cells Leaf area and thickness are generally negatively correlated (Lambers et al., 2008; Weraduwage et al., 2015). To determine whether changes in leaf area in CGR2OX and cgr2/3 were accompanied by changes in leaf thickness, we measured leaf thickness. Interestingly, leaves of cgr2/3 were both thin and of small leaf area (Fig. 2, A and B); this trend was observed throughout the lifecycle (data not shown). During early vegetative growth [34 d after seeding (DAS)], CGR2OX produced thinner leaves with a tendency toward more area than Col-0. Nonetheless, the CGR2OX leaves were thicker than those of cgr2/3. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Leaf thickness and anatomy in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, Representative micrographs of leaf cross sections; B, leaf thickness; C, the relationship between the number of mesophyll cells and size of the intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll; D, the surface area of mesophyll cells exposed to intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area (Smes); and E, the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area (Sc) are presented for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3. In (A), leaf thickness is denoted by red double arrows. Data were obtained from 34-d old leaves. In (B), (D), and (E), values represent the mean ± se and n = 4 plants per line. In (C), n = 4 plants per line were used to obtain the mean values for the area of air spaces as a % of area of leaf cross section and the number of mesophyll cells per mm2 of leaf cross section. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Next, we determined whether CGR2- and CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification was correlated with changes in mesophyll architecture. CGR2OX had larger palisade cells and 3 to 4 mesophyll cell layers compared to Col-0, which produced 4 to 5 layers of comparatively smaller palisade cells (Fig. 2A). However, the mesophyll cells of cgr2/3 were significantly smaller and more numerous than in Col-0 (Fig. 2A), which led to a marked reduction in intercellular airspaces in the leaf mesophyll (Fig. 2C). Consequently, a significant negative correlation was observed between the number of cells and intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll (Fig. 2C). Enhanced cell density and the reduction in intercellular air spaces in cgr2/3 compared to the other Arabidopsis lines also led to a significant reduction in mesophyll cell surface area (Smes) and chloroplast surface area (Sc) exposed to intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly also, the number of chloroplasts per unit area of a leaf cross section was lower in CGR2OX and greater in cgr2/3 compared to Col-0 (Fig. 3A). However, the average size of chloroplasts was smaller in all transgenic lines compared to Col-0 (Fig. 3B). The data indicate that the reduction in Sc in cgr2/3 was not a result of a reduction in chloroplast area per unit leaf area, but instead was linked to the significant reduction in intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll. Therefore, our results show that variations in the levels of methylesterification of the cell wall significantly impact leaf thickness, cell density, and mesophyll architecture. Figure 3.

Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Changes in Mesophyll Architecture due to Alterations in CGR-Expression Affected Area-Based Photosynthesis and Respiration We next aimed to establish whether changes in mesophyll architecture as well as projected and total leaf areas affect net C assimilation in mutant lines with altered CGR-expression. To do this, we measured area- and plant-based photosynthesis and respiration. During early vegetative growth, at around 29 DAS, area-based photosynthesis in cgr2/3 was significantly higher than the other lines (Fig. 4A). Afterward, cgr2/3 showed lower area-based photosynthesis rates compared to Col-0 throughout the vegetative growth phase (Fig. 4A). Area-based photosynthesis in CGR2OX was lower than Col-0 around 49 DAS, but remained higher compared to cgr2/3. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Photosynthesis and respiration over time in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, Area-based photosynthesis, B, area-based nighttime respiration, C, photosynthesis on a whole plant basis, and D, night-time respiration on a whole plant basis at four different harvests (H) is shown for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3. Photosynthesis (C gain) is shown as a positive number (A, C) while respiration (C loss) is shown as a negative number (B, D). H1, H2, H3, and H4 correspond to 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS, respectively. For clarity, the scale of the Y-axis for H1 in (C) and (D) is presented on the left-hand-side. Values represent the mean ± se and n = 5 plants per line. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.We also established that area-based respiration in cgr2/3 was 2 to 5 times greater than Col-0 (Fig. 4B). Thus, photosynthesis/respiration ratio remained significantly smaller in cgr2/3 throughout the lifecycle (Fig. 5A). Although not statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, CGR2OX showed a trend toward lower area-based respiration (Fig. 4B) and therefore, its photosynthesis/respiration ratio appeared to be greater in young rosette leaves at 29 DAS (Fig. 5A). Increased area-based respiration in cgr2/3 and lower area-based respiration in CGR2OX correlated well with the differences in the number of mesophyll cells in these lines (Fig. 2C). In general, plant-based photosynthesis in CGR2OX was similar to Col-0 with an upward trend, even though area-based photosynthesis was smaller (Fig. 4, A and C); this was mainly due to the larger projected leaf area in CGR2OX (Fig. 1A). However, owing to its smaller projected leaf area, plant-based photosynthesis in cgr2/3 was much lower than Col-0 (Fig. 4C). Plant-based respiration was greater in CGR2OX, and smaller in cgr2/3 than in Col-0 (Fig. 4D), which could be explained by differences in total leaf area (Fig. 1B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Daily C gain in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, Photosynthesis/respiration ratio at four different harvests (H); B, The daily C gain at two different harvests for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3 is given. H1, H2, H3, and H4 correspond to 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS, respectively. Values represent the mean ± se and n = 5 plants per line. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Daily C gain in rosettes was greater in CGR2OX compared to Col-0 when measured at 29 and 49 DAS, while it was significantly smaller in cgr2/3 (Fig. 5B). The upward trend in daily C gain observed in CGR2OX was a result of its higher plant-based photosynthetic rates due to greater projected leaf area (Figs. 1A and 4C). The decrease in C gain in cgr2/3 resulted from reduced plant-based photosynthesis due to the smaller projected leaf area and smaller photosynthesis/respiration ratio compared to CGR2OX (Figs. 1A, 4C, and 5A). Together these results support the hypothesis that by controlling leaf area and mesophyll architecture, pectin methylesterification is a critical factor for regulation of whole-plant rates of photosynthesis and respiration.Suppression of Pectin Methylesterification Led to a Reduction in CO2 Availability for Photosynthesis The differences in chloroplast number and size could not account for the large differences observed in area-based photosynthesis between cgr2/3 and the other three Arabidopsis lines (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, to investigate whether lower area-based photosynthesis rates in cgr2/3 at harvests 2, 3, and 4 were a result of a reduction in CO2 availability owing to altered mesophyll architecture, the degree of 13C discrimination was analyzed in leaf tissue of the four Arabidopsis lines. The 13C content of cgr2/3 was greater, consistent with less discrimination against 13CO2 during photosynthesis compared to the other lines (Fig. 6, A–C). The average CO2 partial pressure at Rubisco calculated using the δ13CVPDB (Vienna-Pee-Dee Belemnite, VPDB) values showed CO2 availability to be significantly lower in cgr2/3 (Fig. 6, D–F). These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that there is a greater resistance to CO2 diffusion into chloroplasts of cgr2/3, owing to lower surface areas of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts facing intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area as a result of enhanced cell density and reduced intercellular air spaces (Fig. 2, C–E). Therefore, reduction in CGR2 and CGR3 availability appears to have a strong negative impact on area-based photosynthesis owing to reduction in CO2 availability to chloroplasts, most likely as a result of altered mesophyll architecture. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Degree of resistance to CO2 diffusion through the leaf mesophyll over time in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, B, C, The δ13CVPDB value calculated as the ratio of 13C to 12C isotopes in leaf tissue relative to a VPDB value; D, E, F, CO2 partial pressure at Rubisco at three different harvests (H) is shown for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3. H2, H3, and H4 correspond to 49, 63, and 82 DAS, respectively. Values represent the mean ± se and n = 5 plants per line. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.A Decrease in Pectin Methylesterification Increased LMA, and Reduced Plant Growth and Relative Growth Rates We next analyzed the effects of altered expression of CGR2 and CGR3 on plant growth by measuring leaf growth parameters, plant biomass, and relative growth rates. We found that LMA was higher in cgr2/3 during the early to late vegetative phases, around 29 to 63 DAS (Fig. 7A). In addition, LMA in CGR2OX remained significantly lower than in cgr2/3. Leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio) and leaf mass ratio (mass of leaf per unit plant mass) were significantly smaller in cgr2/3 than other lines (Fig. 7, B and C). In contrast, root mass ratio (mass of root per unit plant mass) was larger in cgr2/3 than other lines (Fig. 7D). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Variations in leaf growth parameters over time in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, LMA, B, leaf area ratio, C, leaf mass ratio, and D, root mass ratio at four different harvests (H) for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3 is presented. H1, H2, H3, and H4 correspond to 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS, respectively. Values represent the mean and n = 5 plants per line. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Interestingly, CGR2OX maintained the greatest leaf, root, and plant biomass throughout the lifecycle (Fig. 8, A–D). In contrast, cgr2/3 plants exhibited a significant reduction in leaf, root, and plant dry weight throughout the lifecycle. Collectively, these data reveal that alterations in CGR2 and CGR3 expression can have a significant effect not only on leaf growth, but also on overall plant growth. Therefore, while an increase in pectin methylesterification enhances plant biomass, a decrease in pectin methylesterification reduces it. Modeled relative growth rates revealed that both area-based (Fig. 9A) and mass-based (Fig. 9B) relative growth rates were higher in CGR2OX and smaller in cgr2/3 than Col-0 during most part of the lifecycle. In summary, alterations in CGR2 and CGR3 have a significant impact on important leaf growth parameters such as LMA, and biomass partitioning to leaf growth, and also affect plant growth in terms of biomass accumulation and relative growth rates. LMA showed a negative correlation with plant growth and relative growth rates. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Variations in dry weight over time in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. A, Leaf, B, root, C, inflorescence, and D, whole plant dry weight at four different harvests (H) for Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3 is given.

Values represent the mean ± se and n = 5 plants per line. Statistical differences at α = 0.05 are marked with lower-case letters.Figure 9.

A, Area-based relative growth rates and B, mass-based relative growth rates simulated from days 5 to 84 using the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model fitted with data obtained from Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3 are presented.Enhanced Pectin Methylesterification and C Partitioning to Leaf Area Growth The Arabidopsis leaf area growth model parameterized with measurements obtained from the four Arabidopsis lines was used to estimate how much C was partitioned to new leaf area growth and LMA, as a proportion of net assimilated C that is available for growth. These values, referred to as partitioning coefficients (Table I), would allow determination of whether changes in CGR2 and CGR3 availability could affect C partitioning to growth or respiratory processes. The proportions of C partitioned to leaf growth in total (C partitioned to area + LMA), and to root growth found by 14CO2 feeding experiments at 29 DAS, were used as an initial estimate when setting the partitioning coefficients to leaf growth for the early vegetative growth phase (Supplemental Fig. S4; Table I). Partitioning coefficients obtained from growth modeling for CGR2OX revealed that, compared to the other lines, the CGR2 over-expression line partitioned more of the C available for leaf growth toward leaf area growth and less toward LMA, especially during the early vegetative phase (Table I). In contrast, we found that in cgr2/3 a significantly greater proportion of C was allocated to LMA rather than to leaf area growth (Table I). The differences in C partitioning to leaf area growth and LMA between Col-0 and CGR2OX and cgr2/3 were most prominent during early vegetative phases of growth. Table I.

The durations of the early and late vegetative phases and the reproductive phase for each line is as follows: for Col-0, 5–51 DAS, 52–74 DAS, and 75–90 DAS; for cgr2com, 5–48 DAS, 49–70 DAS, and 71–90 DAS; for CGR2OX, 5–49 DAS, 50–72 DAS, and 73–90 DAS; and for cgr2/3, assuming flower initiation started at 82 DAS, 5–55 DAS, 56–81 DAS, and 82–90 DAS.The patterns of C partitioning in transgenic lines seen in Table I were further investigated by determining the amounts of C being partitioned to specific growth processes as well as respiratory processes as a proportion of the total available C in the plant (Fig. 10). CGR2OX still partitioned a greater proportion of total available C to leaf area growth and a lesser proportion to LMA compared to the other lines; cgr2/3 showed an opposite trend to that seen in CGR2OX (Fig. 10). The maintenance respiratory cost increased as the plant aged. Toward the end of its lifecycle (82 DAS), close to 75% of assimilated C was consumed in maintenance respiration (Fig. 10). While the maintenance costs in CGR2OX were somewhat larger than Col-0 toward the end of the lifecycle, a significant enhancement in the proportion of C spent in maintenance respiration could be seen in cgr2/3 throughout the lifecycle (Fig. 10). Collectively, these data provide evidence to support that alteration in CGR2 and CGR3 expression has a significant impact on determining the proportions of C partitioned to new leaf area growth versus LMA, and to maintenance respiration in plants. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Modeled C partitioning to growth and respiration in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. Carbon partitioned to support growth in terms of leaf area and LMA, and inflorescence growth, root growth, and maintenance and growth respiration is presented as percentages of the daily available C at 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS. Data were derived from the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model fitted with data obtained from Col-0, cgr2com, CGR2OX, and cgr2/3.Growth in CGR2OX and cgr2/3 was Affected More by Alterations in C Partitioning than by Changes in Area-Based Photosynthesis To determine whether the alterations in growth observed in CGR2OX and cgr2/3 were a result of alterations in area-based photosynthesis (Fig. 4A) or partitioning coefficients to leaf area growth and LMA growth (Table I), the values for these parameters in the growth model for Col-0 were substituted separately by corresponding values from the two transgenic lines. Interestingly, by keeping the partitioning coefficients the same, substitution of area-based photosynthesis rates for 1 to 90 d with those of CGR2OX resulted in a small reduction in modeled growth in Col-0 whereas cgr2/3 caused a large increase in growth (gray lines in Fig. 11). Figure 11. Open in a new tab Comparison of the effects of altered area-based photosynthesis and C partitioning coefficients on plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression. Modeled effects on leaf area and leaf, root, and plant dry weights when either photosynthetic rates or partitioning coefficients spanning the entire growth cycle for Col-0 are replaced by those of (A) CGR2OX and (B) cgr2/3 are presented. In (A) and (B), blue lines represent modeled growth for Col-0, and red squares represent measured data points (mean ± sd) for Col-0 at 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS. Gray lines represent modeled data for Col-0 when its area-based photosynthesis rates are replaced by that of either CGR2OX (A) or cgr2/3 (B). Orange lines represent modeled data for Col-0 when its partitioning coefficients (Table I) are replaced by that of either CGR2OX (A) or cgr2/3 (B) without making any changes to area-based photosynthesis rates of Col-0. In (A), asterisks represent measured data for CGR2OX at 63 and 82 DAS. In (B), the dotted line indicates the upper limit of measured data for cgr2/3.However, by keeping area-based photosynthesis the same, substituting the partitioning coefficients of Col-0 with that of CGR2OX had a strikingly large positive effect on modeled growth; cgr2/3 partitioning coefficients had a significantly large negative effect on growth that mirrored the observed differences in growth in the CGR2 over-expression line and the CGR2 and CGR3 double mutant line (orange lines in Fig. 11). These observed changes in growth could be achieved by substituting the partitioning coefficients of only the early vegetative growth phase (data not shown). The data show that the observed changes plant growth in CGR2OX and cgr2/3 were not a result of differences in photosynthetic rates, but a result of differences in C partitioning to growth in terms of leaf area and LMA, especially during early vegetative growth. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that the magnitude of plant growth is determined by how photosynthetic C is partitioned to new leaf area growth and LMA.DISCUSSION In this study, we investigated how modification of cell wall plasticity via the genetic manipulation of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 and CGR3, affects C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We also wanted to further understand the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth by determining whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered cellular availability of CGR2 and CGR3 were a result of changes in growth in terms of leaf area and LMA or due to changes in area-based photosynthesis. We found that over-expression of CGR2 had a significant positive effect on leaf area and plant growth. On the other hand, suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 expression caused a marked increase in LMA and a reduction in leaf area and plant growth. Altered expression of CGR2 and CGR3 also had a significant impact on photosynthesis and respiration through altered mesophyll architecture. The differences in plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 levels were linked to changes in C partitioning to leaf area growth and LMA rather than altered area-based photosynthesis rates. These findings establish that CGR2- and CGR3-mediated pectin methylesterification affects mesophyll architecture, C accumulation, C partitioning, leaf and plant growth, and the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth. CGR2 and CGR3 Directly Affect Leaf Mass per Unit Area by Altering Both Leaf Thickness and the Mass of Leaf per Unit Volume of Leaf Tissue Often, thicker leaves are associated with larger LMA due to an increase in the number of cell layers, which can increase leaf mass per unit leaf area (Lambers et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 2009; Villar et al., 2013; Weraduwage et al., 2015). However, a negative correlation exists between leaf mass density or LMD (mass of leaf per unit volume of leaf tissue) and leaf thickness, and both parameters can affect LMA as follows: LMD (kg m−3) = leaf mass/(leaf area × leaf thickness) and LMA (kg m−2) = LMD × leaf thickness (Witkowski and Lamont, 1991; Lambers et al., 2008; Poorter et al., 2009; Villar et al., 2013). Therefore, leaf thickening or an increase in LMA can occur due to an increase in leaf thickness or LMD. While thicker leaves have been shown to be associated with larger mesophyll cells (elongated, especially in the depth direction) and larger air spaces, LMD has been associated with smaller proportions of intercellular air spaces and smaller cells (Tsuge et al., 1996; Poorter et al., 2009; Villar et al., 2013). In addition to being affected by anatomical changes, LMA and LMD can also be determined by variations in cellular and chemical composition (Cunningham et al., 1999; Lambers et al., 2008). For example, plants with slow growth rates possess a larger number of smaller cells with thicker cell walls, and a greater proportion of lignin and other cell wall polysaccharides per unit leaf area that can increase LMD and LMA (Cunningham et al., 1999; Lambers et al., 2008). A key aspect of cellular mass is represented by organelles, and plants with higher growth rates may possess large cells with a lower number of chloroplasts, which results in lower LMA (Lambers et al., 2008). Interestingly, while both CGR2OX and cgr2/3 had thinner leaves compared to Col-0, cgr2/3 showed a significant increase in LMA. Such increase in cgr2/3 can be attributed to increased LMD as a result of enhanced cell density and reduction of intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll. Smaller cells can lead to concentration of cellular metabolites, which can also lead to increased LMD. In addition, cgr2/3 also possessed a larger number of chloroplasts per unit leaf area. The proportions of cell wall components per unit leaf area are also likely greater in cgr2/3 compared to the other backgrounds. Therefore, collectively the data clearly show that although cgr2/3 had thinner leaves, enhanced LMD led to greater leaf mass per unit area (or lower SLA) in cgr2/3. Conversely, LMA in CGR2OX was significantly smaller than cgr2/3. Leaves of CGR2OX were also thicker than cgr2/3 and contained larger intercellular airspaces, and larger cells with a lower number of chloroplasts. Therefore, our results support that variation in LMA between CGR2OX and cgr2/3 resulted from the combination of increased leaf thickness and reduced leaf mass density. The significant alterations in mesophyll architecture observed during this study are linked to changes in CGR2 and CGR3 expression. Based on the model that reduced methylation of pectin may enhance Ca2+-mediated cross linking of GalUA in cell walls, thereby preventing normal cell expansion in cgr2/3 (Burton et al., 2000; Wolf et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2015), we propose that the larger number of smaller mesophyll cells observed in cgr2/3 during this study is likely linked to the hardening of the cell wall and consequent restriction of cell wall expansion. This in turn is likely to cause an increase of the cell number per unit leaf area in cgr2/3 compared to Col-0. In addition, cross linking between GalUA and Ca2+ in cell wall pectin is required for cellular adhesion (Caffall and Mohnen, 2009). Also a reduction in GalUA-Ca2+ complex formation in Solanum lycopersicum resulted in large air spaces in the fruit pericarp caused by dramatic reductions in the middle-lamellae-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion (Caffall and Mohnen, 2009). The observed decrease in air spaces in cgr2/3 and the dense distribution of the cells (hence thinner leaves) are likely due to enhanced cell-to-cell adhesion because of the lower degree of methylesterified pectin in cgr2/3 compared to Col-0. In contrast, enhanced methylation of pectin promotes cell expansion (Kim et al., 2015); this resulted in the observed presence of wider palisade cells and a lower number of cell layers (hence thinner leaves) in CGR2OX than Col-0. The number of cells and area of airspaces in CGR2OX differed only marginally from Col-0. However, CGR2OX did have a smaller number of smaller chloroplasts compared to Col-0, which may be an indication of lower LMA. Whether over-expression of CGR2 has a dosage effect, and over-expression of both CGR2 and CGR3 would result in larger and thicker leaves with lower cell density remains to be investigated. Thinner leaves usually correlate with larger SLA or smaller LMA (Lambers et al., 2008; Weraduwage et al., 2015). However, based on the negative correlation between LMD and leaf thickness, it is likely that LMD would start to increase should leaf thickness decrease below a certain optimum, thereby resulting in an increase in LMA. This was demonstrated in cgr2/3, where suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 resulted in leaves that were too thin, leading to higher cell density and LMA. This can have significant negative effects on leaf gas exchange properties and daily C gain, as discussed below. The above phenotype was rescued by complementing with CGR2, as seen in cgr2com or by over-expressing CGR2 as in CGR2OX. Thus, the degree of CGR2- and CGR3-mediated pectin methyl esterification can directly affect LMA by altering both leaf thickness and leaf mass density. CGR2 and CGR3 Affect Area-Based Respiration and Daily C Gain by Altering LMD and LMA In general, leaves growing under high light develop thicker leaves with multiple cell layers and higher LMA (lower SLA), and incurs higher area-based respiration rates corresponding to their greater mass per unit leaf area (Mitchell et al., 1999; Lambers et al., 2008). In contrast, plants grown under low light have lower LMA (higher SLA), which optimizes light capture and lowers area-based respiration rates (Lambers et al., 2008). This assists in maximizing daily C gain and compensates for lower area-based photosynthesis rates when growing under low light conditions (Lambers et al., 2008). Although cgr2/3 produced thinner leaves, the marked enhancement in area-based respiration positively correlated with enhanced leaf cell density and higher LMA. Higher area-based respiratory rates led to smaller photosynthesis/respiration ratio, and when coupled with smaller projected leaf area, they had a significant negative impact on daily carbon gain. Thus, pectin methylesterification affects area-based respiration rates through alterations in leaf cell density, LMD, and LMA and consequently affect photosynthetic efficiency in plants. CGR2 and CGR3 Directly Affect Area-Based Photosynthesis by Altering Mesophyll Architecture Diffusion of CO2 into chloroplasts occurs along the path that poses the least resistance through the cell wall, plasma membrane, chloroplast envelope, and into the chloroplast stroma (Terashima et al., 2006). Therefore, Sc represents the active area through which CO2 diffuses in to the chloroplast stroma (Terashima et al., 2006). A decrease in Sc leads to a reduction in CO2 concentration at Rubisco and therefore to a reduction in the carboxylation/oxygenation ratio (Terashima et al., 2006). Parameters that affect CO2 diffusion into the chloroplast stroma are thickness of the mesophyll cell wall, internal conductance to CO2 diffusion, and stomatal conductance (Terashima et al., 2006). Sc has been shown to be positively correlated with internal conductance, while the latter is negatively correlated with cell wall thickness (Terashima et al., 2006). In contrast to our original hypothesis, area-based photosynthesis rates were significantly lower in cgr2/3 for most of the lifecycle, even though this mutant possessed smaller projected leaf area and denser leaves. This study revealed that this reduction in area-based photosynthesis in cgr2/3 was not a result of differences in chloroplast number and size, but, mainly a result of a reduction in CO2 partial pressure at Rubisco due to restrictions imposed on CO2 diffusion by increased cell density and reduced airspaces in the leaf mesophyll that lowered Sc. Preliminary investigations revealed that stomatal conductance is not negatively impacted in the mutant lines examined during this study (data not shown). Therefore, the observed reduction in area-based photosynthetic rates is most probably due to a cumulative effect of lower Sc, higher internal resistance and greater cell wall thickness per unit area. The greater area-based photosynthesis rates in cgr2/3 observed during early stages of vegetative development may have been a result of leaves and cell walls being comparatively thinner in young plants. Sc values and CO2 partial pressure at Rubisco in cgr2/3 were restored to the levels of Col-0 in cgr2com owing to alterations brought about by CGR2 expression in its leaf anatomy: thicker leaves with less dense mesophyll and more intercellular air spaces. Sc and CO2 partial pressure in CGR2OX were similar to that of Col-0. The lower area-based photosynthesis in CGR2OX may have resulted from thinner but larger leaves, which may have then resulted in less photosynthetic machinery per unit leaf area. Correspondingly, chloroplast number and size were lower in CGR2OX. These data emphasize the importance of pectin methylesterification in fine-tuning cell expansion and size and cell-to-cell adhesion qualities in building a leaf mesophyll optimized for CO2 exchange. While thin leaves are associated with lower LMA (or enhanced SLA), it is important to maintain an optimum thickness to maintain sufficient intercellular air spaces, which would maintain high internal conductance, Smes, and Sc, and therefore higher carboxylation rates.Pectin Methylesterification Mediates the Relationship between Photosynthesis and Plant Growth through Alterations in C Partitioning to Leaf Area Growth and Thickening As hypothesized, suppression of CGR2- and CGR3-mediated pectin methylesterification had a profound negative effect on leaf area growth while over-expression of CGR2 significantly enhanced leaf area growth. Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 also led to a reduction in plant dry weight. Over-expression of CGR2 enhanced plant dry weight. Growth modeling revealed that the observed variations in growth were not caused by changes in area-based photosynthesis. In fact, high rates of area-based photosynthesis measured in cgr2/3 during early growth were found to be sufficient to drive growth higher than that seen in Col-0. Thus, growth had the opposite trend (CGROX > Col-0 > cgr2/3) compared with area-based photosynthetic rate (cgr2/3 > Col-0 > CGROX). To account for enhanced overall plant growth, the amount of net assimilated C available for growth has to increase, which will depend on the total amount of C assimilated and the amount of C respired to support maintenance processes (Weraduwage et al., 2015). Our study showed that CGR2 and CGR3, through pectin methylesterification, are capable of affecting total C assimilation by directly altering leaf area growth and by altering maintenance respiratory costs through direct effects on LMA. We also showed that although CGR2 and CGR3 affect area-based photosynthetic rates, the latter is not a major factor affecting overall plant growth. A reduction in pectin methylesterification by reduced expression of CGR2 and CGR3 seems to enhance cell-wall hardening and cell-to-cell adhesion through increased cross linking between GalUA and Ca2+, favoring an increase in LMA against cell expansion and posing a greater demand for C for LMA growth compared to area growth (Fig. 12A). Hence less C will be utilized in area growth of new leaves and more C will be utilized in increasing LMA, leading to a smaller projected leaf area (Fig. 12A). Smaller projected leaf area yields lower whole plant C assimilation. In contrast, an increase in pectin methylesterification via enhanced expression of CGR2 and CGR3 seems to reduce cell wall hardening and cell-to-cell adhesion, and thereby favors cell expansion and area growth against increases in LMA; it poses a greater demand for C for leaf area growth compared to that for LMA growth (Fig. 12B). Hence, more C will be utilized in area growth of new leaves, and a lower proportion C will be utilized in LMA growth, leading to larger projected leaf area and enhanced whole-plant C assimilation (Fig. 12B). Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 increases respiratory costs through higher LMA, resulting in lower photosynthesis/respiration ratio, lower daily C gain, reduced net assimilated C available for growth, and ultimately reduced plant growth (Fig. 12A); over-expression of CGR2 yields opposite physiological effects (Fig. 12B). Figure 12. Open in a new tab CGR2- and CGR3-mediated pectin methylesterification regulates the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth. A schematic diagram outlining how (A) suppression or (B) over-expression of CGR2 and CGR3 gene expression affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth in Arabidopsis is presented. Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 reduces the degree of pectin methylation, which leads to an increase in cell-to-cell adhesion, cation-mediated cross linking of GalUA, and consequent hardening of cell walls. CGR2 over-expression increases the degree of pectin methylation, which allows cell expansion through reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and cation-mediated cross linking. We propose that pectin methyltransferase enzyme, through its ability to directly alter cell expansion, determines the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth versus growth in terms of LMA. For example, while more C is partitioned to growth in terms of LMA in the CGR2 and CGR3 double knockout mutant, in the CGR2 over-expression line more C is partitioned to leaf area growth. An increase in LMA leads to enhanced area-based respiration and a reduction in leaf area contribute to a reduction in whole plant photosynthesis. Collectively, this results in a reduction in C available for growth and consequently a decrease in overall plant growth; an opposite trend is seen in CGR2OX. Thus, CGR2 and CGR3, through their ability to alter the degree of methylated pectin in the cell wall of the mesophyll cells, determine how photosynthate is utilized to grow the plant. In other words, CGR2- and CGR3-mediated pectin methylesterification affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth by regulating the proportions of C that is partitioned to leaf area growth and LMA. Final overall growth mainly depends on the expression patterns of CGR2 and CGR3 and how much C is partitioned to area growth and LMA and not on area-based photosynthesis. PME: pectin methylesterase; PMEI: PME inhibitor; PMT: pectin methyltransferase. CH3OH is methanol.There may be other genes that also impact partitioning of carbon toward leaf area growth or LMA. One example is the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene family. Reduced expression of XTH8 and XTH31 gene expression led to reduced leaf width, length, and leaf area (Miura and Hasegawa, 2010). The leaf mesophyll of these mutant lines consisted of a large number of small mesophyll cells per unit area (Miura and Hasegawa, 2010). Suppression of XTH21 led to a reduction in cellulose, and xyloglucan content with subsequent reductions in both leaf and plant size (Liu et al., 2007). One of the major roles of XTH enzymes is cleavage of cross linkages between cellulose and hemicellulose microfibrils that promotes wall loosening and cell expansion. This may explain the above leaf phenotypes in xth8, xth21, and xth31 mutant lines (Liu et al., 2007; Miura and Hasegawa, 2010). Thus, through its effects on cell wall properties, XTH genes may be able to alter C partitioning to leaf area and LMA and thereby affect overall plant growth similar to the role played by CGR genes. In summary, the results from this study are in agreement with findings from Weraduwage et al. (2015) that optimization of leaf area growth and plant growth can be achieved by increased partitioning of C to leaf area growth with concomitant reduction in partitioning to growth in terms of LMA especially during the early vegetative growth phase (Weraduwage et al., 2015), and that photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in C partitioning to leaf area and LMA growth. In this study, we found that CGR2 and CGR3 directly affect this relationship by altering the degree of cell expansion and/or adhesion, thereby driving C partitioning by generating C demands for leaf area growth and for growth in terms of LMA.CONCLUSION Our study supports the model that qualitative and quantitative changes in pectin in the cell wall have a significant impact on area-based photosynthesis and respiration through alterations in leaf thickness, mesophyll cell density, and area of the leaf blade. Such changes in mesophyll architecture directly altered LMA and consequently area-based respiration. CGR2 and CGR3 affected area-based photosynthesis by altering CO2 availability at Rubisco. These genes could affect plant-based photosynthesis by enabling enhanced light capture through larger leaf area. These data emphasizes the importance of pectin methylesterification in fine-tuning cell expansion and size, and adhesion qualities when building an optimum leaf to maximize photosynthesis under different environmental conditions. While thin leaves are associated with reduced LMA, it is important to maintain an optimum thickness to maintain sufficient intercellular air spaces that would maintain high internal conductance as reflected in Smes and Sc and therefore higher carboxylation rates. CGR2 and CGR3, which directly alter the size of the leaf blade and mesophyll architecture, may find applications in the future to improve light interception in crop plant canopies. Over-expression of CGR2 had a significant positive effect on leaf area and plant growth. Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 caused a marked increase in LMA, and a reduction in leaf area and plant growth. These differences resulted through changes in C partitioning to leaf area growth and growth in terms of LMA and not as a result of altered area-based photosynthesis rates. Therefore, photosynthesis drives plant growth through alterations in C partitioning to new leaf area growth and LMA growth, and this study discovered that pectin methylesterification affects this relationship by directly altering the degree of cell expansion and positioning in the leaves to create dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass thereby driving C partitioning for these processes. Collectively, these results uncover an unexpected connection between cell wall composition and photosynthesis, and support the novel (to our knowledge) model that through its role in modulation of organ development, the cell wall plasticity is a key factor influencing photosynthetic processes in land plants.MATERIALS AND METHODS Growth Analysis Wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0), cgr2/3 (loss of function double mutant line of CGR2 and CGR3), CGR2OX (CGR2 over-expression line), and cgr2com (cgr2/3 complemented by CGR2) (Kim et al., 2015) were used in the study. Gene accession numbers for CGR2 and CGR3 are At3g49720 and At5g65810, respectively. Plants were grown hydroponically in 1/2-strength Hoagland’s solution under a light intensity of 120 μmol m−2 s−1, using 8-h photoperiods with respective day- and night-time temperatures of 22°C and 20°C, and 60% relative humidity. The hydroponics system was housed in a model no. GC-20 Bigfoot Series Growth Chamber (BioChambers, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Plant growth parameters including projected and total leaf area, leaf, root, and inflorescence dry weights, relative growth rates, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), leaf area ratio, and leaf, root, and inflorescence mass ratios were measured as described in Weraduwage et al. (2015). When calculating SLA, LMA, leaf area ratio, and leaf, root, and inflorescence mass ratios, the total leaf area, and organ and plant mass corresponding to each harvest was used: SLA (m2 kg−1) = total leaf area/leaf mass; LMA (kg m−2) = leaf mass/total leaf area; leaf area ratio (m2 kg−1) = total leaf area/total plant mass; and leaf, root or inflorescence mass ratio (g g−1) = leaf, root, or inflorescence mass/total plant mass. Growth measurements were obtained throughout the lifecycle of the plant at 2–3-week intervals at 29, 49, 63, and 82 d after seeding (DAS). The 100-seed weight prior to stratification and sowing, cotyledon area, and hypocotyl length was also measured.Determination of Leaf Thickness, Mesophyll Cell Density, Smes, Sc, and Chloroplast Size and Abundance Leaves of similar age from 34- and 51-d-old rosettes were used for anatomical measurements. Leaves were harvested and processed for leaf cross sectioning as described in Weraduwage et al. (2015), at the Center for Advanced Microscopy, Michigan State University. Thin (500-nm) leaf sections (PTXL Ultramicrotome; RMC Boeckeler Instruments, Tucson, AZ) were observed under a SpectralView FV1000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY), and the distance between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces was measured to determine leaf thickness. Micrographs of leaf cross sections were used to determine the number of palisade and spongy parenchyma cells, the total number of cells, and the number of mesophyll cell layers in a 20,000 μm2 area of a leaf cross section. These data were later expressed per mm2. ImageJ (http://imagej. nih.gov/ij/) software was utilized to measure the total area of intercellular air spaces, total length of mesophyll cells, total length of mesophyll cells exposed to intercellular air spaces (Lmes), and the total length of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular air spaces (Lc). The latter three measurements were utilized to determine the surface area of mesophyll cells exposed to intercellular air spaces (Smes) and the surface area of chloroplast exposed to intercellular air spaces (Sc) per unit leaf area as described in Evans et al. (1994). A series of z-stack images of leaves of 34-d-old plants was acquired using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (model no. LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss; http://www.zeiss.com). Chloroplasts were imaged using an ECPlan-Neofluar 40×/1.30 oil M27 objective (Carl Zeiss) at a 512 × 512 pixel resolution using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm and an emission wavelength of 673 nm. The different planes acquired were then projected on the same image and transformed in binary using Image J. The resulting number of chloroplasts per unit area and average chloroplast size was also measured using ImageJ.Gas Exchange Measurements, 14CO2 Feeding Experiments, and Analysis of Leaf 13C Discrimination Whole rosette photosynthesis and nighttime dark respiration were measured at 2–3 week intervals at 29, 49, 63, and 82 DAS. A custom-built rosette-gas-exchange chamber connected to a model no. LI-6400 portable gas exchange system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) was used to obtain photosynthesis and respiratory measurements. Conditions in the Arabidopsis rosette gas-exchange chamber during photosynthesis measurements were: a leaf temperature of 22°C; [CO2] of 400 μmol mol−1; and 120 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity. During night-time respiration measurements, the leaf temperature was maintained at 20°C. Flow rate was set at 500 μmol s−1 when making measurements from 49- and 63-d-old plants. For 29- and 82-d-old plants, flow rate was set at 300 and 700 μmol s−1, respectively, to better control humidity. After the initial measurements of photosynthesis, 29-d-old Arabidopsis rosettes were fed with 14CO2 for 10 min. After a 2-h chase period, leaf and root tissue were harvested separately into scintillation vials. Radioactivity was determined as disintegrations per min (DPM) by liquid scintillation counting. The DPM values recorded from roots and rosettes and the total DPM were used to calculate the proportion of C present in these organs. The content ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 in Arabidopsis freeze-dried leaf material was measured at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research, University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT), by mass spectrometry. These data were used to calculate the δ13CVPDB value, which is the 13C to 12C isotopic ratio of leaves relative to the 13C to 12C isotopic ratio of the Vienna-Pee-Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard (Farquhar et al., 1982). The δ13CVPDB values were used to calculate the CO2 partial pressure at Rubisco using Eq. 12 given in Farquhar et al. (1982). Values for the various factors are as follows: δ-value of CO2 in the air at present = −8.4‰ (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov); partial pressure of CO2 in the air = 39 Pa; 13C discrimination associated with the diffusion of CO2 through air = 4.4‰; and 13C discrimination in the carboxylation reaction = 27‰ (Farquhar et al., 1989).Analysis of Cell Wall Polysaccharides in Leaves Preparation of alcohol-insoluble residues and uronic acid and methyl ester assays were performed based on the methodology described in Kim et al. (2015). The matrix polysaccharide (hemicellulose) and crystalline cellulose composition, and soluble sugar content in leaves, were measured at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center Cell Wall Facility, Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI) as described in Kim et al. (2015).Parameterization of the Arabidopsis Leaf Area Growth Model Development, parameterization, and execution of the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model were described in detail in Weraduwage et al. (2015). This model is a tool to determine partitioning coefficients of C that could give rise to the growth patterns observed in different plants (Weraduwage et al., 2015). In the model, plant growth is divided into four growth stages: (1) heterotrophic phase (1–4 DAS); (2) early vegetative phase; (3) late vegetative phase; and the (4) reproductive phase. Ninety days of plant growth are simulated in the model using a fixed time step of 1 h and the photoperiod is set at 8 h. As described in detail in Weraduwage et al. (2015), the following were used as inputs of the model: weight of storage reserves, ratio of mobilized storage reserves to stored reserves, initial leaf area, initial leaf mass, projected to total leaf area ratio, net photosynthesis rate per unit leaf area, proportion of C stored as starch during the day, leaf maintenance and growth respiratory coefficients, photoperiod, and lengths of growth phases. Values for area-based photosynthesis obtained during the four harvests were fitted with a polynomial third-order equation to extrapolate area-based photosynthesis through the entire 90 d of the lifecycle. Similarly, measured projected to total leaf area ratios during the four harvests were fitted with a polynomial second-order equation to extrapolate the values over 90 d. These extrapolated values were used in the model as input photosynthesis values and projected to total leaf area ratios over the life span. The model also takes both growth and maintenance respiration into consideration. The model considers maintenance respiration of a plant/particular organ to be proportional to the corresponding dry mass and growth respiration to be proportional to the growth rate (Penning de Vries et al., 1974; Amthor, 1984; Thomas et al., 1993; Lambers et al., 2008). The model has set values for maintenance coefficients (amount of C respired to maintain the existing mass of the plant or specific organ, μmol C g−1 s−1), and for growth coefficients (amount of C respired per unit increase in mass, g g−1) based on values provided in the literature (Amthor, 1984; Mariko, 1988) and assumes that growth respiration coefficients of leaf growth in terms of area and LMA are the same throughout the lifecycle. The net amount of C available for growth and maintenance processes of the plant is determined as the product of area-based photosynthetic rate and the projected leaf area. Next, C consumed in maintenance respiration and exudation is subtracted to determine the net assimilation rate, which provides the amount of C available for growth. The model then simulates the partitioning of C available for growth to leaf area growth, growth in terms of LMA, and root and inflorescence growth based on the set partitioning coefficients that are adjustable to facilitate fitting of the data. Partitioning coefficients vary based on the growth phases. The increase in mass during growth in terms of leaf area and LMA, and root and inflorescence growth, is calculated by subtracting the C consumed in growth respiration from the total C allocated for growth of that particular organ. Accordingly, the model simulates the increase in leaf area and mass, and the mass of the inflorescence and roots. The model calculated SLA, LMA, and leaf, root, and inflorescence mass ratios over time based on the equations given above. To fit the modeled data to measured data, 16 partitioning coefficient parameters (partitioning to the inflorescence, roots, leaf area and LMA, for each of the four growth phases: germination phase, early and late vegetative phases, and reproductive phase) were adjusted so that the modeled and measured leaf area, mass of inflorescence, root, and leaf matched (Weraduwage et al., 2015). C partitioning data obtained by feeding Arabidopsis rosettes at 29 DAS with 14CO2 were used as initial estimates that were fine-tuned to fit the data. Sensitivity of the model to changes in the inputs was tested in Col-0 by simulating an increase or decrease of 1% in C partitioned to growth processes, and other model inputs, and noting the resulting response in output. The model was considered sensitive, in cases where more than 1% variation occurred in model outputs because of changing a particular input.Statistical Analyses of Experimental Data Four to five biological replicates per line were used to collect experimental data at a given time point. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). The effects of altered CGR2 and CGR3 expression on plant growth and gas exchange were compared using a univariate general linear model and the differences between means were tested by subjecting data to one-way ANOVA at α = 0.05, followed by a Fisher’s Least Significant Difference Test. Measured data presented in figures represent the mean ± standard error (SE).Accession Numbers Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers At3g49720 and At5g65810.Supplemental Data The following supplemental materials are available.

    "abstract": "Significance Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a small gene family that encodes proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational manipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from important crop plants.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Detailed information on the materials and methods used in this study is provided in SI Appendix. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. All mutants used in this study were derived from A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0). Plants were grown on soil or on Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) growth medium in either broad-spectrum white light or far-red light in controlled-environment chambers. The far-red block of greening experiments were adapted from Barnes et al. (15). Analysis of Chlorophylls. Chlorophylls were extracted using N,N′-dimethylformamide and quantified by spectrophotometry. Analysis of Chloroplasts by Microscopy. Chloroplasts were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Chlorophyll fluorescence, DF, and Λ were calculated from maximum-intensity projection images built from Z-stack images. The chloroplast number per cell plan area, chloroplast plan area, and chloroplast coverage were quantified as described previously (3). Construction, Expression, and Imaging of the REC1-YFP Fusion Gene. The ORF that encodes YFP was fused in-frame and downstream of an ORF that encodes the full-length REC1. Transient expression of REC1-YFP in Nicotiana tabacum was performed by infiltrating amitrole-treated or untreated leaves with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the REC1-YFP fusion gene. The imaging of YFP fluorescence was performed using confocal laser scanning confocal microscopes. Analysis of Whole-Seedling Extracts, Nuclear Fractions, and Cytosolic Fractions. Seedlings were grown on LS medium containing no sucrose or on the same medium containing 1% sucrose and an herbicide. Whole-seedling extracts were prepared by boiling frozen and powdered seedlings in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and then clarifying these extracts by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Nuclei were purified from seedlings using Percoll step gradients. Cytosolic fractions were the supernatants that were obtained by lysing purified protoplasts and then clarifying these lysates by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting.",
    "results": "Results Cloning and Characterizing rec1-1. We obtained one mutant allele of REC1 that we named rec1-1 from a screen for genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants (12). gun alleles disrupt the plastid-to-nucleus signaling that down-regulates photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene (PhANG) expression when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked. Thus, gun mutants express higher levels of PhANGs than wild type when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked (8). In addition to a gun phenotype, rec1-1 greens after seedlings are grown in far-red light and then transferred to white light (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). When wild-type seedlings are grown in far-red light, they overaccumulate the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide. In white light, these elevated levels of protochlorophyllide block chloroplast biogenesis by inducing increases in the levels of singlet oxygen (14, 15). We mapped this greening phenotype to a 70-kb interval near the top of chromosome 1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). We sequenced seven genes in this interval. We found a C-to-T transition that causes a nonsense mutation in the codon that encodes Q1415 of At1g01320 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). At1g01320 encodes a protein of unknown function with a calculated mass of 200 kDa. This protein contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and 106 residues near the carboxyl terminus that are 29% proline (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). TPRs contribute to the protein–protein interactions that underpin diverse biological processes (16). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll phenotypes of rec1 mutants. (A) The far-red block of greening phenotype of four rec1 mutants. A far-red block of greening experiment was performed as described in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods. The proportions of seedlings that greened are indicated (n = 188–234; numbers were pooled from two biological replicates). The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001). (B) Chlorophyll phenotypes of rec1 mutants. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Six biological replicates were analyzed for wild type (Col-0) and each mutant. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001).We obtained three publicly available T-DNA insertion mutants with insertions in At1g01320. We named these T-DNA insertion alleles rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4. We found reduced levels of mRNA transcribed from At1g01320 in all of these mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). We also analyzed these mutants by immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies raised against fragments of the protein encoded by At1g01320 that spanned from P1419 to F1673 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). When whole-leaf extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting, these antibodies recognized a single band in an extract that was prepared from wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Based on the mobility of this protein in a 5% SDS gel (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D), we estimated that its mass is 240 kDa. This 240-kDa protein does not accumulate to detectable levels in rec1-1, rec1-2, rec1-3, or rec1-4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C). We found that, similar to the rec1-1 allele, the three T-DNA insertion alleles inhibited the far-red block of greening (Fig. 1A). We found that the chlorophyll levels in rec1-1 were 71% of wild type. In contrast, we found that the chlorophyll levels of rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 were 57–58% of wild type (Fig. 1B) and 81–82% of rec1-1 (P = 0.001–0.006). We conclude that rec1-1 attenuated the accumulation of chlorophyll and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 are null alleles. These data are consistent with rec1-1 expressing a truncated protein that promotes the accumulation of chlorophyll. We were not able to detect such a truncated protein because our antibodies bind residues that are carboxyl-terminal to Q1415. To test whether the three T-DNA insertion mutants are gun mutants, we grew them on media that contained either norflurazon or lincomycin. Norflurazon and lincomycin specifically block chloroplast biogenesis by distinct mechanisms and severely down-regulate the expression of PhANGs, such as the genes encoding the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of photosystem II (Lhcb) and the small subunit of RuBisCO (RbcS) (8). We found that rec1-1 accumulated 3.2- to 4.3-fold more Lhcb1.2 than wild type and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly more Lhcb1.2 mRNA than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). However, rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly less Lhcb1.2 mRNA than rec1-1 (P < 0.0001–0.009) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). We observed a similar trend with RbcS1A expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In contrast, gun1-101 (12), a null allele of a relatively well studied GUN gene (8), induced 13- and 35-fold increases in Lhcb1.2 expression when chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with norflurazon and lincomycin treatments, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These data provide evidence that norflurazon treatments activate a repressive plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanism that is not activated by lincomycin treatments or that an inductive mechanism present in lincomycin-treated seedlings is absent in norflurazon-treated seedlings. In untreated seedlings, Lhcb1.2 mRNA accumulated to significantly lower levels in rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 than in wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), which is consistent with the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of these mutants (Fig. 1B). The levels of RbcS1A mRNA were not significantly different in the untreated wild type and rec1 mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Based on these data, we conclude that these rec1 alleles specifically disrupted the plastid-regulated expression of these PhANGs and that At1g01320 is REC1. Our characterization of these rec1 alleles indicates that rec1-1 behaves as a loss-of-function allele when the far-red block of greening and the chlorophyll accumulation phenotypes are scored and that rec1-1 enhances the levels of PhANG expression relative to other mutant alleles of REC1 when the gun phenotype is scored. A truncated REC1 protein that is partially active may underpin these phenotypes. There is precedence for mutant alleles causing both loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes (17, 18). Characterization of the REC Gene Family Mutants. The REC1 protein is homologous to three other Arabidopsis proteins that are encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and FRIENDLY (At3g52140) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The proteins encoded by At4g28080 and At1g15290 have no known function. Loss-of-function alleles of FRIENDLY and its orthologs in Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster cause mitochondrial clustering (19). FRIENDLY and orthologous proteins were reported to perform a variety of functions, such as binding and regulating atypical protein kinase C (20), binding mRNAs that encode mitochondrial proteins and promoting the biogenesis of mitochondria (21), and promoting intermitochondrial associations before mitochondrial fusion (13). The calculated masses of the proteins that are encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and FRIENDLY are 200 kDa, 180 kDa, and 150 kDa, respectively. We named At4g28080 and At1g15290 REC2 and REC3, respectively, based on their derived amino acid sequence similarity to REC1. REC1 is more similar to REC2 and REC3 than to FRIENDLY (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Homologs of REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY are present in other plant species (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In contrast, eukaryotes that do not perform photosynthesis contain only orthologs of FRIENDLY, usually as a single-copy gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). To test whether REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY contribute to the same or different processes as REC1, we obtained T-DNA insertion alleles for each of these genes. We found that T-DNA insertions reduced the levels of mRNA transcribed from these genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In REC3 mutants, the low levels of mRNA are not expected to encode functional proteins because the insertions are in exons. In REC2 and FRIENDLY mutants, the reduced levels of mRNA might express truncated proteins that are not functional. Indeed, three independent T-DNA insertions into REC2 caused chlorophyll to accumulate at significantly lower levels than in wild type, and these reduced levels of chlorophyll were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.3–0.6) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). We conclude that these three alleles are nulls. Based on the robust mitochondrial clustering phenotype of the T-DNA insertion allele of FRIENDLY (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B), we conclude that this allele is either a null or a strong loss-of-function allele. To determine the full impact of these four genes on chloroplast-related processes, we prepared double, triple, and quadruple mutants with rec1-3, rec2, rec3-1, and friendly in all possible combinations. We found that rec2, rec3-1, rec3-2, and friendly exhibited a far-red block of greening that was more similar to wild type than to rec1-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). We found that after 3 d of growth in far-red light, protochlorophyllide accumulated to significantly lower levels in rec1-3 than in wild type, protochlorophyllide accumulated to significantly higher levels in friendly than in wild type, and protochlorophyllide levels were not significantly different from wild type in rec2 and rec3-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). Significantly less protochlorophyllide accumulated in double and triple mutants containing rec1-3 and the quadruple mutants relative to the relevant single, double, and triple mutants (P < 0.0001–0.005). Significantly more protochlorophyllide accumulated in rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec2 friendly, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly than in rec3-1, rec1-3 rec3-1, rec1-3 rec2, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, respectively (P = 0.0003–0.02). We conclude that mutant alleles of REC1 inhibit the far-red block of greening by reducing the levels of protochlorophyllide. Attenuating phytochrome A signaling inhibits the far-red block of greening (15). Perhaps the simplest way to test for defects in phytochrome A signaling is to measure hypocotyl lengths in far-red light. We found that, in the dark, the lengths of the rec1-3 hypocotyls were not significantly different from wild type but that those of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were 11% shorter (SI Appendix, Fig. S8C). However, we found that in 3 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 far-red light, the hypocotyls of rec1-3 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were not significantly different from wild type (P = 0.4–0.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D). We conclude that the inhibition of the far-red block of greening in rec1 mutants is probably not caused by defects in phytochrome A signaling. We found that when chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with a lincomycin treatment, Lhcb1.2 expression in rec2 and rec3-1 was 69% and 68% of the levels observed in wild type, respectively. In friendly, RbcS1A expression was increased 1.5-fold but Lhcb1.2 expression was not significantly different from wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Double and triple mutants containing rec1-3 and friendly tended to exhibit gun phenotypes, as did the quadruple mutant, whereas the double and triple mutants containing rec2 and rec3-1 generally did not exhibit gun phenotypes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). The most robust gun phenotype was observed for rec1-3 rec2 friendly, which accumulated 3.3- and 2.2-fold more mRNA from Lhcb1.2 and RbcS1A, respectively, than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Thus, this gene family makes significant but minor contributions to the plastid regulation of these PhANGs relative to GUN1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). REC gene family mutants appear chlorophyll-deficient (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). These chlorophyll deficiencies ranged from uniform chlorophyll deficiencies to virescence in rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). We quantified the chlorophyll levels of these mutants and found that rec1-3 and rec2 accumulated 63% and 81% of the chlorophyll found in wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In several instances, combinations of these alleles enhanced the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of rec1-3 and rec2. The most extreme examples were rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, which accumulated 31%, 21%, and 16% of the chlorophyll found in wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast to rec1-3 and rec2, there was no significant difference in the levels of chlorophyll that accumulated in rec3-1, friendly, rec3-1 friendly, and wild type (P = 0.2–0.8) (Fig. 2). Additionally, rec3-1 and friendly did not affect the accumulation of chlorophyll in rec1-3 friendly, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.1–0.9) (Fig. 2). However, rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3 and rec1-3 rec2 (P < 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, rec3-1 attenuated the accumulation of chlorophyll in particular genetic contexts. Additionally, rec1-3 rec2 friendly accumulated significantly more chlorophyll than rec1-3 rec2 (P = 0.0004) and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2). Thus, the effect of friendly on the accumulation of chlorophyll depended on the genetic context. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll levels in the REC gene family mutants. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Six biological replicates were analyzed for wild type (Col-0) and each mutant. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (P < 0.0001–0.0003).The chloroplast ultrastructure in many of the mutants resembled wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). The chloroplast ultrastructures of chlorophyll-deficient mutants typically resemble wild type (22, 23). The most severely chlorophyll-deficient mutants (Fig. 2) tended to have long and thin chloroplasts relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). Similar phenotypes were not reported for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis mutants, such as the severely chlorophyll-deficient gun4 hy1 and gun5 hy1 double mutants (22). Holes were observed in the chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 that were surrounded by double membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). These holes probably resulted from the sectioning of cytosolic protrusions into the chloroplasts that do not disrupt the chloroplast double membrane. Consistent with this interpretation, a mitochondrion was found in one of these holes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). The grana thylakoids of the mutants appeared similar to wild type, but rec1 rec2 rec3-1 contained fewer grana thylakoids than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). A reduction in the number of grana thylakoids is not commonly observed in Arabidopsis mutants unless the chlorophyll deficiencies are severe (22–24). The thylakoid membranes appeared swollen in four friendly mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S14) and similar to wild type in the other friendly mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Swelling of the thylakoid membranes was not reported previously for friendly mutants (13, 25). These data are consistent with complex interactions among these alleles affecting the ability of the thylakoid membranes to withstand osmotic pressure (26). To further characterize the chloroplast defects of these mutants, we imaged the chloroplasts in live cells from the abaxial epidermal cells to the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll cells in leaves using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found a number of differences relative to wild type. These differences included a tendency of the chloroplasts to localize along the anticlinal walls of mesophyll cells, enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence in both the mesophyll and epidermal cells, and fewer chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells in particular triple mutants and the quadruple mutant (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S15). The chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells residing along the anticlinal walls and the increases in chlorophyll fluorescence are consistent with increased sensitivity to light (27, 28). To test whether a potentially enhanced sensitivity to light led to a rise in the levels of reactive oxygen species, we stained leaves with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) to detect hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively. These mutants appear to accumulate variable levels of reactive oxygen species (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Live-cell imaging analysis of the chloroplasts from the REC gene family mutants. (A) Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of chloroplasts from the REC gene family mutants, cch, and gun4-1. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Each representative image was obtained by Z stacking 20 images from the abaxial surface of the leaf beginning in the epidermis and ending in the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll. (Scale bar, 20 μm.) (B) Fractal dimensions of the REC gene family mutants. Values of DF were calculated from five to seven representative images to compare the geometric complexity of the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant. Plant growth was as in A. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001–0.045). (C) Lacunarity parameters of the REC gene family mutants. Values of Λ were calculated from five to seven representative images to compare the gaps in the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant. Plant growth, error bars, and asterisk definition were as in B (P < 0.0001–0.02).The chlorophyll biosynthesis mutants cch and gun4-1 (29, 30) were analyzed to test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might cause similar phenotypes. cch and gun4-1 were previously reported to accumulate only 30–40% of the chlorophyll found in wild type (30). Similar to the REC gene family mutants, the chloroplasts of cch and gun4-1 appeared along the anticlinal walls in mesophyll cells (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with the enhanced sensitivities of chlorophyll-deficient mutants to light (31). cch exhibited enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence relative to gun4-1 and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S15). Thus, chlorophyll deficiencies were not correlated with increases in chlorophyll fluorescence. The distribution of chloroplasts within the mesophyll cells in many of these mutants appeared to differ from wild type (Fig. 3A). To quantify these differences, we calculated a fractal dimension (DF) and a lacunarity parameter (Λ) for each image (32). Calculating DF allowed us to compare the geometric complexity of the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant (32). Calculating Λ allowed us to compare the heterogeneity (e.g., the gaps) in the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant (32). Significant differences in the value of the DF were observed in nine of these mutants (Fig. 3B). The values for DF were not significantly different from wild type in rec1-3, rec1-3 rec3-1, and mutants containing both rec3-1 and friendly, namely rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly (Fig. 3B). In contrast to other mutants containing both rec3-1 and friendly, the DF of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly was significantly less than wild type (Fig. 3B). This difference may reflect the decrease in the number of the chloroplasts in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly relative to other mutants that contain both rec3-1 and friendly (Fig. 3A). Chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the differences in geometric complexities of these images because although the DF values of the images from cch were significantly less than wild type, the DF values of the images from gun4-1 were not significantly different from wild type (Fig. 3B). Λ was significantly reduced in all of the mutants except rec2 and rec1-3 rec3-1 (Fig. 3C). Although Λ was significantly less in gun4-1 than in wild type, Λ was not significantly different between cch and wild type (Fig. 3C). Based on these data, we conclude that significant differences in the gaps of the chloroplast networks of the rec and friendly mutants were not caused by chlorophyll deficiencies. Our analysis of DF and Λ provides evidence that the rec alleles, friendly, and combinations of the rec and friendly alleles affect the distribution of chloroplasts. Differences in the numbers, sizes, and shapes of these chloroplasts may account for some of these differences in DF and Λ. Mutants with abnormal distributions of chloroplasts often exhibit abnormal chloroplast movements because of deficiencies in the machinery that helps chloroplasts track along the cytoskeleton. Abnormal chloroplast movements are readily detected with chloroplast photorelocation experiments (27). We found that chloroplast photorelocation was indistinguishable between rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S17 and Movies S1 and S2). We also imaged stromules by targeting yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the plastids because the number of stromules is reduced when the association of stromules and the cytoskeleton is disrupted (33). We observed no significant differences in the appearance or number of stromules in wild type, rec1-3, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.1–0.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S18). To quantify the reduced chloroplast compartment size phenotypes that we observed in live cells from the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll, we fixed leaf sections with glutaraldehyde and quantified the plan areas of fixed mesophyll cells and their chloroplasts (3). In the mutants, the size of the chloroplast compartment in the glutaraldehyde-fixed cells appeared reduced relative to wild type, especially in particular triple mutants and the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4A). The number of chloroplasts was correlated with the mesophyll cell plan area in each mutant and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S19). This correlation was previously demonstrated for wild type (2, 3, 7). We found that in many of the mutants, the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area was reduced relative to wild type. The greatest reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area were 44–62%, observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 friendly, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S19). The reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area exhibited by rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (24–25%) were significantly greater than in the relevant single mutants (P < 0.0001–0.03) (Fig. 4B). Without rec1-3, combinations of rec2, rec3-1, and friendly did not significantly decrease the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area. In most instances, friendly did not significantly affect the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area (P = 0.0714–0.9198). However, a significant increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area was observed in rec2 rec3-1 friendly relative to rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.0003). Based on these data, we conclude that rec1-3 attenuates the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area more than the other mutant alleles tested and that friendly promotes the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area in a specific genetic context.

A log transformation of the percent chloroplast coverage is presented. Error bars represent SEM. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001–0.02).The mutants with no or small (15–25%) reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area also exhibited small (7–14%) reductions in chloroplast plan area relative to wild type (Fig. 4C). The largest reduction in chloroplast plan area was 22% observed in rec2 rec3-1 friendly. However, rec2 rec3-1 friendly was unusual relative to the other mutants tested in that it also exhibited a 17% increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area relative to wild type (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the other mutants, the three most chlorophyll-deficient REC gene family mutants (rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly; Fig. 2) exhibited 31–46% increases in their chloroplast plan areas relative to wild type (Fig. 4C). The increases in chloroplast plan area observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly are small compared with the 500% to ∼2,000% enlargements in chloroplast plan area that were reported for chloroplast division mutants (2, 5, 34). These findings are consistent with the idea that rec and friendly alleles disrupt mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division rather than those that perform chloroplast division. Numerous signals appear to regulate chloroplast division (2). Consistent with the observed large reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and either no increases or small increases in chloroplast plan area, we found that chloroplast coverage (total chloroplast plan area per cell plan area) was significantly reduced in many of the mutants compared with wild type (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S20). Moreover, we observed a significant interaction between the presence of rec1-3 and the number of mutant alleles (P < 0.00001). In the presence of rec1-3, chloroplast coverage fell as the number of mutant alleles increased (Fig. 4D). The greatest reduction in chloroplast coverage (50%) was observed in the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4D). In contrast, when plants contained REC1, adding further mutant alleles did not significantly reduce chloroplast coverage, regardless of the number of mutant alleles present (Fig. 4D). Normalizing chlorophyll levels (Fig. 2) to chloroplast coverage (Fig. 4D) indicates that the chloroplasts of friendly accumulated significantly more chlorophyll than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). This analysis also indicates that the reduced chloroplast coverage phenotypes explain the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes in rec2, rec2 rec3-1, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly and the differences between the severely chlorophyll-deficient mutants rec1-3 rec2 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 and between rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). However, normalizing chlorophyll levels to chloroplast coverage does not explain the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of rec1-3, the double and triple mutants that contain rec1-3, or the quadruple mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). Thus, rec1-3 attenuates both chloroplast coverage and the accumulation of chlorophyll. To test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might contribute to these chloroplast coverage phenotypes, we analyzed glutaraldehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, gun4-1, and cch grown in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light rather than the 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light that was used for the previous experiments. Reducing the irradiance increases chlorophyll levels in chlorophyll-deficient mutants (31). When grown in 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light, the individual chloroplasts of cch were difficult to distinguish by differential interference contrast microscopy. We also analyzed the glutaraldehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from four mutants grown in 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light: the plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutant gun1-101 (12) and the chlorophyll-deficient and photomorphogenic mutants constitutive photomorphogenic 1-4 (cop1-4), de-etiolated 1-1 (det1-1), and phytochrome A phytochrome B double mutant (phyA phyB) (35). We found that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly accumulated more than twofold higher levels of chlorophyll in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light relative to 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 C and D) and that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB were chlorophyll-deficient relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Figs. S22 C and D, S23 A, D, and E, S24, and S25 C and D). The average number of chloroplasts per cell plan area decreased and the average chloroplast plan area increased in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and wild type in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light relative to 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 A, E, and F). We observed a variety of significant differences in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and chloroplast plan area phenotypes of gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 B, D, F, and G and S25 A, B, E, and F). The more than twofold increase in chlorophyll levels did not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 B and G). Chloroplast coverage was not significantly different from wild type in gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, or phyA phyB (P = 0.7–1.0) (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 C, D, and H and S25 B and G). The number of chloroplasts per cell plan area, chloroplast plan area, and chloroplast coverage phenotypes of gun1-101 were not significantly different from wild type (P = 0.6–0.8) (SI Appendix, Fig. S26). We conclude that both the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and chloroplast plan area are probably controlled by a number of mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division, and that these signals include light signaling and signals induced by chlorophyll deficiencies. Chlorophyll deficiencies do not completely explain these phenotypes because, although the chloroplast plan areas were larger than wild type in cop1-4, det1-1, phyA phyB, rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the chloroplast plan areas were smaller than wild type in cch and gun4-1. Additionally, we conclude that, in general, altering light-regulated development and significantly attenuating the accumulation of chlorophyll do not affect chloroplast coverage in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells. We also conclude that chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the reduced chloroplast coverage phenotypes of the rec mutants. We found that two components of the chloroplast division machinery—filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ)1-1 and FtsZ2-1—accumulated to lower levels in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly than in wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S27). Reducing the levels of FtsZ1-1 and FtsZ2-1 inhibits chloroplast division but does not affect chloroplast coverage (36). Any number of signals may down-regulate the expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. The reduced expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 may partially explain the enlarged chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. To test whether the levels of the REC1 protein limit the size of the chloroplast compartment, we used the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus to drive the overexpression of REC1 in sgs3 rdr6-11—a double mutant that is resistant to transgene-induced gene silencing (37). We found three independent transgenic lines that accumulated more REC1 protein than sgs3 rdr6-11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S28). Chloroplast coverage increased from 11% to 17% in the transgenic lines that accumulated elevated levels of REC1 (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S29). In lines 40 and 66, the increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to result mostly from an increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area without a significant change in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts (Fig. 5B). However, plots of total chloroplast plan area and chloroplast number versus cell plan area provide evidence for heterogeneity in the organellar basis for the increase in chloroplast coverage for line 40 (SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the attenuation of chloroplast division in some of the larger cells from line 40. In line 44, the increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to result from an increase in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts and no change in the number of chloroplasts per cell (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the misregulation of chloroplast division in this particular transgenic plant.

Error bars and asterisk definition are as in C (P < 0.0001). Subcellular Distribution of REC1. To gain insight into the mechanism that underpins the biological functions of REC1, we determined the subcellular distribution of REC1 by fusing YFP to the carboxyl terminus of REC1, transiently expressing the REC1-YFP fusion protein in tobacco leaves and monitoring the subcellular distribution of REC1-YFP by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To test whether REC1-YFP was transiently expressed as a full-length protein, we analyzed leaf sections expressing REC1-YFP by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoblotting analysis indicates that REC1-YFP accumulates as a single band (SI Appendix, Fig. S30A) and that the mass of REC1-YFP is greater than the mass of native REC1 (SI Appendix, Figs. S3D and S30B). Live-cell confocal microscopy analyses with settings that distinguish GFP, YFP, and chlorophylls (38) show REC1-YFP in the nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 6A). The nucleus is recognizable by the appearance of the nucleolus (Fig. 6A, arrow) and by the localization of ssGFP-HDEL, an endoplasmic reticulum marker that defines the nuclear envelope (39) (Fig. 6B). We found that REC1-YFP is excluded from chloroplasts (Fig. 6 C and D). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Subcellular distribution of REC1-YFP in herbicide-treated and untreated leaf cells. Micrographs of untreated tobacco cells (A–D) and amitrole-treated tobacco cells (E–H): REC1-YFP (A and E), HDEL-GFP (B and F), chlorophyll fluorescence (C and G), and merged images (D and H). (Scale bars, 10 μm.) (I) Representative tobacco plant 10 d after amitrole treatment. The red arrow indicates the leaf infiltrated with amitrole. The blue arrow indicates the site of coinfiltration with REC1-YFP and HDEL-GFP.To test whether the functional state of the chloroplast might affect the subcellular distribution of REC1, we infiltrated one leaf of a tobacco plant with amitrole, an herbicide that causes chlorophyll deficiencies (40). We found that amitrole caused observable chlorophyll deficiencies in leaves that developed from shoot apical meristems after infiltrations (Fig. 6I). We suggest that amitrole moved from the sites of infiltrations to the shoot apical meristem, where it attenuated the chloroplast biogenesis that occurred during leaf development. In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, chloroplasts were significantly smaller than in untreated leaves (Fig. 6 C and G). In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, REC1-YFP localized to the cytosol and was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 6 E–H). We tested whether REC1 was enriched in nuclear and cytosolic fractions prepared from Arabidopsis seedlings. The enrichment of histone H3 and UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively, indicates that nuclei and cytosols were enriched in these preparations (Fig. 7A). Using affinity-purified anti-REC1 antibodies (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), we found that REC1 was enriched in these nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 7A). Although these anti-REC1 antibodies recognized multiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, they recognized only one band in the whole-seedling extracts prepared using denaturing conditions (Fig. 7A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). We conclude that the affinity-purified anti-REC1 antibodies recognize multiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, because partial proteolysis of REC1 occurred during the purification of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. Next, we tested whether herbicides affect the levels of REC1 in purified nuclei. We found that REC1 was present at similar levels in nuclei regardless of whether nuclei were purified from untreated seedlings or seedlings that lacked functional chloroplasts because chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with a norflurazon treatment (Fig. 7 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S31A). When chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with an amitrole treatment, much longer exposures of immunoblots than used to detect REC1 in the nuclear fractions from norflurazon-treated and untreated seedlings provided evidence that only trace quantities of REC1 accumulated in nuclei purified from amitrole-treated seedlings (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix, Fig. S31A). Methyl viologen induces a rise in the levels of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species that causes chloroplast dysfunction and activates the plastid-to-nucleus signaling that induces the expression of nuclear genes, such as the nuclear genes that encode cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (41). To test whether chloroplastic reactive oxygen species affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1, we transferred 5-d-old seedlings to a growth medium that contained 1 μM methyl viologen and allowed the seedlings to grow for an additional 3 d. Higher levels of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase and lower levels of chlorophyll accumulated in the methyl viologen-treated seedlings than in untreated seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig. S31 B–D). We conclude that this methyl viologen treatment induced chloroplast dysfunction and the expression of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, probably by inducing a rise in the levels of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species. We found that REC1 accumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of methyl viologen-treated and untreated seedlings (Fig. 7C). In addition to inhibiting chloroplast function, amitrole inhibits root elongation (40), which depends on cell division and cell elongation (42). To test whether inhibiting cell expansion might drive REC1 out of the nucleus, we tested whether REC1 accumulates in the nuclei of the Arabidopsis null mutant rhd3-7 (43). rhd3-7 and other RHD3 mutants are smaller than wild type because cell expansion is inhibited in these mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S31A) (43, 44). We found that REC1 accumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of rhd3-7 and wild type (Fig. 7D). We conclude that amitrole treatments specifically exclude REC1 from the nucleus. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Subcellular distribution of REC1 in herbicide-treated and untreated seedlings. (A) Subcellular distribution of REC1 in untreated seedlings. Whole-seedling extracts (WSE), nuclear fractions (NF), and cytosolic fractions (CF) were prepared from 8-d-old seedlings that were grown on LS medium that lacked an herbicide.

    "discussion": "Discussion Our phenotypic characterizations provide evidence that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family link increases in mesophyll cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment size. Other than the proteins encoded by the REC gene family, there are no candidates for proteins that contribute to this mechanism (2, 6, 45). Cells of the shoot apical meristem contain fewer than 10 proplastids. After chloroplast biogenesis and during the mesophyll cell expansion that occurs during leaf development, there is a large increase in the number of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells (45). The mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly contained 22 ± 8 chloroplasts (SI Appendix, Figs. S19 and S22A). Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment is partially active in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. A few models are consistent with these data. One possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family directly contribute to the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment and that this mechanism retains partial activity in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. Another possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family regulate a mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. A third possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family contribute to a mechanism that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and a distinct mechanism that does not require the REC genes independently contributes to the size of the chloroplast compartment. Further study of the REC genes may lead to the ability to rationally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment and to the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, which is anticipated to increase yields from important crops, such as rice (9, 11). The contribution of the REC genes to the distribution of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells may also contribute to the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, because the distribution of chloroplasts within mesophyll cells differs between C3 and C4 plants (11). The rec and friendly mutants appear deficient in a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanisms that are deficient in other chloroplast distribution mutants because in contrast to the normal photorelocation observed in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the photorelocation of chloroplasts is abnormal in other chloroplast distribution mutants (27). In contrast to the rec2, rec3, and friendly alleles that we tested, rec1-3 reduces the accumulation of chlorophyll. This observation raised the possibility that the chlorophyll deficiencies of the rec1 mutants might prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with a mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. Indeed, in crumpled leaf (crl) and clumped chloroplasts 1 (clmp1), chloroplasts do not keep pace with this mechanism because chloroplasts are not equally distributed between daughter cells during cell division (46, 47). Our finding that inducing an increase in the levels of chlorophyll does not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and that chloroplast coverage is not significantly different from wild type in the chlorophyll-deficient mutants cch, gun4-1, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates that chlorophyll deficiencies do not prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. Chlorophyll deficiency is a common phenotype in Arabidopsis. Thus, disrupting any number of chloroplast functions may indirectly affect the thylakoid membranes. Indeed, disrupting mechanisms that drive chloroplast division and mechanisms that potentially regulate chloroplast division appears to indirectly affect the normal development of the thylakoid membranes (34, 48, 49) and the accumulation of chlorophyll (47, 50, 51). The screening of 3,500 ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutants for plants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage (3), was not sufficient to saturate this screen (52). Nonetheless, screening ∼2,000 EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis plants is usually sufficient for isolating specific mutants (53). Indeed, the screen of Pyke and Leech (3) yielded more than 10 different genes that, in most instances, encode proteins that directly contribute to chloroplast division (2). An additional screen of 10,000 EMS mutants for plants with enlarged chloroplasts yielded only one additional gene that directly contributes to chloroplast division (54). Additionally, a screen of 5,200 Arabidopsis mutants that were homozygous for T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes that mostly encode chloroplast proteins for mutants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage, yielded one chloroplast division mutant and no chloroplast coverage mutants (46). These data and our finding that chloroplast coverage is not different from wild type in cch, gun4-1, gun1-101, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicate that a reduction in the size of the chloroplast compartment is not a common phenotype. We suggest that the REC genes may directly contribute to a mechanism that links increases in the size of the chloroplast compartment to increases in the size of mesophyll cells because reduced chloroplast coverage is not a common phenotype and because overexpressing REC1 induces significant increases in chloroplast coverage. Our finding that the REC1 protein resides in the cytosol and nucleus further supports the idea that REC1 helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment because this mechanism is expected to reside in an extraplastidic compartment. A less than twofold increase in chloroplast coverage was observed in the fully expanded leaves and mature green fruits of the high pigment 1 (hp-1) mutant of tomato (55). HP-1 encodes UV-damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) (56). DDB1 interacts with DET1, a master repressor of light-regulated development that contributes to ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated protein degradation (35). Our analysis of cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates that defects in light-regulated development do not necessarily affect the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells. The biochemical functions of REC1, REC2, and REC3 are not known. FRIENDLY appears to perform a variety of functions (13, 20, 21). The indistinguishable photorelocation of chloroplasts that we observed in wild type and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and the localization of REC1 to both the cytosol and the nucleus conflict with the idea that REC proteins directly contribute to the tracking of chloroplasts along the cytoskeleton. Similarly, mitochondrial clustering in friendly does not result from a cytoskeletal or motor defect (13). The enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplasts aligning along the anticlinal walls, abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure, and chlorophyll deficiencies in the rec and friendly mutants indicate that these mutant alleles induce chloroplast dysfunction. REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY may contribute to processes in the cytosol and nucleus that promote the function of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Consistent with this interpretation, FRIENDLY was localized to the cytosol, and mutations in FRIENDLY and the Drosophila ortholog of FRIENDLY induce metabolic dysfunction (13, 57). The finding that REC1 is excluded from the nucleus when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked or attenuated with an amitrole treatment is consistent with a plastid signaling mechanism that is activated by amitrole treatments regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. This inference follows because proteins larger than ∼40 kDa are actively transported across the nuclear envelope (58) and because the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of proteins contributes to a number of processes, including diverse signaling mechanisms (35, 58). The finding that, in contrast to amitrole treatments, norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments do not exclude REC1 from the nucleus is consistent with a plastid signaling mechanism that is activated by amitrole treatments but not activated by norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. Consistent with this interpretation, plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms appear numerous (8). Another possibility is that an extraplastidic mechanism that is inhibited by amitrole treatments might affect the subcellular distribution of REC1 because in contrast to norflurazon and methyl viologen (8, 59), amitrole is not a specific inhibitor of chloroplast function. Although amitrole inhibits plastidic processes, such as carotenoid biosynthesis and histidine biosynthesis, amitrole is more effective at inhibiting root elongation, which depends on cell division and cell elongation (40). Our findings that the REC genes link increases in cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment size and that amitrole specifically affects the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 are consistent with the inhibition of cell expansion regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. If the inhibition of cell expansion excludes REC1 from the nucleus, rhd3-7 may not affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 because rhd3-7 does not sufficiently inhibit cell expansion. Amitrole treatments may inhibit a process in the nucleus by excluding REC1 from the nucleus. Alternatively, amitrole-treated plants may attempt to stimulate a cytosolic process by driving REC1 into the cytosol. Another possibility is that REC1 performs the same function or different functions in the nucleus and the cytosol. In summary, we provide evidence that REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY promote the proper morphology, function, and size of the chloroplast compartment. These functions may depend on the trafficking of REC1 between the nucleus and the cytosol. Signals activated by the inhibition of cell expansion or chloroplast dysfunction may regulate this mechanism. Understanding the biochemical function of REC1 and the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 may lead to the rational manipulation of the size of the chloroplast compartment and higher yields from important crops.",

Significance Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a small gene family that encodes proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational manipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from important crop plants. Keywords: chloroplast coverage, chloroplast, plastid signaling, chlorophyll, ArabidopsisAbstract Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1. Chloroplasts drive plant growth, development, and reproduction by converting solar energy into biologically useful forms of energy. Thus, the biogenesis and function of chloroplasts underpin crop yields and, indeed, life on Earth. Chloroplasts develop from proplastids during germination and leaf development (1). After chloroplast biogenesis, chloroplasts divide by binary fission. A number of mutant alleles enhance or reduce the size of individual chloroplasts by attenuating or promoting chloroplast division (2). Regardless of the size of individual chloroplasts, the proportion of cellular volume devoted to all chloroplasts appears indistinguishable from wild type in these mutants (3–5). Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment appears distinct from the mechanisms of chloroplast division. The cell expansion that drives the expansion of leaves also drives the proliferation of chloroplasts. Indeed, the proliferation of chloroplasts is so tightly correlated with cell expansion that the ratio of the size of the chloroplast compartment to the size of mesophyll cells is constant, regardless of cell size (2, 6, 7). Cell type exerts a major influence over the proportion of cellular volume devoted to the chloroplast. For instance, the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells is larger than in epidermal cells. Thus, an extraplastidic mechanism appears to determine the size of the chloroplast compartment (6). However, during the expansion of leaves, chloroplasts are not completely submissive to the cell. Indeed, chloroplast dysfunction inhibits the expansion of leaves (8). Although mechanisms that establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles are of fundamental importance to biology, these mechanisms remain poorly understood (2). In the particular case of chloroplasts, understanding these mechanisms may lead to significant advances for agriculture. For example, introducing C4 photosynthesis into rice, a plant that performs C3 photosynthesis, is one strategy for potentially increasing yields from this important crop (9). C3 and C4 leaves are distinct at the metabolic, cellular, and anatomical levels (9, 10). One of the conserved features of C4 leaves is the increase and decrease in the size of the chloroplast compartment in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, respectively, relative to C3 leaves (10). The engineering of C4 photosynthesis in important C3 crops, such as rice, is thought to depend on the ability to rationally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment (11). We performed a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana (12). From this screen, we obtained one mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function. This gene is homologous to two Arabidopsis genes that encode proteins of unknown function and to FRIENDLY. FRIENDLY and its orthologs promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis and in nonphotosynthetic organisms (13). However, these three Arabidopsis homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we thought that FRIENDLY may have expanded into a small gene family to help manage the energy metabolism of cells that contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria. We tested this idea by examining the phenotypes of mutants in which one, two, three, or all four of these genes are knocked out. We found that these mutants exhibited a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a smaller chloroplast compartment relative to wild type. Thus, we named these genes REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). We also found that the protein that contributes most to establishing the size of the chloroplast compartment, REC1, localizes to both the nucleus and the cytosol, and we provide evidence that signals derived from dysfunctional chloroplasts or the inhibition of cell expansion may regulate the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1. Results Cloning and Characterizing rec1-1. We obtained one mutant allele of REC1 that we named rec1-1 from a screen for genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants (12). gun alleles disrupt the plastid-to-nucleus signaling that down-regulates photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene (PhANG) expression when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked. Thus, gun mutants express higher levels of PhANGs than wild type when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked (8). In addition to a gun phenotype, rec1-1 greens after seedlings are grown in far-red light and then transferred to white light (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). When wild-type seedlings are grown in far-red light, they overaccumulate the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide. In white light, these elevated levels of protochlorophyllide block chloroplast biogenesis by inducing increases in the levels of singlet oxygen (14, 15). We mapped this greening phenotype to a 70-kb interval near the top of chromosome 1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). We sequenced seven genes in this interval. We found a C-to-T transition that causes a nonsense mutation in the codon that encodes Q1415 of At1g01320 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). At1g01320 encodes a protein of unknown function with a calculated mass of 200 kDa. This protein contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and 106 residues near the carboxyl terminus that are 29% proline (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). TPRs contribute to the protein–protein interactions that underpin diverse biological processes (16). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll phenotypes of rec1 mutants. (A) The far-red block of greening phenotype of four rec1 mutants. A far-red block of greening experiment was performed as described in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods. The proportions of seedlings that greened are indicated (n = 188–234; numbers were pooled from two biological replicates). The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001). (B) Chlorophyll phenotypes of rec1 mutants. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Six biological replicates were analyzed for wild type (Col-0) and each mutant. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001).We obtained three publicly available T-DNA insertion mutants with insertions in At1g01320. We named these T-DNA insertion alleles rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4. We found reduced levels of mRNA transcribed from At1g01320 in all of these mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). We also analyzed these mutants by immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies raised against fragments of the protein encoded by At1g01320 that spanned from P1419 to F1673 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). When whole-leaf extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting, these antibodies recognized a single band in an extract that was prepared from wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Based on the mobility of this protein in a 5% SDS gel (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D), we estimated that its mass is 240 kDa. This 240-kDa protein does not accumulate to detectable levels in rec1-1, rec1-2, rec1-3, or rec1-4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C). We found that, similar to the rec1-1 allele, the three T-DNA insertion alleles inhibited the far-red block of greening (Fig. 1A). We found that the chlorophyll levels in rec1-1 were 71% of wild type. In contrast, we found that the chlorophyll levels of rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 were 57–58% of wild type (Fig. 1B) and 81–82% of rec1-1 (P = 0.001–0.006). We conclude that rec1-1 attenuated the accumulation of chlorophyll and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 are null alleles. These data are consistent with rec1-1 expressing a truncated protein that promotes the accumulation of chlorophyll. We were not able to detect such a truncated protein because our antibodies bind residues that are carboxyl-terminal to Q1415. To test whether the three T-DNA insertion mutants are gun mutants, we grew them on media that contained either norflurazon or lincomycin. Norflurazon and lincomycin specifically block chloroplast biogenesis by distinct mechanisms and severely down-regulate the expression of PhANGs, such as the genes encoding the light harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of photosystem II (Lhcb) and the small subunit of RuBisCO (RbcS) (8). We found that rec1-1 accumulated 3.2- to 4.3-fold more Lhcb1.2 than wild type and that rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly more Lhcb1.2 mRNA than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). However, rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 accumulated significantly less Lhcb1.2 mRNA than rec1-1 (P < 0.0001–0.009) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). We observed a similar trend with RbcS1A expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In contrast, gun1-101 (12), a null allele of a relatively well studied GUN gene (8), induced 13- and 35-fold increases in Lhcb1.2 expression when chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with norflurazon and lincomycin treatments, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These data provide evidence that norflurazon treatments activate a repressive plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanism that is not activated by lincomycin treatments or that an inductive mechanism present in lincomycin-treated seedlings is absent in norflurazon-treated seedlings. In untreated seedlings, Lhcb1.2 mRNA accumulated to significantly lower levels in rec1-2, rec1-3, and rec1-4 than in wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), which is consistent with the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of these mutants (Fig. 1B). The levels of RbcS1A mRNA were not significantly different in the untreated wild type and rec1 mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Based on these data, we conclude that these rec1 alleles specifically disrupted the plastid-regulated expression of these PhANGs and that At1g01320 is REC1. Our characterization of these rec1 alleles indicates that rec1-1 behaves as a loss-of-function allele when the far-red block of greening and the chlorophyll accumulation phenotypes are scored and that rec1-1 enhances the levels of PhANG expression relative to other mutant alleles of REC1 when the gun phenotype is scored. A truncated REC1 protein that is partially active may underpin these phenotypes. There is precedence for mutant alleles causing both loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes (17, 18).Characterization of the REC Gene Family Mutants. The REC1 protein is homologous to three other Arabidopsis proteins that are encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and FRIENDLY (At3g52140) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The proteins encoded by At4g28080 and At1g15290 have no known function. Loss-of-function alleles of FRIENDLY and its orthologs in Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster cause mitochondrial clustering (19). FRIENDLY and orthologous proteins were reported to perform a variety of functions, such as binding and regulating atypical protein kinase C (20), binding mRNAs that encode mitochondrial proteins and promoting the biogenesis of mitochondria (21), and promoting intermitochondrial associations before mitochondrial fusion (13). The calculated masses of the proteins that are encoded by At4g28080, At1g15290, and FRIENDLY are 200 kDa, 180 kDa, and 150 kDa, respectively. We named At4g28080 and At1g15290 REC2 and REC3, respectively, based on their derived amino acid sequence similarity to REC1. REC1 is more similar to REC2 and REC3 than to FRIENDLY (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Homologs of REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY are present in other plant species (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In contrast, eukaryotes that do not perform photosynthesis contain only orthologs of FRIENDLY, usually as a single-copy gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). To test whether REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY contribute to the same or different processes as REC1, we obtained T-DNA insertion alleles for each of these genes. We found that T-DNA insertions reduced the levels of mRNA transcribed from these genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In REC3 mutants, the low levels of mRNA are not expected to encode functional proteins because the insertions are in exons. In REC2 and FRIENDLY mutants, the reduced levels of mRNA might express truncated proteins that are not functional. Indeed, three independent T-DNA insertions into REC2 caused chlorophyll to accumulate at significantly lower levels than in wild type, and these reduced levels of chlorophyll were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.3–0.6) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). We conclude that these three alleles are nulls. Based on the robust mitochondrial clustering phenotype of the T-DNA insertion allele of FRIENDLY (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B), we conclude that this allele is either a null or a strong loss-of-function allele. To determine the full impact of these four genes on chloroplast-related processes, we prepared double, triple, and quadruple mutants with rec1-3, rec2, rec3-1, and friendly in all possible combinations. We found that rec2, rec3-1, rec3-2, and friendly exhibited a far-red block of greening that was more similar to wild type than to rec1-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). We found that after 3 d of growth in far-red light, protochlorophyllide accumulated to significantly lower levels in rec1-3 than in wild type, protochlorophyllide accumulated to significantly higher levels in friendly than in wild type, and protochlorophyllide levels were not significantly different from wild type in rec2 and rec3-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). Significantly less protochlorophyllide accumulated in double and triple mutants containing rec1-3 and the quadruple mutants relative to the relevant single, double, and triple mutants (P < 0.0001–0.005). Significantly more protochlorophyllide accumulated in rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec2 friendly, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly than in rec3-1, rec1-3 rec3-1, rec1-3 rec2, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, respectively (P = 0.0003–0.02). We conclude that mutant alleles of REC1 inhibit the far-red block of greening by reducing the levels of protochlorophyllide. Attenuating phytochrome A signaling inhibits the far-red block of greening (15). Perhaps the simplest way to test for defects in phytochrome A signaling is to measure hypocotyl lengths in far-red light. We found that, in the dark, the lengths of the rec1-3 hypocotyls were not significantly different from wild type but that those of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were 11% shorter (SI Appendix, Fig. S8C). However, we found that in 3 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 far-red light, the hypocotyls of rec1-3 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly were not significantly different from wild type (P = 0.4–0.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D). We conclude that the inhibition of the far-red block of greening in rec1 mutants is probably not caused by defects in phytochrome A signaling. We found that when chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with a lincomycin treatment, Lhcb1.2 expression in rec2 and rec3-1 was 69% and 68% of the levels observed in wild type, respectively. In friendly, RbcS1A expression was increased 1.5-fold but Lhcb1.2 expression was not significantly different from wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Double and triple mutants containing rec1-3 and friendly tended to exhibit gun phenotypes, as did the quadruple mutant, whereas the double and triple mutants containing rec2 and rec3-1 generally did not exhibit gun phenotypes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). The most robust gun phenotype was observed for rec1-3 rec2 friendly, which accumulated 3.3- and 2.2-fold more mRNA from Lhcb1.2 and RbcS1A, respectively, than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S8E). Thus, this gene family makes significant but minor contributions to the plastid regulation of these PhANGs relative to GUN1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). REC gene family mutants appear chlorophyll-deficient (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). These chlorophyll deficiencies ranged from uniform chlorophyll deficiencies to virescence in rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). We quantified the chlorophyll levels of these mutants and found that rec1-3 and rec2 accumulated 63% and 81% of the chlorophyll found in wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In several instances, combinations of these alleles enhanced the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of rec1-3 and rec2. The most extreme examples were rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, which accumulated 31%, 21%, and 16% of the chlorophyll found in wild type, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast to rec1-3 and rec2, there was no significant difference in the levels of chlorophyll that accumulated in rec3-1, friendly, rec3-1 friendly, and wild type (P = 0.2–0.8) (Fig. 2). Additionally, rec3-1 and friendly did not affect the accumulation of chlorophyll in rec1-3 friendly, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.1–0.9) (Fig. 2). However, rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3 and rec1-3 rec2 (P < 0.0001), respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, rec3-1 attenuated the accumulation of chlorophyll in particular genetic contexts. Additionally, rec1-3 rec2 friendly accumulated significantly more chlorophyll than rec1-3 rec2 (P = 0.0004) and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly accumulated significantly less chlorophyll than rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.002) (Fig. 2). Thus, the effect of friendly on the accumulation of chlorophyll depended on the genetic context. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Chlorophyll levels in the REC gene family mutants. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Six biological replicates were analyzed for wild type (Col-0) and each mutant. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (P < 0.0001–0.0003).The chloroplast ultrastructure in many of the mutants resembled wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). The chloroplast ultrastructures of chlorophyll-deficient mutants typically resemble wild type (22, 23). The most severely chlorophyll-deficient mutants (Fig. 2) tended to have long and thin chloroplasts relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). Similar phenotypes were not reported for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis mutants, such as the severely chlorophyll-deficient gun4 hy1 and gun5 hy1 double mutants (22). Holes were observed in the chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 that were surrounded by double membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). These holes probably resulted from the sectioning of cytosolic protrusions into the chloroplasts that do not disrupt the chloroplast double membrane. Consistent with this interpretation, a mitochondrion was found in one of these holes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). The grana thylakoids of the mutants appeared similar to wild type, but rec1 rec2 rec3-1 contained fewer grana thylakoids than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). A reduction in the number of grana thylakoids is not commonly observed in Arabidopsis mutants unless the chlorophyll deficiencies are severe (22–24). The thylakoid membranes appeared swollen in four friendly mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S14) and similar to wild type in the other friendly mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Swelling of the thylakoid membranes was not reported previously for friendly mutants (13, 25). These data are consistent with complex interactions among these alleles affecting the ability of the thylakoid membranes to withstand osmotic pressure (26). To further characterize the chloroplast defects of these mutants, we imaged the chloroplasts in live cells from the abaxial epidermal cells to the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll cells in leaves using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found a number of differences relative to wild type. These differences included a tendency of the chloroplasts to localize along the anticlinal walls of mesophyll cells, enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence in both the mesophyll and epidermal cells, and fewer chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells in particular triple mutants and the quadruple mutant (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S15). The chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells residing along the anticlinal walls and the increases in chlorophyll fluorescence are consistent with increased sensitivity to light (27, 28). To test whether a potentially enhanced sensitivity to light led to a rise in the levels of reactive oxygen species, we stained leaves with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) to detect hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively. These mutants appear to accumulate variable levels of reactive oxygen species (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Live-cell imaging analysis of the chloroplasts from the REC gene family mutants. (A) Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of chloroplasts from the REC gene family mutants, cch, and gun4-1. Plants were grown on soil for 24 d. Each representative image was obtained by Z stacking 20 images from the abaxial surface of the leaf beginning in the epidermis and ending in the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll. (Scale bar, 20 μm.) (B) Fractal dimensions of the REC gene family mutants. Values of DF were calculated from five to seven representative images to compare the geometric complexity of the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant. Plant growth was as in A. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001–0.045). (C) Lacunarity parameters of the REC gene family mutants. Values of Λ were calculated from five to seven representative images to compare the gaps in the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant. Plant growth, error bars, and asterisk definition were as in B (P < 0.0001–0.02).The chlorophyll biosynthesis mutants cch and gun4-1 (29, 30) were analyzed to test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might cause similar phenotypes. cch and gun4-1 were previously reported to accumulate only 30–40% of the chlorophyll found in wild type (30). Similar to the REC gene family mutants, the chloroplasts of cch and gun4-1 appeared along the anticlinal walls in mesophyll cells (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with the enhanced sensitivities of chlorophyll-deficient mutants to light (31). cch exhibited enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence relative to gun4-1 and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S15). Thus, chlorophyll deficiencies were not correlated with increases in chlorophyll fluorescence. The distribution of chloroplasts within the mesophyll cells in many of these mutants appeared to differ from wild type (Fig. 3A). To quantify these differences, we calculated a fractal dimension (DF) and a lacunarity parameter (Λ) for each image (32). Calculating DF allowed us to compare the geometric complexity of the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant (32). Calculating Λ allowed us to compare the heterogeneity (e.g., the gaps) in the distribution of chloroplasts in wild type and each mutant (32). Significant differences in the value of the DF were observed in nine of these mutants (Fig. 3B). The values for DF were not significantly different from wild type in rec1-3, rec1-3 rec3-1, and mutants containing both rec3-1 and friendly, namely rec3-1 friendly, rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly (Fig. 3B). In contrast to other mutants containing both rec3-1 and friendly, the DF of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly was significantly less than wild type (Fig. 3B). This difference may reflect the decrease in the number of the chloroplasts in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly relative to other mutants that contain both rec3-1 and friendly (Fig. 3A). Chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the differences in geometric complexities of these images because although the DF values of the images from cch were significantly less than wild type, the DF values of the images from gun4-1 were not significantly different from wild type (Fig. 3B). Λ was significantly reduced in all of the mutants except rec2 and rec1-3 rec3-1 (Fig. 3C). Although Λ was significantly less in gun4-1 than in wild type, Λ was not significantly different between cch and wild type (Fig. 3C). Based on these data, we conclude that significant differences in the gaps of the chloroplast networks of the rec and friendly mutants were not caused by chlorophyll deficiencies. Our analysis of DF and Λ provides evidence that the rec alleles, friendly, and combinations of the rec and friendly alleles affect the distribution of chloroplasts. Differences in the numbers, sizes, and shapes of these chloroplasts may account for some of these differences in DF and Λ. Mutants with abnormal distributions of chloroplasts often exhibit abnormal chloroplast movements because of deficiencies in the machinery that helps chloroplasts track along the cytoskeleton. Abnormal chloroplast movements are readily detected with chloroplast photorelocation experiments (27). We found that chloroplast photorelocation was indistinguishable between rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S17 and Movies S1 and S2). We also imaged stromules by targeting yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the plastids because the number of stromules is reduced when the association of stromules and the cytoskeleton is disrupted (33). We observed no significant differences in the appearance or number of stromules in wild type, rec1-3, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.1–0.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S18). To quantify the reduced chloroplast compartment size phenotypes that we observed in live cells from the cortical region of the spongy mesophyll, we fixed leaf sections with glutaraldehyde and quantified the plan areas of fixed mesophyll cells and their chloroplasts (3). In the mutants, the size of the chloroplast compartment in the glutaraldehyde-fixed cells appeared reduced relative to wild type, especially in particular triple mutants and the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4A). The number of chloroplasts was correlated with the mesophyll cell plan area in each mutant and wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S19). This correlation was previously demonstrated for wild type (2, 3, 7). We found that in many of the mutants, the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area was reduced relative to wild type. The greatest reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area were 44–62%, observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 friendly, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S19). The reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area exhibited by rec1-3 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec3-1 friendly (24–25%) were significantly greater than in the relevant single mutants (P < 0.0001–0.03) (Fig. 4B). Without rec1-3, combinations of rec2, rec3-1, and friendly did not significantly decrease the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area. In most instances, friendly did not significantly affect the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area (P = 0.0714–0.9198). However, a significant increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area was observed in rec2 rec3-1 friendly relative to rec2 rec3-1 (P = 0.0003). Based on these data, we conclude that rec1-3 attenuates the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area more than the other mutant alleles tested and that friendly promotes the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area in a specific genetic context.

A log transformation of the percent chloroplast coverage is presented. Error bars represent SEM. The asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference relative to wild type (Col-0) (P < 0.0001–0.02).The mutants with no or small (15–25%) reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area also exhibited small (7–14%) reductions in chloroplast plan area relative to wild type (Fig. 4C). The largest reduction in chloroplast plan area was 22% observed in rec2 rec3-1 friendly. However, rec2 rec3-1 friendly was unusual relative to the other mutants tested in that it also exhibited a 17% increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area relative to wild type (Fig. 4B). In contrast to the other mutants, the three most chlorophyll-deficient REC gene family mutants (rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly; Fig. 2) exhibited 31–46% increases in their chloroplast plan areas relative to wild type (Fig. 4C). The increases in chloroplast plan area observed in rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly are small compared with the 500% to ∼2,000% enlargements in chloroplast plan area that were reported for chloroplast division mutants (2, 5, 34). These findings are consistent with the idea that rec and friendly alleles disrupt mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division rather than those that perform chloroplast division. Numerous signals appear to regulate chloroplast division (2). Consistent with the observed large reductions in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and either no increases or small increases in chloroplast plan area, we found that chloroplast coverage (total chloroplast plan area per cell plan area) was significantly reduced in many of the mutants compared with wild type (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S20). Moreover, we observed a significant interaction between the presence of rec1-3 and the number of mutant alleles (P < 0.00001). In the presence of rec1-3, chloroplast coverage fell as the number of mutant alleles increased (Fig. 4D). The greatest reduction in chloroplast coverage (50%) was observed in the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4D). In contrast, when plants contained REC1, adding further mutant alleles did not significantly reduce chloroplast coverage, regardless of the number of mutant alleles present (Fig. 4D). Normalizing chlorophyll levels (Fig. 2) to chloroplast coverage (Fig. 4D) indicates that the chloroplasts of friendly accumulated significantly more chlorophyll than wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). This analysis also indicates that the reduced chloroplast coverage phenotypes explain the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes in rec2, rec2 rec3-1, rec2 friendly, and rec2 rec3-1 friendly and the differences between the severely chlorophyll-deficient mutants rec1-3 rec2 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 and between rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). However, normalizing chlorophyll levels to chloroplast coverage does not explain the chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes of rec1-3, the double and triple mutants that contain rec1-3, or the quadruple mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S21). Thus, rec1-3 attenuates both chloroplast coverage and the accumulation of chlorophyll. To test whether chlorophyll deficiencies might contribute to these chloroplast coverage phenotypes, we analyzed glutaraldehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, gun4-1, and cch grown in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light rather than the 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light that was used for the previous experiments. Reducing the irradiance increases chlorophyll levels in chlorophyll-deficient mutants (31). When grown in 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light, the individual chloroplasts of cch were difficult to distinguish by differential interference contrast microscopy. We also analyzed the glutaraldehyde-fixed mesophyll cells from four mutants grown in 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light: the plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutant gun1-101 (12) and the chlorophyll-deficient and photomorphogenic mutants constitutive photomorphogenic 1-4 (cop1-4), de-etiolated 1-1 (det1-1), and phytochrome A phytochrome B double mutant (phyA phyB) (35). We found that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly accumulated more than twofold higher levels of chlorophyll in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light relative to 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 C and D) and that rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB were chlorophyll-deficient relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Figs. S22 C and D, S23 A, D, and E, S24, and S25 C and D). The average number of chloroplasts per cell plan area decreased and the average chloroplast plan area increased in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and wild type in 35 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light relative to 125 μmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 white light (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 A, E, and F). We observed a variety of significant differences in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and chloroplast plan area phenotypes of gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB relative to wild type (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 B, D, F, and G and S25 A, B, E, and F). The more than twofold increase in chlorophyll levels did not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly (SI Appendix, Fig. S22 B and G). Chloroplast coverage was not significantly different from wild type in gun4-1, cch, cop1-4, det1-1, or phyA phyB (P = 0.7–1.0) (SI Appendix, Figs. S23 C, D, and H and S25 B and G). The number of chloroplasts per cell plan area, chloroplast plan area, and chloroplast coverage phenotypes of gun1-101 were not significantly different from wild type (P = 0.6–0.8) (SI Appendix, Fig. S26). We conclude that both the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area and chloroplast plan area are probably controlled by a number of mechanisms that regulate chloroplast division, and that these signals include light signaling and signals induced by chlorophyll deficiencies. Chlorophyll deficiencies do not completely explain these phenotypes because, although the chloroplast plan areas were larger than wild type in cop1-4, det1-1, phyA phyB, rec1-3 rec2, rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1, and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the chloroplast plan areas were smaller than wild type in cch and gun4-1. Additionally, we conclude that, in general, altering light-regulated development and significantly attenuating the accumulation of chlorophyll do not affect chloroplast coverage in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells. We also conclude that chlorophyll deficiencies do not explain the reduced chloroplast coverage phenotypes of the rec mutants. We found that two components of the chloroplast division machinery—filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ)1-1 and FtsZ2-1—accumulated to lower levels in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly than in wild type (SI Appendix, Fig. S27). Reducing the levels of FtsZ1-1 and FtsZ2-1 inhibits chloroplast division but does not affect chloroplast coverage (36). Any number of signals may down-regulate the expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. The reduced expression of FtsZ1-1 and Fts2-1 may partially explain the enlarged chloroplasts of rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. To test whether the levels of the REC1 protein limit the size of the chloroplast compartment, we used the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus to drive the overexpression of REC1 in sgs3 rdr6-11—a double mutant that is resistant to transgene-induced gene silencing (37). We found three independent transgenic lines that accumulated more REC1 protein than sgs3 rdr6-11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S28). Chloroplast coverage increased from 11% to 17% in the transgenic lines that accumulated elevated levels of REC1 (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S29). In lines 40 and 66, the increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to result mostly from an increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell plan area without a significant change in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts (Fig. 5B). However, plots of total chloroplast plan area and chloroplast number versus cell plan area provide evidence for heterogeneity in the organellar basis for the increase in chloroplast coverage for line 40 (SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the attenuation of chloroplast division in some of the larger cells from line 40. In line 44, the increase in chloroplast coverage appeared to result from an increase in the plan areas of individual chloroplasts and no change in the number of chloroplasts per cell (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Fig. S29), possibly resulting from the misregulation of chloroplast division in this particular transgenic plant.

Error bars and asterisk definition are as in C (P < 0.0001).Subcellular Distribution of REC1. To gain insight into the mechanism that underpins the biological functions of REC1, we determined the subcellular distribution of REC1 by fusing YFP to the carboxyl terminus of REC1, transiently expressing the REC1-YFP fusion protein in tobacco leaves and monitoring the subcellular distribution of REC1-YFP by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To test whether REC1-YFP was transiently expressed as a full-length protein, we analyzed leaf sections expressing REC1-YFP by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoblotting analysis indicates that REC1-YFP accumulates as a single band (SI Appendix, Fig. S30A) and that the mass of REC1-YFP is greater than the mass of native REC1 (SI Appendix, Figs. S3D and S30B). Live-cell confocal microscopy analyses with settings that distinguish GFP, YFP, and chlorophylls (38) show REC1-YFP in the nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 6A). The nucleus is recognizable by the appearance of the nucleolus (Fig. 6A, arrow) and by the localization of ssGFP-HDEL, an endoplasmic reticulum marker that defines the nuclear envelope (39) (Fig. 6B). We found that REC1-YFP is excluded from chloroplasts (Fig. 6 C and D). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Subcellular distribution of REC1-YFP in herbicide-treated and untreated leaf cells. Micrographs of untreated tobacco cells (A–D) and amitrole-treated tobacco cells (E–H): REC1-YFP (A and E), HDEL-GFP (B and F), chlorophyll fluorescence (C and G), and merged images (D and H). (Scale bars, 10 μm.) (I) Representative tobacco plant 10 d after amitrole treatment. The red arrow indicates the leaf infiltrated with amitrole. The blue arrow indicates the site of coinfiltration with REC1-YFP and HDEL-GFP.To test whether the functional state of the chloroplast might affect the subcellular distribution of REC1, we infiltrated one leaf of a tobacco plant with amitrole, an herbicide that causes chlorophyll deficiencies (40). We found that amitrole caused observable chlorophyll deficiencies in leaves that developed from shoot apical meristems after infiltrations (Fig. 6I). We suggest that amitrole moved from the sites of infiltrations to the shoot apical meristem, where it attenuated the chloroplast biogenesis that occurred during leaf development. In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, chloroplasts were significantly smaller than in untreated leaves (Fig. 6 C and G). In these chlorophyll-deficient leaves, REC1-YFP localized to the cytosol and was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 6 E–H). We tested whether REC1 was enriched in nuclear and cytosolic fractions prepared from Arabidopsis seedlings. The enrichment of histone H3 and UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively, indicates that nuclei and cytosols were enriched in these preparations (Fig. 7A). Using affinity-purified anti-REC1 antibodies (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), we found that REC1 was enriched in these nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 7A). Although these anti-REC1 antibodies recognized multiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, they recognized only one band in the whole-seedling extracts prepared using denaturing conditions (Fig. 7A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). We conclude that the affinity-purified anti-REC1 antibodies recognize multiple bands in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, because partial proteolysis of REC1 occurred during the purification of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. Next, we tested whether herbicides affect the levels of REC1 in purified nuclei. We found that REC1 was present at similar levels in nuclei regardless of whether nuclei were purified from untreated seedlings or seedlings that lacked functional chloroplasts because chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with a norflurazon treatment (Fig. 7 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S31A). When chloroplast biogenesis was blocked with an amitrole treatment, much longer exposures of immunoblots than used to detect REC1 in the nuclear fractions from norflurazon-treated and untreated seedlings provided evidence that only trace quantities of REC1 accumulated in nuclei purified from amitrole-treated seedlings (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix, Fig. S31A). Methyl viologen induces a rise in the levels of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species that causes chloroplast dysfunction and activates the plastid-to-nucleus signaling that induces the expression of nuclear genes, such as the nuclear genes that encode cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (41). To test whether chloroplastic reactive oxygen species affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1, we transferred 5-d-old seedlings to a growth medium that contained 1 μM methyl viologen and allowed the seedlings to grow for an additional 3 d. Higher levels of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase and lower levels of chlorophyll accumulated in the methyl viologen-treated seedlings than in untreated seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig. S31 B–D). We conclude that this methyl viologen treatment induced chloroplast dysfunction and the expression of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, probably by inducing a rise in the levels of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species. We found that REC1 accumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of methyl viologen-treated and untreated seedlings (Fig. 7C). In addition to inhibiting chloroplast function, amitrole inhibits root elongation (40), which depends on cell division and cell elongation (42). To test whether inhibiting cell expansion might drive REC1 out of the nucleus, we tested whether REC1 accumulates in the nuclei of the Arabidopsis null mutant rhd3-7 (43). rhd3-7 and other RHD3 mutants are smaller than wild type because cell expansion is inhibited in these mutants (SI Appendix, Fig. S31A) (43, 44). We found that REC1 accumulated to similar levels in the nuclei of rhd3-7 and wild type (Fig. 7D). We conclude that amitrole treatments specifically exclude REC1 from the nucleus. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Subcellular distribution of REC1 in herbicide-treated and untreated seedlings. (A) Subcellular distribution of REC1 in untreated seedlings. Whole-seedling extracts (WSE), nuclear fractions (NF), and cytosolic fractions (CF) were prepared from 8-d-old seedlings that were grown on LS medium that lacked an herbicide.

Whole-seedling extracts and nuclear fractions were analyzed as in A. (D) Levels of REC1 in nuclei purified from rhd3-7. Plant growth and analysis of whole-seedling extracts and nuclear fractions were as in A.Discussion Our phenotypic characterizations provide evidence that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family link increases in mesophyll cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment size. Other than the proteins encoded by the REC gene family, there are no candidates for proteins that contribute to this mechanism (2, 6, 45). Cells of the shoot apical meristem contain fewer than 10 proplastids. After chloroplast biogenesis and during the mesophyll cell expansion that occurs during leaf development, there is a large increase in the number of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells (45). The mesophyll cells from rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly contained 22 ± 8 chloroplasts (SI Appendix, Figs. S19 and S22A). Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment is partially active in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. A few models are consistent with these data. One possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family directly contribute to the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment and that this mechanism retains partial activity in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly. Another possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family regulate a mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. A third possibility is that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family contribute to a mechanism that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and a distinct mechanism that does not require the REC genes independently contributes to the size of the chloroplast compartment. Further study of the REC genes may lead to the ability to rationally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment and to the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, which is anticipated to increase yields from important crops, such as rice (9, 11). The contribution of the REC genes to the distribution of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells may also contribute to the engineering of C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants, because the distribution of chloroplasts within mesophyll cells differs between C3 and C4 plants (11). The rec and friendly mutants appear deficient in a mechanism that is distinct from the mechanisms that are deficient in other chloroplast distribution mutants because in contrast to the normal photorelocation observed in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly, the photorelocation of chloroplasts is abnormal in other chloroplast distribution mutants (27). In contrast to the rec2, rec3, and friendly alleles that we tested, rec1-3 reduces the accumulation of chlorophyll. This observation raised the possibility that the chlorophyll deficiencies of the rec1 mutants might prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with a mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. Indeed, in crumpled leaf (crl) and clumped chloroplasts 1 (clmp1), chloroplasts do not keep pace with this mechanism because chloroplasts are not equally distributed between daughter cells during cell division (46, 47). Our finding that inducing an increase in the levels of chlorophyll does not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and that chloroplast coverage is not significantly different from wild type in the chlorophyll-deficient mutants cch, gun4-1, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates that chlorophyll deficiencies do not prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. Chlorophyll deficiency is a common phenotype in Arabidopsis. Thus, disrupting any number of chloroplast functions may indirectly affect the thylakoid membranes. Indeed, disrupting mechanisms that drive chloroplast division and mechanisms that potentially regulate chloroplast division appears to indirectly affect the normal development of the thylakoid membranes (34, 48, 49) and the accumulation of chlorophyll (47, 50, 51). The screening of 3,500 ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) mutants for plants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage (3), was not sufficient to saturate this screen (52). Nonetheless, screening ∼2,000 EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis plants is usually sufficient for isolating specific mutants (53). Indeed, the screen of Pyke and Leech (3) yielded more than 10 different genes that, in most instances, encode proteins that directly contribute to chloroplast division (2). An additional screen of 10,000 EMS mutants for plants with enlarged chloroplasts yielded only one additional gene that directly contributes to chloroplast division (54). Additionally, a screen of 5,200 Arabidopsis mutants that were homozygous for T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes that mostly encode chloroplast proteins for mutants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage, yielded one chloroplast division mutant and no chloroplast coverage mutants (46). These data and our finding that chloroplast coverage is not different from wild type in cch, gun4-1, gun1-101, cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicate that a reduction in the size of the chloroplast compartment is not a common phenotype. We suggest that the REC genes may directly contribute to a mechanism that links increases in the size of the chloroplast compartment to increases in the size of mesophyll cells because reduced chloroplast coverage is not a common phenotype and because overexpressing REC1 induces significant increases in chloroplast coverage. Our finding that the REC1 protein resides in the cytosol and nucleus further supports the idea that REC1 helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment because this mechanism is expected to reside in an extraplastidic compartment. A less than twofold increase in chloroplast coverage was observed in the fully expanded leaves and mature green fruits of the high pigment 1 (hp-1) mutant of tomato (55). HP-1 encodes UV-damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) (56). DDB1 interacts with DET1, a master repressor of light-regulated development that contributes to ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated protein degradation (35). Our analysis of cop1-4, det1-1, and phyA phyB indicates that defects in light-regulated development do not necessarily affect the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells. The biochemical functions of REC1, REC2, and REC3 are not known. FRIENDLY appears to perform a variety of functions (13, 20, 21). The indistinguishable photorelocation of chloroplasts that we observed in wild type and rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and the localization of REC1 to both the cytosol and the nucleus conflict with the idea that REC proteins directly contribute to the tracking of chloroplasts along the cytoskeleton. Similarly, mitochondrial clustering in friendly does not result from a cytoskeletal or motor defect (13). The enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplasts aligning along the anticlinal walls, abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure, and chlorophyll deficiencies in the rec and friendly mutants indicate that these mutant alleles induce chloroplast dysfunction. REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY may contribute to processes in the cytosol and nucleus that promote the function of chloroplasts and mitochondria. Consistent with this interpretation, FRIENDLY was localized to the cytosol, and mutations in FRIENDLY and the Drosophila ortholog of FRIENDLY induce metabolic dysfunction (13, 57). The finding that REC1 is excluded from the nucleus when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked or attenuated with an amitrole treatment is consistent with a plastid signaling mechanism that is activated by amitrole treatments regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. This inference follows because proteins larger than ∼40 kDa are actively transported across the nuclear envelope (58) and because the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of proteins contributes to a number of processes, including diverse signaling mechanisms (35, 58). The finding that, in contrast to amitrole treatments, norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments do not exclude REC1 from the nucleus is consistent with a plastid signaling mechanism that is activated by amitrole treatments but not activated by norflurazon and methyl viologen treatments regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. Consistent with this interpretation, plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms appear numerous (8). Another possibility is that an extraplastidic mechanism that is inhibited by amitrole treatments might affect the subcellular distribution of REC1 because in contrast to norflurazon and methyl viologen (8, 59), amitrole is not a specific inhibitor of chloroplast function. Although amitrole inhibits plastidic processes, such as carotenoid biosynthesis and histidine biosynthesis, amitrole is more effective at inhibiting root elongation, which depends on cell division and cell elongation (40). Our findings that the REC genes link increases in cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment size and that amitrole specifically affects the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 are consistent with the inhibition of cell expansion regulating the subcellular distribution of REC1. If the inhibition of cell expansion excludes REC1 from the nucleus, rhd3-7 may not affect the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 because rhd3-7 does not sufficiently inhibit cell expansion. Amitrole treatments may inhibit a process in the nucleus by excluding REC1 from the nucleus. Alternatively, amitrole-treated plants may attempt to stimulate a cytosolic process by driving REC1 into the cytosol. Another possibility is that REC1 performs the same function or different functions in the nucleus and the cytosol. In summary, we provide evidence that REC1, REC2, REC3, and FRIENDLY promote the proper morphology, function, and size of the chloroplast compartment. These functions may depend on the trafficking of REC1 between the nucleus and the cytosol. Signals activated by the inhibition of cell expansion or chloroplast dysfunction may regulate this mechanism. Understanding the biochemical function of REC1 and the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1 may lead to the rational manipulation of the size of the chloroplast compartment and higher yields from important crops.Materials and Methods Detailed information on the materials and methods used in this study is provided in SI Appendix. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions. All mutants used in this study were derived from A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0). Plants were grown on soil or on Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) growth medium in either broad-spectrum white light or far-red light in controlled-environment chambers. The far-red block of greening experiments were adapted from Barnes et al. (15).Analysis of Chlorophylls. Chlorophylls were extracted using N,N′-dimethylformamide and quantified by spectrophotometry.Analysis of Chloroplasts by Microscopy. Chloroplasts were imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Chlorophyll fluorescence, DF, and Λ were calculated from maximum-intensity projection images built from Z-stack images. The chloroplast number per cell plan area, chloroplast plan area, and chloroplast coverage were quantified as described previously (3).Construction, Expression, and Imaging of the REC1-YFP Fusion Gene. The ORF that encodes YFP was fused in-frame and downstream of an ORF that encodes the full-length REC1. Transient expression of REC1-YFP in Nicotiana tabacum was performed by infiltrating amitrole-treated or untreated leaves with an Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the REC1-YFP fusion gene. The imaging of YFP fluorescence was performed using confocal laser scanning confocal microscopes.Analysis of Whole-Seedling Extracts, Nuclear Fractions, and Cytosolic Fractions. Seedlings were grown on LS medium containing no sucrose or on the same medium containing 1% sucrose and an herbicide. Whole-seedling extracts were prepared by boiling frozen and powdered seedlings in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and then clarifying these extracts by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Nuclei were purified from seedlings using Percoll step gradients. Cytosolic fractions were the supernatants that were obtained by lysing purified protoplasts and then clarifying these lysates by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting.Supplementary Material Supplementary File pnas.1515741113.sapp.pdf (33.7MB, pdf) Supplementary File Download video file (704.1KB, avi) Supplementary File Download video file (484.4KB, avi) Acknowledgments We thank Dean DellaPenna (Michigan State University) for providing the recombinant inbred lines CL67, CL35, and CL115.

    "abstract": "Summary Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life. Keywords: Unfolded protein response, ER stress, IRE1, bZIP60, bZIP28, Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "introduction": "Introduction As the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to secretory pathway (Vitale and Denecke 1999), the primary site of phospholipid synthesis (Ohlrogge and Browse 1995), a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules (Light et al. 2016, Ron and Walter 2007, Shore et al. 2011), and the assembly plant for a third of a cell's total proteome (Wallin and Heijne 1998), interruptions in its functions can have vast consequences in cellular health. Under physiological conditions of growth, a dedicated battery of ER-resident proteins can prevent misfolding of nascent polypeptides and facilitate acquisition of the proper tertiary structure through post-translational modification (e.g., covalent addition of oligosaccharide chains or catalysis of disulfide bond formation) (Dobson 2003, Gupta and Tuteja 2011). In plants affected by environmental stress (e.g. heat stress (Gidalevitz et al. 2011)), proper folding of secretory proteins can be impaired and misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress (Dobson 2003, Hartl and Haver-Hartl 2009, Buchberger et al 2010). Indeed, under prolonged or severe levels of stress, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins can become cytotoxic and lead to death of the plant cell in a manner akin to the effect of misfolded proteins that aggregate and cause human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hoozemans et al. 2005). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms designed to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Specialized ER-localized membrane proteins are able to detect the buildup of unfolded proteins and activate signaling cascades that modulate the abundance of the proteins dedicated to the folding of nascent polypeptides within the ER to maintain homeostasis (Ron and Walter 2007, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015). In metazoans the ER-localized stress sensor array consists of the Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and Protein kinase R-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) (Harding et al. 1999, Shen et al. 2002, Wang et al. 1998). In plants, the functional homologs of IRE1 and ATF6 (termed IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 in Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified to date (Iwata and Koizumi 2012). In yeast, only the IRE1-dependent UPR pathway has been identified (Ron and Walter 2007, Mori 2009). A number of comparative reviews have highlighted the similarities between UPR components shared among plants, metazoans and yeast, and should be referred to for greater contexts on the depth of gene conservation shared by all eukaryotes in regards to UPR-related mechanisms (Chen and Brandizzi 2013, Liu and Howell 2016, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015). The study of the UPR in human and animal models largely centers on genetic defects that allow the buildup of misfolded proteins, and mitigating the cytotoxic effects of the resulting aggregates (Rao and Bredesen 2004, Stefani and Dobson 2003). In plants, UPR research also focuses on improving crop yield under adverse environmental conditions. There is a large potential for biotechnological applications for UPR-related mechanisms in ensuring plant productivity. However, considerable work must be done to understand how the UPR is integrated into intra and intercellular signaling mechanisms that are plant specific. Even though there is considerable evidence to suggest that the UPR components are required for many different aspects of plant physiology, from seed germination to meristematic maintenance (Barba-Espín et al. 2014, Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Chen et al. 2014, Deng et al. 2013, Klein et al. 2006, Deng et al. 2016, Meng et al. 2016), we are only beginning to connect the molecular activities of IRE1 and bZIP28 to the modulation of organism growth and development. In this review, we provide a summary of causative ER stress conditions followed by an examination of UPR signaling pathways through a discussion of recent advancements in the field. Given space constraints, this review focuses mainly on UPR studies in the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Throughout, we draw attention of the reader to new developments in the context of plant growth, development, and metabolic functioning. This is done in an attempt to move beyond a classical linear signal transduction paradigm, and visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life. ER Quality Control and Important ER Client Proteins Mediate both Programmed Cell Death and Cell Cycle Control If the plant cell was reimagined as a city, it would be easy to see how the ER could be described as the town's central factory. At the ER, shipments of raw materials in the form of amino acids and carbohydrates are reshaped and assembled into fully-functional molecular machines in the form of proteins. Properly folded proteins are then shipped out and utilized for a variety of different purposes in different places throughout or outside the cell. In order to prevent the production of faulty goods, the ER has specific machinery, collectively called ER quality control (ERQC), to survey the protein folding status, facilitate folding and ensure quality of the produced protein. The production of most secretory proteins begins with the co-translational introduction of the protein into the ER. In this process, specific peptide sequences target nascent polypeptide chains to the ER and are translocated across the membrane as they are synthesized via the Sec translocon, which is largely conserved between yeast and plants (Akopian et al. 2013, Denecke et al. 1992, Deneke et al. 1993, Schweiger and Schenkert 2013). As the polypeptide enters the ER lumen, molecular chaperones such as the luminal binding proteins (BiPs), bind to the chain of the nascent polypeptides and prevent premature folding (Carvalho et al. 2014, Foresti et al. 2003). The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Lerouxel et al. 2005) recognizes specific amino acid sequences and transfers N-linked glycans to the peptides. In some cases, this post translational modification adds to the intrinsic stability or solubility of a protein, and importantly, it functions as a recognition beacon for major ER luminal foldase complexes (Sinclair and Elliott 2005). Nascent polypeptides undergo iterative folding cycles where they are passed between the calnexin/calreticulin complex, and UDP-glucose glycoprotein-glucosyltransferase (UGGT), which monitor protein folding and retains unfolded proteins in the ER (Totani et al., 2009) as a part of the ERQC. Other proteins participate in folding cycles under the purview of these central ER foldase complexes, such as thioredoxins (e.g protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs)), which catalyze the reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds (Bottomley et al. 2001, Wilkinson and Gilbert 2004). Properly folded proteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, while the unfolded or irremediably misfolded proteins are picked up by proteins like OS9 of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, dislocated out of the ER, ubiquitinated, and finally degraded by the 26S proteasome (Huttner et al. 2012). The process is conserved across eukaryotes and, for example, it mediates the proper folding of critical client plasma membrane receptor proteins in plants, including the Arabidopsis elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor which mediates pathogen associated molecular pattern based immunity (Li et al. 2009) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) receptor (Li and Chory 1997). Although not directly related to the activation of the UPR, the essential physiological relevance of these folding processes, which are monitored by the UPR regulators (via unfolded protein accumulation), are continuously being demonstrated. Beyond enabling proper function of cellular signaling pathways with receptors at the plasma membrane (like EF-Tu and BRI1), the specificity of N-linked glycosylation-bearing proteins has recently been shown to play important roles in regulating cell death. The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) and SERK4 (somatic embryo receptor kinase 4) both interact with immune receptors and BRI1 and negatively regulate hypersensitive response-like programmed cell death (PCD) through yet-unknown mechanisms (Gou et al. 2012, Li et al. 2002, Nam and Li 2002, Roux et al. 2011). Intriguingly, loss of STT3a (staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3), one of the two catalytic subunits of the OST complex involved in N-glycosylation of ER proteins, is linked to the cell death phenotype observed in BAK1/SERK4 silenced plants (de Oliveira et al. 2016). However, UPR deficient mutants did not respond differently to BAK1/SERK1 silencing, which led to the conclusion that UPR regulators IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 may not modulate this specific type of PCD (de Oliveira et al. 2016). When examined under salt stress conditions, a stt3a knockout line showed UPR activation and halted cell cycle progression in a similar manner to that described in yeast and mammalian cells after being subjected to ER stress-inducing conditions (Arnold and Tanner 1982, Brewer et al. 1999, Koiwa et al. 2003). This may suggest a possible antagonistic role between STT3a and the UPR components, or may simply indicate that the proteins needed to adapt to salt stress may be glycosylated in order to fold or function properly. In both cases, although the UPR may not directly regulate the expression of BAK1/SERK4 or N-glycosylated salt protective genes, these examples underscore the importance of maintaining the ER as a fully-functional protein folding factory so a plant may adapt to various sources of stresses. The Causes of ER Stress: Unavoidable Exogenous Threats Enhancing the UPR appears potentially critical to efforts to maintain crop productivity by priming plants to survive under adverse environmental conditions (Valente et al. 2009, Carvalho et al. 2014, Luan et al. 2016 Xiang et al. 2016). One of the most thoroughly described environmental UPR inducer is heat stress (Deng et al. 2011, Duke and Doehlert 1996, Gao et al. 2008, Schmollinger et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2009). More conveniently than heat conditions in the lab, chemical UPR inducers such as tunicamycin, which inhibits the N-linked glycosylation in the ER lumen, are often used to investigate the UPR in many eukaryotic model organisms by mimicking the conditions associated with environmental stresses that cause the buildup of unfolded proteins. Extreme osmotic stress and heavy metals such as selenium have also shown to induce the UPR (Liu et al. 2007, Van Hoewyk 2016). The UPR also plays a role in response to pathogens and other biotic stresses (Moreno et al. 2012, Prasch and Sonnewald 2013, Zhang et al. 2015). Through an unknown mechanism, treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the biotic stress-hormone salicylic acid (SA) was shown to activate both arms of the UPR controlled by IRE1 and bZIP28 (Moreno et al. 2012, Nagashima et al. 2014). This SA-induced UPR activation was also given context by Meng et al. (2016), which showed that the SA-accumulating cpr5 (Constitutive Expression of PR genes 5) mutant is dependent on the UPR to suppress growth. Other studies have demonstrated the interesting effect of organelle sourced reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. plastids and mitochondria) on the induction of the UPR (Ozgur et al. 2015) suggesting a possible functional connection between the UPR and non-secretory organelles. It was demonstrated that plastid-originated ROS production induced UPR activation suggesting that plastidial stress may be intimately linked with, and responded to, through the ER stress signal transduction mechanisms (Ozgur et al. 2015). Given the close connections between SA and ROS signaling (Torres et al. 2006, Mou et al. 2003), these observations may indicate a functional link between the two UPR activating conditions. The Canonical Response to Unfolded Proteins: New Look at the Master Regulators IRE1, bZIP60, and bZIP28 IRE1 In environmentally stressful conditions, the accumulation of unfolded and irremediably misfolded proteins leads to the activation of the UPR via IRE1 and bZIP28 (Figure 1). Although the activation mechanism of IRE1 has yet to be established in plants, studies of IRE1 in yeast have indicated that BiP binds the IRE1 luminal domain in non-stressful conditions. However, upon stress, BiP chaperones preferentially bind unfolded proteins thereby freeing the ER luminal domains of IRE1 (Pincus et al. 2010). Unfolded proteins then bind to IRE1 (Gardner and Walter 2011) which oligomerizes; as a consequence, the kinase domain in the cytosolic portion of the protein is autophosphorylated (Shamu and Walter 1996, Welihinda and Kaufman 1996). These steps lead to activation of the IRE1 ribonuclease domain (Cox and Walter 1996). In mammalian cells misfolded proteins bind to BiP chaperones which keep IRE1 in an inactive monomeric state under normal conditions (Berlotti et al. 2000). After dissociation from BiP, interactions between the freed luminal domains of IRE1 bring cytoplasmic domains together allowing the necessary autophosphorylation (Credle et al. 2005, Ali et al. 2011). Although the underlying mechanisms for activation of plant IRE1 are not known, it is certain that activation of IRE1 results in the unconventional cytosolic splicing of the mRNA transcripts of bZIP60, the only UPR target of plant IRE1 known to date (Deng, et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011, Hayashi et al. 2012, Lu et al. 2012, Li et al. 2012 Moreno et al. 2012). In Arabidopsis, the tRNA ligase RLG1 was recently shown to complete the splicing of bZIP60 in vitro by ligating the fragments derived from IRE1 cleavage (Nagashima et al. 2016). Whether the ligation of bZIP60 spliced transcripts is mediated by RLG1 in vivo, while likely, has yet to be experimentally demonstrated, partly due to the lethality of complete RLG1 loss-of-function mutations (Nagashima et al. 2016). In yeast and mammalian cells, the ligation of the functional equivalents of bZIP60, Hac1 and XbpI, respectively, occurs via tRNA ligases that operate in opposite fashion. In detail, the ligation of Hac1 mediated by RLG1p in yeast is completed in a 5’-3’ fashion followed by removal of 2` phosphate group by a phosphatase (Sawaya et al. 2003, Steiger et al. 2005). In mammalian cells, the ligation is mediated by RTCB, which operates in a 3’-5’ ligation (Jurkin et al. 2014). Evidence suggests that plants have evolved a 5’-3’ ligation mechanism similar to that found in yeast, and this finding is supported by observations that Arabidopsis RLG1 can also ligate the Hac1 mRNA in yeast cells (Mori et al. 2010). However, the resulting Hac1 transcripts are not efficiently translated indicating that functional differences between yeast and Arabidopsis catalytic mechanisms remain. The splicing of bZIP60 leads to a frameshift that removes a transmembrane domain from the translated transcription factor. Spliced bZIP60 subsequently translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional modulation of the downstream UPR target genes. Intriguingly, the activity of IRE1 is not limited to unconventional splicing of a transcription factor. Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) is a process which regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. Such IRE1 mediated cleavage of cytosolic and ER-associated mRNAs has been implicated in promoting cell death in yeast (Tam et al. 2014). In metazoans, RIDD activity under prolonged or severe ER stress also has proapoptotic effects, and can be associated with human diseases such as diabetes (Maurel et al. 2014, Hetz and Glimcher 2011). RIDD activity was also described for the Arabidopsis IRE1 homolog (Mishiba et al. 2013), although the implications related to stress outcomes are yet to be tested in vivo. Figure 1. Mechanisms of the plant UPR activation. Open in a new tab Environmental stresses (e.g. heat, oxidative stress, selenium, chemical inhibitors) negatively affect the protein folding process, leading to the buildup of unfolded proteins. Plastid stress promotes the buildup of MEcPP (2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate), which through an unknown mechanism, activates CAMTA3 (Calmodulin biding transcriptional activator 3) inducing transcription of bZIP60. 2. BiP ER luminal proteins bind unfolded proteins. The buildup of unfolded proteins leads to activation of IRE1 mediated splicing of bZIP60, which is then potentially ligated by the RNA ligase RLG1. The spliced bZIP60 is a nuclear localized transcription factor which binds to promoters of downstream UPR target genes, Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) although not depicted here, regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. 3. bZIP28 after being freed from BiPs by the presence of unfolded proteins is trafficked to the Golgi in a SAR1a/SEC23-dependent way. S2P proteases cleave the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain. bZIP28 enters the nucleus and acts redundantly with bZIP60 to transcriptionally activate the UPR.Evidence that plant IRE1 assumes other roles besides the splicing of bZIP60, including RIDD and/or other yet-unknown activities of IRE1, can be found when comparing the stress responsive and vegetative phenotypic differences between IRE1 and bZIP60 loss-of-function mutants in Arabidopsis. Although no other direct splicing substrate has been found for IRE1 activity other that bZIP60 in plants, bzip60 knockout mutants are not nearly as sensitive as the ire1a/ire1b mutant to prolonged ER stress (Deng, et al. 2013, Mishiba, et al. 2013), implying diverse roles of IRE1 during the UPR. Whether these may depend on the ability of IRE1 to phosphorylate other substrates as opposed to its ribonuclease domain is a tantalizing idea that is yet to be experimentally tested. Furthermore, bzip60 plants are apparently indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal conditions of growth, while IRE1 partial loss of function mutants (ire1a/ire1b) display shorter root growth as developmental defects, and ire1 null mutations are lethal (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013, Lu and Christopher 2008). Comparative analyses between bzip60 and ire1a/ire1b mutants under stressed and unstressed conditions may yet yield information that could potentially explain these physiological differences and provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which tie IRE1 specifically to the control of plant health and cell fate decisions.bZIP60 Although seemingly unimportant when compared with IRE1 or redundant when compared with other UPR signal transducers like bZIP28 (Sun et al. 2013a) in conditions tested thus far, bZIP60 appears to have unique contributions to the UPR management. Indeed, a close examination of the ER molecular phenotypes associated with bzip60 knockouts and expression patterns of bZIP60 yields some interesting information. The unspliced version of bZIP60 encodes a membrane bound transcription factor, and while it is found to be transcribed under normal conditions, the accumulation of the protein encoded by unspliced bZIP60 has been debated (Iwata et al. 2008, Iwata et al. 2009, Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). Although methods of detection between studies have been different, it has been shown that the product of the unspliced bZIP60 isoform accumulates to higher levels in seedlings treated with a proteasome inhibitor compared to untreated seedlings (Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). When this is taken into context with the observation that a cellular recycling process known as macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is constitutively active in the bzip60 knockout (Liu et al. 2012), it could be hypothesized that the dynamic levels of unspliced bZIP60 products are post-translationally subject to selective protein degradation and may regulate aspects of ER homeostasis, including protection of the ER against autophagy. bZIP60 has also been shown to be transcriptionally regulated in conditions outside of the canonical UPR as well. In chloroplasts, reductive potential is funneled into carbon fixation and the synthesis of long carbon chains through the plastid isoprenoid metabolic pathway, collectively known as the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014). This biosynthetic track produces numerous molecular-end products, which range in function from growth and development (e.g., gibberellin precursors) to synthesis of isoprene gas, which protects chloroplast under heat stress (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014, Hedden and Thomas 2012, Sharkey 2005). Retrograde stress signaling mechanisms from chloroplasts to nucleus utilize the buildup of the MEP pathway intermediate methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) in an abiotic stress dependent manner (Xiao et al. 2012). The CEH1 (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl4-diphosphate synthase) enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of MEcPP to hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate (HMBPP) is dependent upon reductive potential of NADPH from the light reactions and, as a result, the activity of CEH1 is known to be oxidative stress sensitive (Ostrovsky et al. 1998). Fascinatingly, the MEcPP retrograde signal, transmitted in a calcium-dependent way via the calmodulin binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3), leads directly to transcriptional induction of bZIP60 (Benn et al. 2016). The possibility that the UPR responds to plastid metabolic dysfunction may also indicate that, like in humans (Ron and Walter 2007), the UPR may have tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming functions that have gone unnoticed in plants. This intracellular organelle bridge deserves further scrutiny, and its connection to the observations made by Ozgur et al. (2015) in their study of UPR activation under oxidative stress cannot be understated. When sourced from different organelles, ROS had highly variable effects in stimulating expression of some UPR genes while repressing others (e.g. methyl viologen induces BiP3 expression but heavily repressed BiP2 expression). Although bZIP60 expression and splicing have yet to be tracked under these conditions, this information could help identify mechanisms for selective upregulation or downregulation of UPR genes. This is especially valuable given that current studies of the two arms of the plant UPR are most often considered in the context of coordinated upregulation of UPR genes (Nagashima et al. 2014).bZIP28 The ER transmembrane transcription factor bZIP28 is released from binding to BiP chaperones and is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus where putative site 1 and site 2 protease (S1P and S2P)-mediated proteolytic mechanisms split the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain and allow its relocation to the nucleus (Gao et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2007, Srivastava et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013c, Sun et al. 2015). Once in the nucleus the activated bZIP28 forms protein complexes with NF-Y transcription factors, and together bind specific ER stress related cis-elements (ERSE), which consist of two consensus sequences separated by 10 nucleotides (CCAAT-N10-CACG) and are commonly found in UPR upregulated gene promoter regions (Liu et al. 2010). Looking beyond the functions of bZIP28 in the nucleus, recent work has elucidated the mechanisms by which bZIP28 is shuttled to the Golgi apparatus in an ER stress dependent fashion. In exploring the functional diversity of the COPII components involved in ER export, Zeng et al. (2015) mapped the biochemical interactions necessary for proper transfer of bZIP28 to the Golgi apparatus under ER stress. ER-to-Golgi transport is mediated by a specialized protein machinery collectively known COPII (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2014). Assembly of this machinery requires SAR1, a GTPase that in the active form recruits the COPII coat components, SEC23/Sec24 and SEC13/SEC31. These components are required for cargo selection at the ER and shuttling to the Golgi. Although SAR1a shares high sequence identity to other secretion associated RAS-related GTPase homologs of the SAR1-family in Arabidopsis (Hanton et al. 2008), a single cysteine residue substitution at the amino acid position 84 was found to be required for interaction with SEC23a (Zeng et al. 2015). A dominant negative allele of SAR1a impaired the export of bZIP28 from the ER to the Golgi under tunicamycin-induced stress in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In contrast with other SAR1 and SEC23 homologs in Arabidopsis, the SAR1a/SEC23a pair is transcriptionally induced under ER stress conditions (Song et al. 2013). As such they may play an important role in promoting and sustaining the activity of bZIP28 during ER stress. This also opens up avenues to explore other conditions which could promote condition-specific trafficking of bZIP28, and subsequently potential activation of bZIP28 in developmental or growth contexts without activation of the canonical UPR cascade. This may be especially impactful with respect to bZIP28 functions in promoting brassinosteroid (BR) sensitivity (Che et al. 2010). S1P-S2P mediated cleavage of bZIP28 and another bZIP-transcription factor (bZIP17) under ER stress promote active BR signaling in adaptation to abiotic stress responses (Che et al. 2010). Although this phenomenon is presumed to be result of ERQC upregulation and increased delivery of functional client protein BRI1 sensor to the cell surface (Gendron and Wang 2007, Jin et al. 2007, Hong et al. 2008, Jin et al. 2009, Che et al. 2010), the exact mechanism through which bZIP28 and bZIP17 positively impact BR signaling remains to be discovered.Future Exploration: bZIP60 and bZIP28 mediate Epigenetic Modifications with the COMPASS like Complex In contrast with the single bzip60 and bzip28 mutants, the bzip60 bzip28 double mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to prolonged ER stress (Deng et al. 2013), indicating both functional redundancy and potential cooperativity. Under ER stress conditions both bZIP60 and bZIP28 localize to the nucleus and have been shown to interact with each other to modulate the expression of UPR genes (Song et al. 2015). The recent findings implicating bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the direction of histone methylation activities of the COMPASS complex presents interesting opportunities for further study. In plants the COMPASS complex is responsible for increasing the frequency of trimethylation of histone 3 in the promoter region of actively expressed genes through association with an unidentified histone methyltransferase (Jiang et al. 2011). Previously, although there was strong evidence supporting the correlation between H3K4 histone trimethylation and gene transcription, no mechanisms were known to direct these epigenetic modifications in sequence-specific ways in plants (Li et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). However, Song et al. (2015) showed that bZIP60 and bZIP28 interact with the proteins Ash2 (absent, small, homeotic like factor 2) and WDR5a (WD40 containing repeat 5a), which form the core elements of the COMPASS complex in plants (Jiang et al. 2011). Furthermore, the inducible expression of a subset of UPR responsive genes during ER stress was dramatically compromised in the wdr5a and ash2 mutants (Song et al. 2015). The lasting effects of these epigenetic marks after ER stress are not clear, but H3K4 trimethylation marks accumulate on genes involved in heat stress memory (Lämke et al. 2015). This may indicate that the UPR plays an important role in priming plants against future environmental stresses. Furthermore, H3K4 methylation and the COMPASS complex also play important roles in mediating temperature sensitive transitions in plant development (Jiang et al. 2011, Kumar and Wigge 2010, Zilberman et al. 2008). Exploring how UPR stress signaling and the constitutive functions of UPR related genes integrate with these epigenetic regulating mechanisms through bZIP28 and particularly bZIP60 might also provide useful insights into the developmental phenotypes found in ire1a/ire1b (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013), which are deficient in bZIP60 splicing. Send in the Cavalry: Downstream Effectors during ER Stress Nuclear translocation of spliced bZIP60 and cleaved bZIP28 leads to an increase in the transcription of genes coding for ER luminal proteins (BiP/Hsp70, ERdj/HSP40, HSP90), which (i) prevent aggregation of misfolded protein and newly translated polypeptides (Gupta et al. 2011), (ii) limit uncontrolled folding of nascent polypeptides through ERQC, and (iii) translocate terminally misfolded proteins across the ER membrane to the 26S proteasome by a group of membrane bound complexes in a processes collectively termed ER associated degradation (ERAD-L, -M and –C for luminal, membrane, and cytoplasmic ERAD, respectively (Olzmann et al. 2013). These downstream effectors, although largely conserved across eukaryotes, have been found to have specific significance in plants during normal growth and in response to ER stress (Klein et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2009). A noteworthy example of this is provided in the study of the plant specific properties of the conserved ER luminal chaperone HSP90.7, also known in Arabidopsis as SHEPHERD (SHD) (Ishiguro et al. 2002). When compared to the non-selective foldase activities of its mammalian counterpart GRP94, the designation of HSP90.7 as a general ER chaperone in plants (like BiP/HSP70) has been questioned (Klein et al. 2006, Marzec et al. 2012). In particular, Arabidopsis HSP90.7 which is highly upregulated under ER stress conditions was also found to have specific functions in proliferating tissues (Ishiguro et al. 2002, Klein et al. 2006). The shd (hsp90.7) knockout mutant is phenotypically identical to clv a mutant defective in CLAVATA signaling, a critical negative modulator of shoot apical meristem activity, indicating it may be required for plant specific production of the CLAVATA peptide (Aichinger et al. 2012, Miwa et al. 2009). Additional plant specific activities of HSP90.7 were demonstrated by Chong et al.(2014) who found that a short sequence of highly charged amino acids present only in plant ER-localized homologs drastically affected the survival rates of Arabidopsis seedlings under tunicamycin - and high calcium- induced ER stress. As expected overexpression of the HSP90.7 chaperone conferred significant resistance to tunicamycin, heat and high calcium induced ER stress; conversely overexpression of an HSP90.7 mutant with the highly charged 22 residue sequence deleted (HSP90.7Δ22 ), while still more resistant to heat stress than wild type, showed a marked increase in lethality in response to tunicamicyn compared to both native HSP90.7 overexpressor plants and even wild-type plants. These observations beyond illustrating plant specific chaperone functions also provide an important example which implies that in plants tunicamycin-induced stress may be responded to in a manner that is separate from heat induced ER stresses. Furthermore, it may be possible that the UPR directly mediates meristematic growth within undifferentiated tissues themselves through the HSP90.7/ CLAVATA relationship, perhaps in combination with transmission of signals through secondary messengers from distant tissues. Further examples of UPR effectors which have plant-specific roles in growth and development can also be found with respect to ERdj3 (ER resident J domain 3) protein function during gametophyte development (Yamamoto et al. 2008). J domain proteins (Hsp40) found in the ER lumen bind BiP proteins and stabilize their interactions with client unfolded proteins (Misselwitz et al. 1998, Yamamoto et al. 2008). ERdj3A, which is induced under ER stress, contains a C-terminal protein disulfide isomerase domain that has reductive capabilities on substrates in vitro (Yang et al. 2009), in addition to a HSP40 ATPase activity (Ma et al. 2015). This suggests that ERdj3A may act on a specific subset of client proteins. Further in vivo analysis of ERdj3A and its homologs ERdj3B and P58IPK support this possibility by demonstrating their importance in development (Maruyama et al. 2014b). Indeed, genetic analysis of the mutant Thermosensitive male sterile 1 (tms1) revealed a nonfunctional allele of ERdj3A that under elevated temperatures was defective in pollen tube growth (Yang et al. 2009). Under normal conditions, in conjunction with P58IPK and ERdj3b, ERdj3A was also shown to mediate polar haploid nuclei fusion in female gametophytes (Maruyama et al. 2014b) prior to double fertilization. During this nuclear fusion process, the perinuclear ER fuses with the outer nuclear envelope and creates a continuous outer membrane around the two haploid nuclei, and it is followed by a second fusion of the inner nuclear membranes (Jensen 1964, Maruyama et al. 2010). Recently it was demonstrated that ERdj3A and P58IPK are required for the fusion of the ER membrane with the outer nuclear membranes. A double knockout (erdj3a p58IPK) resulted in seed abortion after fertilization due to aberrant endosperm proliferation, similar to that found in bip1 bip2 double mutants (Maruyama et al. 2010, Maruyama et al. 2014b). The inner membrane fusion requires the ERdj3B/ P58IPK pair, and although the erdj3b p58 IPK double mutants had unfused haploid nuclei in close proximity, unlike erdj3a p58IPK no aborted seeds were found (Maruyama et al. 2014a). The developmental defects found in plants with mutant alleles of UPR induced ER resident proteins (e.g., ERdj, BiP, SHD) are consistent with the evidence that pollen development in an ire1a ire1b double mutant is highly vulnerable to heat stress (Deng et al. 2016, Fragkostefanakis et al. 2016). However, the observed rescue of male fertility through the overexpression of a single COPII coat component SEC31a is intriguing given the large gene list shown to be regulated by IRE1 in these conditions (Deng et al. 2016). This underscores the need to fully understand the detailed functional mechanisms of downstream UPR components. Although studies exploring the similarities between yeast, mammalian, and plant UPR have led to significant advances in plant ER stress research, in order to fully understand the mechanisms connecting the UPR to plant specific physiology it will also be important to look at the contrasting characteristics. These plant specific cases, such as the single amino acid substitution in the case of SAR1a important for bZIP28 shuttling (Zeng et al. 2015), or the small charged region in the case of HSP90.7, which drastically alters stress responsive phenotypes compared to the deletion mutant (Chong et al. 2014), are potent reminders to expect the unexpected, even in evolutionarily conserved contexts. NAC Membrane Transcription Factors: A Second Set of UPR activators? In addition to the transcriptional activities of bZIP60 and bZIP28, a veritable menagerie of plant-specific transcription factors is involved in the response to ER stress (Figure 2) (Sun et al. 2013b, Yang et al. 2014a, Yang et al. 2014b). Thus far however, their mechanistic involvement in the UPR is yet to be fully elucidated. ANAC062 a plasma membrane-bound transcription factor, which is proteolytically cleaved and nuclear localized in response to cold stress, has been linked to the expression of multiple pathogenesis-related genes in a salicylic acid independent fashion and has also been shown to be upregulated under ER stress (Seo et al. 2010). Overexpression of a truncated form lacking the C-terminal membrane domain was shown to induce canonical UPR responsive chaperones and improve prolonged ER stress outcomes (Yang et al. 2014b), supporting a functional connection between ANAC062 and the UPR. Furthermore, ANAC103, a soluble nuclear transcription factor was shown to be transcriptionally induced under ER stress (Sun et al. 2013b). Overexpression of ANAC103 with a small C-terminal deletion to enhance stability of the expressed protein was also shown to induce UPR genes, although true knockouts showed no appreciable ER stress phenotype suggesting a functional redundancy between ANAC103 and other UPR related transcription factors in response to tunicamycin (Sun et al. 2013b). A third transcription factor, the membrane bound ANAC089, has been implicated in promoting programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. Inducible overexpression of truncated ANAC089 ignited mammalian apoptotic-like symptoms in roots (Yang et al. 2014a). RNAi lines targeting ANAC089 also displayed resistance to tunicamycin induced ER stress (Yang et al. 2014a). These results support earlier findings implicating ANAC089 in the control of ER-related homeostatic mechanisms. Smyczynsk et al. (2006) in their study of a conserved immunophilin peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase PASTICCINO1 (PAS1) demonstrated through a series of biochemical experiments that PAS1 and ANAC089 (which they termed FAN, for FKBP associated NAC) interact in vivo and in vitro (Smyczynski et al. 2006). PAS1 is important in maintaining proper morphology during embryo development in Arabidopsis (Vittorioso et al. 1998). Expressed in response to cytokinin, ER-localized PAS1 associates with the VLCFA (very long chain fatty acid) synthesis complex and promotes sphingolipid biosynthesis and subsequently organ polarity through the lipids effect on the localization of the PIN1 efflux carrier (Roudier et al. 2010). A C-terminal domain of PAS1 is required for interaction and co-localization with ANAC089 (Smyczynski et al. 2006). That same domain is also required for nuclear exclusion of the PAS1. Interestingly, both PAS1 and ANAC089 are highly expressed in the mature embryo and were found to relocate from ER to the nucleus dependent upon exogenous 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatment during cellular dedifferentiation in Arabidopsis root tips (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When overexpressed in the pas1 loss of function allele, the full-length ANAC089 resulted in partial complementation of the deformed growth phenotype (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When this is taken into account in the context of the RNAi knockdowns of ANAC089 under ER stress, it may be possible that the reduction of endogenous ANAC89 may perturb cytokinin-auxin balance in a manner that promotes cell divisions in spite of continued stress signals. Taken together, these ANAC transcription factors may indeed play important roles in the secondary activation of the UPR cascade; they might also play important roles in activation of the UPR in response to other stress or hormone signaling mechanisms. For example, in a manner opposite STT3a which seems to prevent the activation of the UPR in salt stress conditions (Koiwa et al. 2003), perhaps plants treated with tunicamycin in cold conditions may require NAC062 for full UPR gene expression regulation as cold signaling mechanisms may interfere with canonical activation of IRE1 or bZIP28. Expansion of combinatorial stress experiments incorporating tunicamycin-induced stress with other environmental stressors may give a more accurate picture of regulation, and downstream targets of these transcription factors. This may consequently lead to more information regarding the in vivo function of the unmodified transcription factors in relation to the unfolded protein response. Figure 2. UPR-regulated Transcription Factors may Tailor UPR Activation to Specific Stress Combinations. Open in a new tab Several plant-specific transcription factors are upregulated under ER stress in an IRE1/bZIP28 dependent way. Two membrane-bound transcription factors, ANAC062 and ANAC089, have been shown to relocate to the nucleus under ER stress. ANAC062 also is nuclear localized under cold stress conditions. ANAC089 along with interactor PAS1 (PASTICCINO1) were also shown to relocate to the nucleus in roots treated with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid to induce dedifferentiation. ANAC103, a soluble transcription factor, was also shown to upregulate UPR genes upon over expression. Although truncated forms of these transcription factors were shown to upregulate UPR responsive genes, the molecular mechanisms of action of native transcription factors are still unknown. After upregulation by IRE1/bZIP28 dependent mechanisms, these transcription factors may respond to secondary signals which reinforce or alter UPR gene expression.",

In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life. Keywords: Unfolded protein response, ER stress, IRE1, bZIP60, bZIP28, Arabidopsis thalianaIntroduction As the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to secretory pathway (Vitale and Denecke 1999), the primary site of phospholipid synthesis (Ohlrogge and Browse 1995), a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules (Light et al. 2016, Ron and Walter 2007, Shore et al. 2011), and the assembly plant for a third of a cell's total proteome (Wallin and Heijne 1998), interruptions in its functions can have vast consequences in cellular health. Under physiological conditions of growth, a dedicated battery of ER-resident proteins can prevent misfolding of nascent polypeptides and facilitate acquisition of the proper tertiary structure through post-translational modification (e.g., covalent addition of oligosaccharide chains or catalysis of disulfide bond formation) (Dobson 2003, Gupta and Tuteja 2011). In plants affected by environmental stress (e.g. heat stress (Gidalevitz et al. 2011)), proper folding of secretory proteins can be impaired and misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress (Dobson 2003, Hartl and Haver-Hartl 2009, Buchberger et al 2010). Indeed, under prolonged or severe levels of stress, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins can become cytotoxic and lead to death of the plant cell in a manner akin to the effect of misfolded proteins that aggregate and cause human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hoozemans et al. 2005). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms designed to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Specialized ER-localized membrane proteins are able to detect the buildup of unfolded proteins and activate signaling cascades that modulate the abundance of the proteins dedicated to the folding of nascent polypeptides within the ER to maintain homeostasis (Ron and Walter 2007, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015). In metazoans the ER-localized stress sensor array consists of the Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and Protein kinase R-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) (Harding et al. 1999, Shen et al. 2002, Wang et al. 1998). In plants, the functional homologs of IRE1 and ATF6 (termed IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 in Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified to date (Iwata and Koizumi 2012). In yeast, only the IRE1-dependent UPR pathway has been identified (Ron and Walter 2007, Mori 2009). A number of comparative reviews have highlighted the similarities between UPR components shared among plants, metazoans and yeast, and should be referred to for greater contexts on the depth of gene conservation shared by all eukaryotes in regards to UPR-related mechanisms (Chen and Brandizzi 2013, Liu and Howell 2016, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015). The study of the UPR in human and animal models largely centers on genetic defects that allow the buildup of misfolded proteins, and mitigating the cytotoxic effects of the resulting aggregates (Rao and Bredesen 2004, Stefani and Dobson 2003). In plants, UPR research also focuses on improving crop yield under adverse environmental conditions. There is a large potential for biotechnological applications for UPR-related mechanisms in ensuring plant productivity. However, considerable work must be done to understand how the UPR is integrated into intra and intercellular signaling mechanisms that are plant specific. Even though there is considerable evidence to suggest that the UPR components are required for many different aspects of plant physiology, from seed germination to meristematic maintenance (Barba-Espín et al. 2014, Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Chen et al. 2014, Deng et al. 2013, Klein et al. 2006, Deng et al. 2016, Meng et al. 2016), we are only beginning to connect the molecular activities of IRE1 and bZIP28 to the modulation of organism growth and development. In this review, we provide a summary of causative ER stress conditions followed by an examination of UPR signaling pathways through a discussion of recent advancements in the field. Given space constraints, this review focuses mainly on UPR studies in the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Throughout, we draw attention of the reader to new developments in the context of plant growth, development, and metabolic functioning. This is done in an attempt to move beyond a classical linear signal transduction paradigm, and visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life. ER Quality Control and Important ER Client Proteins Mediate both Programmed Cell Death and Cell Cycle Control If the plant cell was reimagined as a city, it would be easy to see how the ER could be described as the town's central factory. At the ER, shipments of raw materials in the form of amino acids and carbohydrates are reshaped and assembled into fully-functional molecular machines in the form of proteins. Properly folded proteins are then shipped out and utilized for a variety of different purposes in different places throughout or outside the cell. In order to prevent the production of faulty goods, the ER has specific machinery, collectively called ER quality control (ERQC), to survey the protein folding status, facilitate folding and ensure quality of the produced protein. The production of most secretory proteins begins with the co-translational introduction of the protein into the ER. In this process, specific peptide sequences target nascent polypeptide chains to the ER and are translocated across the membrane as they are synthesized via the Sec translocon, which is largely conserved between yeast and plants (Akopian et al. 2013, Denecke et al. 1992, Deneke et al. 1993, Schweiger and Schenkert 2013). As the polypeptide enters the ER lumen, molecular chaperones such as the luminal binding proteins (BiPs), bind to the chain of the nascent polypeptides and prevent premature folding (Carvalho et al. 2014, Foresti et al. 2003). The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Lerouxel et al. 2005) recognizes specific amino acid sequences and transfers N-linked glycans to the peptides. In some cases, this post translational modification adds to the intrinsic stability or solubility of a protein, and importantly, it functions as a recognition beacon for major ER luminal foldase complexes (Sinclair and Elliott 2005). Nascent polypeptides undergo iterative folding cycles where they are passed between the calnexin/calreticulin complex, and UDP-glucose glycoprotein-glucosyltransferase (UGGT), which monitor protein folding and retains unfolded proteins in the ER (Totani et al., 2009) as a part of the ERQC. Other proteins participate in folding cycles under the purview of these central ER foldase complexes, such as thioredoxins (e.g protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs)), which catalyze the reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds (Bottomley et al. 2001, Wilkinson and Gilbert 2004). Properly folded proteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, while the unfolded or irremediably misfolded proteins are picked up by proteins like OS9 of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, dislocated out of the ER, ubiquitinated, and finally degraded by the 26S proteasome (Huttner et al. 2012). The process is conserved across eukaryotes and, for example, it mediates the proper folding of critical client plasma membrane receptor proteins in plants, including the Arabidopsis elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor which mediates pathogen associated molecular pattern based immunity (Li et al. 2009) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) receptor (Li and Chory 1997). Although not directly related to the activation of the UPR, the essential physiological relevance of these folding processes, which are monitored by the UPR regulators (via unfolded protein accumulation), are continuously being demonstrated. Beyond enabling proper function of cellular signaling pathways with receptors at the plasma membrane (like EF-Tu and BRI1), the specificity of N-linked glycosylation-bearing proteins has recently been shown to play important roles in regulating cell death. The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) and SERK4 (somatic embryo receptor kinase 4) both interact with immune receptors and BRI1 and negatively regulate hypersensitive response-like programmed cell death (PCD) through yet-unknown mechanisms (Gou et al. 2012, Li et al. 2002, Nam and Li 2002, Roux et al. 2011). Intriguingly, loss of STT3a (staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3), one of the two catalytic subunits of the OST complex involved in N-glycosylation of ER proteins, is linked to the cell death phenotype observed in BAK1/SERK4 silenced plants (de Oliveira et al. 2016). However, UPR deficient mutants did not respond differently to BAK1/SERK1 silencing, which led to the conclusion that UPR regulators IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 may not modulate this specific type of PCD (de Oliveira et al. 2016). When examined under salt stress conditions, a stt3a knockout line showed UPR activation and halted cell cycle progression in a similar manner to that described in yeast and mammalian cells after being subjected to ER stress-inducing conditions (Arnold and Tanner 1982, Brewer et al. 1999, Koiwa et al. 2003). This may suggest a possible antagonistic role between STT3a and the UPR components, or may simply indicate that the proteins needed to adapt to salt stress may be glycosylated in order to fold or function properly. In both cases, although the UPR may not directly regulate the expression of BAK1/SERK4 or N-glycosylated salt protective genes, these examples underscore the importance of maintaining the ER as a fully-functional protein folding factory so a plant may adapt to various sources of stresses.The Causes of ER Stress: Unavoidable Exogenous Threats Enhancing the UPR appears potentially critical to efforts to maintain crop productivity by priming plants to survive under adverse environmental conditions (Valente et al. 2009, Carvalho et al. 2014, Luan et al. 2016 Xiang et al. 2016). One of the most thoroughly described environmental UPR inducer is heat stress (Deng et al. 2011, Duke and Doehlert 1996, Gao et al. 2008, Schmollinger et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2009). More conveniently than heat conditions in the lab, chemical UPR inducers such as tunicamycin, which inhibits the N-linked glycosylation in the ER lumen, are often used to investigate the UPR in many eukaryotic model organisms by mimicking the conditions associated with environmental stresses that cause the buildup of unfolded proteins. Extreme osmotic stress and heavy metals such as selenium have also shown to induce the UPR (Liu et al. 2007, Van Hoewyk 2016). The UPR also plays a role in response to pathogens and other biotic stresses (Moreno et al. 2012, Prasch and Sonnewald 2013, Zhang et al. 2015). Through an unknown mechanism, treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the biotic stress-hormone salicylic acid (SA) was shown to activate both arms of the UPR controlled by IRE1 and bZIP28 (Moreno et al. 2012, Nagashima et al. 2014). This SA-induced UPR activation was also given context by Meng et al. (2016), which showed that the SA-accumulating cpr5 (Constitutive Expression of PR genes 5) mutant is dependent on the UPR to suppress growth. Other studies have demonstrated the interesting effect of organelle sourced reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. plastids and mitochondria) on the induction of the UPR (Ozgur et al. 2015) suggesting a possible functional connection between the UPR and non-secretory organelles. It was demonstrated that plastid-originated ROS production induced UPR activation suggesting that plastidial stress may be intimately linked with, and responded to, through the ER stress signal transduction mechanisms (Ozgur et al. 2015). Given the close connections between SA and ROS signaling (Torres et al. 2006, Mou et al. 2003), these observations may indicate a functional link between the two UPR activating conditions.The Canonical Response to Unfolded Proteins: New Look at the Master Regulators IRE1, bZIP60, and bZIP28 IRE1 In environmentally stressful conditions, the accumulation of unfolded and irremediably misfolded proteins leads to the activation of the UPR via IRE1 and bZIP28 (Figure 1). Although the activation mechanism of IRE1 has yet to be established in plants, studies of IRE1 in yeast have indicated that BiP binds the IRE1 luminal domain in non-stressful conditions. However, upon stress, BiP chaperones preferentially bind unfolded proteins thereby freeing the ER luminal domains of IRE1 (Pincus et al. 2010). Unfolded proteins then bind to IRE1 (Gardner and Walter 2011) which oligomerizes; as a consequence, the kinase domain in the cytosolic portion of the protein is autophosphorylated (Shamu and Walter 1996, Welihinda and Kaufman 1996). These steps lead to activation of the IRE1 ribonuclease domain (Cox and Walter 1996). In mammalian cells misfolded proteins bind to BiP chaperones which keep IRE1 in an inactive monomeric state under normal conditions (Berlotti et al. 2000). After dissociation from BiP, interactions between the freed luminal domains of IRE1 bring cytoplasmic domains together allowing the necessary autophosphorylation (Credle et al. 2005, Ali et al. 2011). Although the underlying mechanisms for activation of plant IRE1 are not known, it is certain that activation of IRE1 results in the unconventional cytosolic splicing of the mRNA transcripts of bZIP60, the only UPR target of plant IRE1 known to date (Deng, et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011, Hayashi et al. 2012, Lu et al. 2012, Li et al. 2012 Moreno et al. 2012). In Arabidopsis, the tRNA ligase RLG1 was recently shown to complete the splicing of bZIP60 in vitro by ligating the fragments derived from IRE1 cleavage (Nagashima et al. 2016). Whether the ligation of bZIP60 spliced transcripts is mediated by RLG1 in vivo, while likely, has yet to be experimentally demonstrated, partly due to the lethality of complete RLG1 loss-of-function mutations (Nagashima et al. 2016). In yeast and mammalian cells, the ligation of the functional equivalents of bZIP60, Hac1 and XbpI, respectively, occurs via tRNA ligases that operate in opposite fashion. In detail, the ligation of Hac1 mediated by RLG1p in yeast is completed in a 5’-3’ fashion followed by removal of 2` phosphate group by a phosphatase (Sawaya et al. 2003, Steiger et al. 2005). In mammalian cells, the ligation is mediated by RTCB, which operates in a 3’-5’ ligation (Jurkin et al. 2014). Evidence suggests that plants have evolved a 5’-3’ ligation mechanism similar to that found in yeast, and this finding is supported by observations that Arabidopsis RLG1 can also ligate the Hac1 mRNA in yeast cells (Mori et al. 2010). However, the resulting Hac1 transcripts are not efficiently translated indicating that functional differences between yeast and Arabidopsis catalytic mechanisms remain. The splicing of bZIP60 leads to a frameshift that removes a transmembrane domain from the translated transcription factor. Spliced bZIP60 subsequently translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional modulation of the downstream UPR target genes. Intriguingly, the activity of IRE1 is not limited to unconventional splicing of a transcription factor. Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) is a process which regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. Such IRE1 mediated cleavage of cytosolic and ER-associated mRNAs has been implicated in promoting cell death in yeast (Tam et al. 2014). In metazoans, RIDD activity under prolonged or severe ER stress also has proapoptotic effects, and can be associated with human diseases such as diabetes (Maurel et al. 2014, Hetz and Glimcher 2011). RIDD activity was also described for the Arabidopsis IRE1 homolog (Mishiba et al. 2013), although the implications related to stress outcomes are yet to be tested in vivo. Figure 1. Mechanisms of the plant UPR activation. Open in a new tab Environmental stresses (e.g. heat, oxidative stress, selenium, chemical inhibitors) negatively affect the protein folding process, leading to the buildup of unfolded proteins. Plastid stress promotes the buildup of MEcPP (2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate), which through an unknown mechanism, activates CAMTA3 (Calmodulin biding transcriptional activator 3) inducing transcription of bZIP60. 2. BiP ER luminal proteins bind unfolded proteins. The buildup of unfolded proteins leads to activation of IRE1 mediated splicing of bZIP60, which is then potentially ligated by the RNA ligase RLG1. The spliced bZIP60 is a nuclear localized transcription factor which binds to promoters of downstream UPR target genes, Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) although not depicted here, regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. 3. bZIP28 after being freed from BiPs by the presence of unfolded proteins is trafficked to the Golgi in a SAR1a/SEC23-dependent way. S2P proteases cleave the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain. bZIP28 enters the nucleus and acts redundantly with bZIP60 to transcriptionally activate the UPR.Evidence that plant IRE1 assumes other roles besides the splicing of bZIP60, including RIDD and/or other yet-unknown activities of IRE1, can be found when comparing the stress responsive and vegetative phenotypic differences between IRE1 and bZIP60 loss-of-function mutants in Arabidopsis. Although no other direct splicing substrate has been found for IRE1 activity other that bZIP60 in plants, bzip60 knockout mutants are not nearly as sensitive as the ire1a/ire1b mutant to prolonged ER stress (Deng, et al. 2013, Mishiba, et al. 2013), implying diverse roles of IRE1 during the UPR. Whether these may depend on the ability of IRE1 to phosphorylate other substrates as opposed to its ribonuclease domain is a tantalizing idea that is yet to be experimentally tested. Furthermore, bzip60 plants are apparently indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal conditions of growth, while IRE1 partial loss of function mutants (ire1a/ire1b) display shorter root growth as developmental defects, and ire1 null mutations are lethal (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013, Lu and Christopher 2008). Comparative analyses between bzip60 and ire1a/ire1b mutants under stressed and unstressed conditions may yet yield information that could potentially explain these physiological differences and provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which tie IRE1 specifically to the control of plant health and cell fate decisions.bZIP60 Although seemingly unimportant when compared with IRE1 or redundant when compared with other UPR signal transducers like bZIP28 (Sun et al. 2013a) in conditions tested thus far, bZIP60 appears to have unique contributions to the UPR management. Indeed, a close examination of the ER molecular phenotypes associated with bzip60 knockouts and expression patterns of bZIP60 yields some interesting information. The unspliced version of bZIP60 encodes a membrane bound transcription factor, and while it is found to be transcribed under normal conditions, the accumulation of the protein encoded by unspliced bZIP60 has been debated (Iwata et al. 2008, Iwata et al. 2009, Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). Although methods of detection between studies have been different, it has been shown that the product of the unspliced bZIP60 isoform accumulates to higher levels in seedlings treated with a proteasome inhibitor compared to untreated seedlings (Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). When this is taken into context with the observation that a cellular recycling process known as macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is constitutively active in the bzip60 knockout (Liu et al. 2012), it could be hypothesized that the dynamic levels of unspliced bZIP60 products are post-translationally subject to selective protein degradation and may regulate aspects of ER homeostasis, including protection of the ER against autophagy. bZIP60 has also been shown to be transcriptionally regulated in conditions outside of the canonical UPR as well. In chloroplasts, reductive potential is funneled into carbon fixation and the synthesis of long carbon chains through the plastid isoprenoid metabolic pathway, collectively known as the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014). This biosynthetic track produces numerous molecular-end products, which range in function from growth and development (e.g., gibberellin precursors) to synthesis of isoprene gas, which protects chloroplast under heat stress (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014, Hedden and Thomas 2012, Sharkey 2005). Retrograde stress signaling mechanisms from chloroplasts to nucleus utilize the buildup of the MEP pathway intermediate methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) in an abiotic stress dependent manner (Xiao et al. 2012). The CEH1 (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl4-diphosphate synthase) enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of MEcPP to hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate (HMBPP) is dependent upon reductive potential of NADPH from the light reactions and, as a result, the activity of CEH1 is known to be oxidative stress sensitive (Ostrovsky et al. 1998). Fascinatingly, the MEcPP retrograde signal, transmitted in a calcium-dependent way via the calmodulin binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3), leads directly to transcriptional induction of bZIP60 (Benn et al. 2016). The possibility that the UPR responds to plastid metabolic dysfunction may also indicate that, like in humans (Ron and Walter 2007), the UPR may have tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming functions that have gone unnoticed in plants. This intracellular organelle bridge deserves further scrutiny, and its connection to the observations made by Ozgur et al. (2015) in their study of UPR activation under oxidative stress cannot be understated. When sourced from different organelles, ROS had highly variable effects in stimulating expression of some UPR genes while repressing others (e.g. methyl viologen induces BiP3 expression but heavily repressed BiP2 expression). Although bZIP60 expression and splicing have yet to be tracked under these conditions, this information could help identify mechanisms for selective upregulation or downregulation of UPR genes. This is especially valuable given that current studies of the two arms of the plant UPR are most often considered in the context of coordinated upregulation of UPR genes (Nagashima et al. 2014).bZIP28 The ER transmembrane transcription factor bZIP28 is released from binding to BiP chaperones and is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus where putative site 1 and site 2 protease (S1P and S2P)-mediated proteolytic mechanisms split the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain and allow its relocation to the nucleus (Gao et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2007, Srivastava et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013c, Sun et al. 2015). Once in the nucleus the activated bZIP28 forms protein complexes with NF-Y transcription factors, and together bind specific ER stress related cis-elements (ERSE), which consist of two consensus sequences separated by 10 nucleotides (CCAAT-N10-CACG) and are commonly found in UPR upregulated gene promoter regions (Liu et al. 2010). Looking beyond the functions of bZIP28 in the nucleus, recent work has elucidated the mechanisms by which bZIP28 is shuttled to the Golgi apparatus in an ER stress dependent fashion. In exploring the functional diversity of the COPII components involved in ER export, Zeng et al. (2015) mapped the biochemical interactions necessary for proper transfer of bZIP28 to the Golgi apparatus under ER stress. ER-to-Golgi transport is mediated by a specialized protein machinery collectively known COPII (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2014). Assembly of this machinery requires SAR1, a GTPase that in the active form recruits the COPII coat components, SEC23/Sec24 and SEC13/SEC31. These components are required for cargo selection at the ER and shuttling to the Golgi. Although SAR1a shares high sequence identity to other secretion associated RAS-related GTPase homologs of the SAR1-family in Arabidopsis (Hanton et al. 2008), a single cysteine residue substitution at the amino acid position 84 was found to be required for interaction with SEC23a (Zeng et al. 2015). A dominant negative allele of SAR1a impaired the export of bZIP28 from the ER to the Golgi under tunicamycin-induced stress in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In contrast with other SAR1 and SEC23 homologs in Arabidopsis, the SAR1a/SEC23a pair is transcriptionally induced under ER stress conditions (Song et al. 2013). As such they may play an important role in promoting and sustaining the activity of bZIP28 during ER stress. This also opens up avenues to explore other conditions which could promote condition-specific trafficking of bZIP28, and subsequently potential activation of bZIP28 in developmental or growth contexts without activation of the canonical UPR cascade. This may be especially impactful with respect to bZIP28 functions in promoting brassinosteroid (BR) sensitivity (Che et al. 2010). S1P-S2P mediated cleavage of bZIP28 and another bZIP-transcription factor (bZIP17) under ER stress promote active BR signaling in adaptation to abiotic stress responses (Che et al. 2010). Although this phenomenon is presumed to be result of ERQC upregulation and increased delivery of functional client protein BRI1 sensor to the cell surface (Gendron and Wang 2007, Jin et al. 2007, Hong et al. 2008, Jin et al. 2009, Che et al. 2010), the exact mechanism through which bZIP28 and bZIP17 positively impact BR signaling remains to be discovered.Future Exploration: bZIP60 and bZIP28 mediate Epigenetic Modifications with the COMPASS like Complex In contrast with the single bzip60 and bzip28 mutants, the bzip60 bzip28 double mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to prolonged ER stress (Deng et al. 2013), indicating both functional redundancy and potential cooperativity. Under ER stress conditions both bZIP60 and bZIP28 localize to the nucleus and have been shown to interact with each other to modulate the expression of UPR genes (Song et al. 2015). The recent findings implicating bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the direction of histone methylation activities of the COMPASS complex presents interesting opportunities for further study. In plants the COMPASS complex is responsible for increasing the frequency of trimethylation of histone 3 in the promoter region of actively expressed genes through association with an unidentified histone methyltransferase (Jiang et al. 2011). Previously, although there was strong evidence supporting the correlation between H3K4 histone trimethylation and gene transcription, no mechanisms were known to direct these epigenetic modifications in sequence-specific ways in plants (Li et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). However, Song et al. (2015) showed that bZIP60 and bZIP28 interact with the proteins Ash2 (absent, small, homeotic like factor 2) and WDR5a (WD40 containing repeat 5a), which form the core elements of the COMPASS complex in plants (Jiang et al. 2011). Furthermore, the inducible expression of a subset of UPR responsive genes during ER stress was dramatically compromised in the wdr5a and ash2 mutants (Song et al. 2015). The lasting effects of these epigenetic marks after ER stress are not clear, but H3K4 trimethylation marks accumulate on genes involved in heat stress memory (Lämke et al. 2015). This may indicate that the UPR plays an important role in priming plants against future environmental stresses. Furthermore, H3K4 methylation and the COMPASS complex also play important roles in mediating temperature sensitive transitions in plant development (Jiang et al. 2011, Kumar and Wigge 2010, Zilberman et al. 2008). Exploring how UPR stress signaling and the constitutive functions of UPR related genes integrate with these epigenetic regulating mechanisms through bZIP28 and particularly bZIP60 might also provide useful insights into the developmental phenotypes found in ire1a/ire1b (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013), which are deficient in bZIP60 splicing.Send in the Cavalry: Downstream Effectors during ER Stress Nuclear translocation of spliced bZIP60 and cleaved bZIP28 leads to an increase in the transcription of genes coding for ER luminal proteins (BiP/Hsp70, ERdj/HSP40, HSP90), which (i) prevent aggregation of misfolded protein and newly translated polypeptides (Gupta et al. 2011), (ii) limit uncontrolled folding of nascent polypeptides through ERQC, and (iii) translocate terminally misfolded proteins across the ER membrane to the 26S proteasome by a group of membrane bound complexes in a processes collectively termed ER associated degradation (ERAD-L, -M and –C for luminal, membrane, and cytoplasmic ERAD, respectively (Olzmann et al. 2013). These downstream effectors, although largely conserved across eukaryotes, have been found to have specific significance in plants during normal growth and in response to ER stress (Klein et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2009). A noteworthy example of this is provided in the study of the plant specific properties of the conserved ER luminal chaperone HSP90.7, also known in Arabidopsis as SHEPHERD (SHD) (Ishiguro et al. 2002). When compared to the non-selective foldase activities of its mammalian counterpart GRP94, the designation of HSP90.7 as a general ER chaperone in plants (like BiP/HSP70) has been questioned (Klein et al. 2006, Marzec et al. 2012). In particular, Arabidopsis HSP90.7 which is highly upregulated under ER stress conditions was also found to have specific functions in proliferating tissues (Ishiguro et al. 2002, Klein et al. 2006). The shd (hsp90.7) knockout mutant is phenotypically identical to clv a mutant defective in CLAVATA signaling, a critical negative modulator of shoot apical meristem activity, indicating it may be required for plant specific production of the CLAVATA peptide (Aichinger et al. 2012, Miwa et al. 2009). Additional plant specific activities of HSP90.7 were demonstrated by Chong et al.(2014) who found that a short sequence of highly charged amino acids present only in plant ER-localized homologs drastically affected the survival rates of Arabidopsis seedlings under tunicamycin - and high calcium- induced ER stress. As expected overexpression of the HSP90.7 chaperone conferred significant resistance to tunicamycin, heat and high calcium induced ER stress; conversely overexpression of an HSP90.7 mutant with the highly charged 22 residue sequence deleted (HSP90.7Δ22 ), while still more resistant to heat stress than wild type, showed a marked increase in lethality in response to tunicamicyn compared to both native HSP90.7 overexpressor plants and even wild-type plants. These observations beyond illustrating plant specific chaperone functions also provide an important example which implies that in plants tunicamycin-induced stress may be responded to in a manner that is separate from heat induced ER stresses. Furthermore, it may be possible that the UPR directly mediates meristematic growth within undifferentiated tissues themselves through the HSP90.7/ CLAVATA relationship, perhaps in combination with transmission of signals through secondary messengers from distant tissues. Further examples of UPR effectors which have plant-specific roles in growth and development can also be found with respect to ERdj3 (ER resident J domain 3) protein function during gametophyte development (Yamamoto et al. 2008). J domain proteins (Hsp40) found in the ER lumen bind BiP proteins and stabilize their interactions with client unfolded proteins (Misselwitz et al. 1998, Yamamoto et al. 2008). ERdj3A, which is induced under ER stress, contains a C-terminal protein disulfide isomerase domain that has reductive capabilities on substrates in vitro (Yang et al. 2009), in addition to a HSP40 ATPase activity (Ma et al. 2015). This suggests that ERdj3A may act on a specific subset of client proteins. Further in vivo analysis of ERdj3A and its homologs ERdj3B and P58IPK support this possibility by demonstrating their importance in development (Maruyama et al. 2014b). Indeed, genetic analysis of the mutant Thermosensitive male sterile 1 (tms1) revealed a nonfunctional allele of ERdj3A that under elevated temperatures was defective in pollen tube growth (Yang et al. 2009). Under normal conditions, in conjunction with P58IPK and ERdj3b, ERdj3A was also shown to mediate polar haploid nuclei fusion in female gametophytes (Maruyama et al. 2014b) prior to double fertilization. During this nuclear fusion process, the perinuclear ER fuses with the outer nuclear envelope and creates a continuous outer membrane around the two haploid nuclei, and it is followed by a second fusion of the inner nuclear membranes (Jensen 1964, Maruyama et al. 2010). Recently it was demonstrated that ERdj3A and P58IPK are required for the fusion of the ER membrane with the outer nuclear membranes. A double knockout (erdj3a p58IPK) resulted in seed abortion after fertilization due to aberrant endosperm proliferation, similar to that found in bip1 bip2 double mutants (Maruyama et al. 2010, Maruyama et al. 2014b). The inner membrane fusion requires the ERdj3B/ P58IPK pair, and although the erdj3b p58 IPK double mutants had unfused haploid nuclei in close proximity, unlike erdj3a p58IPK no aborted seeds were found (Maruyama et al. 2014a). The developmental defects found in plants with mutant alleles of UPR induced ER resident proteins (e.g., ERdj, BiP, SHD) are consistent with the evidence that pollen development in an ire1a ire1b double mutant is highly vulnerable to heat stress (Deng et al. 2016, Fragkostefanakis et al. 2016). However, the observed rescue of male fertility through the overexpression of a single COPII coat component SEC31a is intriguing given the large gene list shown to be regulated by IRE1 in these conditions (Deng et al. 2016). This underscores the need to fully understand the detailed functional mechanisms of downstream UPR components. Although studies exploring the similarities between yeast, mammalian, and plant UPR have led to significant advances in plant ER stress research, in order to fully understand the mechanisms connecting the UPR to plant specific physiology it will also be important to look at the contrasting characteristics. These plant specific cases, such as the single amino acid substitution in the case of SAR1a important for bZIP28 shuttling (Zeng et al. 2015), or the small charged region in the case of HSP90.7, which drastically alters stress responsive phenotypes compared to the deletion mutant (Chong et al. 2014), are potent reminders to expect the unexpected, even in evolutionarily conserved contexts. NAC Membrane Transcription Factors: A Second Set of UPR activators? In addition to the transcriptional activities of bZIP60 and bZIP28, a veritable menagerie of plant-specific transcription factors is involved in the response to ER stress (Figure 2) (Sun et al. 2013b, Yang et al. 2014a, Yang et al. 2014b). Thus far however, their mechanistic involvement in the UPR is yet to be fully elucidated. ANAC062 a plasma membrane-bound transcription factor, which is proteolytically cleaved and nuclear localized in response to cold stress, has been linked to the expression of multiple pathogenesis-related genes in a salicylic acid independent fashion and has also been shown to be upregulated under ER stress (Seo et al. 2010). Overexpression of a truncated form lacking the C-terminal membrane domain was shown to induce canonical UPR responsive chaperones and improve prolonged ER stress outcomes (Yang et al. 2014b), supporting a functional connection between ANAC062 and the UPR. Furthermore, ANAC103, a soluble nuclear transcription factor was shown to be transcriptionally induced under ER stress (Sun et al. 2013b). Overexpression of ANAC103 with a small C-terminal deletion to enhance stability of the expressed protein was also shown to induce UPR genes, although true knockouts showed no appreciable ER stress phenotype suggesting a functional redundancy between ANAC103 and other UPR related transcription factors in response to tunicamycin (Sun et al. 2013b). A third transcription factor, the membrane bound ANAC089, has been implicated in promoting programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. Inducible overexpression of truncated ANAC089 ignited mammalian apoptotic-like symptoms in roots (Yang et al. 2014a). RNAi lines targeting ANAC089 also displayed resistance to tunicamycin induced ER stress (Yang et al. 2014a). These results support earlier findings implicating ANAC089 in the control of ER-related homeostatic mechanisms. Smyczynsk et al. (2006) in their study of a conserved immunophilin peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase PASTICCINO1 (PAS1) demonstrated through a series of biochemical experiments that PAS1 and ANAC089 (which they termed FAN, for FKBP associated NAC) interact in vivo and in vitro (Smyczynski et al. 2006). PAS1 is important in maintaining proper morphology during embryo development in Arabidopsis (Vittorioso et al. 1998). Expressed in response to cytokinin, ER-localized PAS1 associates with the VLCFA (very long chain fatty acid) synthesis complex and promotes sphingolipid biosynthesis and subsequently organ polarity through the lipids effect on the localization of the PIN1 efflux carrier (Roudier et al. 2010). A C-terminal domain of PAS1 is required for interaction and co-localization with ANAC089 (Smyczynski et al. 2006). That same domain is also required for nuclear exclusion of the PAS1. Interestingly, both PAS1 and ANAC089 are highly expressed in the mature embryo and were found to relocate from ER to the nucleus dependent upon exogenous 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatment during cellular dedifferentiation in Arabidopsis root tips (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When overexpressed in the pas1 loss of function allele, the full-length ANAC089 resulted in partial complementation of the deformed growth phenotype (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When this is taken into account in the context of the RNAi knockdowns of ANAC089 under ER stress, it may be possible that the reduction of endogenous ANAC89 may perturb cytokinin-auxin balance in a manner that promotes cell divisions in spite of continued stress signals. Taken together, these ANAC transcription factors may indeed play important roles in the secondary activation of the UPR cascade; they might also play important roles in activation of the UPR in response to other stress or hormone signaling mechanisms. For example, in a manner opposite STT3a which seems to prevent the activation of the UPR in salt stress conditions (Koiwa et al. 2003), perhaps plants treated with tunicamycin in cold conditions may require NAC062 for full UPR gene expression regulation as cold signaling mechanisms may interfere with canonical activation of IRE1 or bZIP28. Expansion of combinatorial stress experiments incorporating tunicamycin-induced stress with other environmental stressors may give a more accurate picture of regulation, and downstream targets of these transcription factors. This may consequently lead to more information regarding the in vivo function of the unmodified transcription factors in relation to the unfolded protein response. Figure 2. UPR-regulated Transcription Factors may Tailor UPR Activation to Specific Stress Combinations. Open in a new tab Several plant-specific transcription factors are upregulated under ER stress in an IRE1/bZIP28 dependent way. Two membrane-bound transcription factors, ANAC062 and ANAC089, have been shown to relocate to the nucleus under ER stress. ANAC062 also is nuclear localized under cold stress conditions. ANAC089 along with interactor PAS1 (PASTICCINO1) were also shown to relocate to the nucleus in roots treated with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid to induce dedifferentiation. ANAC103, a soluble transcription factor, was also shown to upregulate UPR genes upon over expression. Although truncated forms of these transcription factors were shown to upregulate UPR responsive genes, the molecular mechanisms of action of native transcription factors are still unknown. After upregulation by IRE1/bZIP28 dependent mechanisms, these transcription factors may respond to secondary signals which reinforce or alter UPR gene expression.Concluding Remarks: The Case for an Expanding UPR The molecular products assembled inside the ER have an ever expanding relevance to plants under environmental stress. Although many open questions still plague the study of the UPR in plants, including the identity of the molecular mechanisms for the activation and de-activation of the master regulator IRE1, the general relevance of the UPR maintaining ER homeostasis is clear. The ERQC and UPR maintain the folding capacity of the ER, and in doing so, enable a wide range of downstream processes from proper heat stress adaptation to defense against pathogens. Specifically, the downstream effectors of the UPR have been implicated in transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of both ER homeostatic genes, and developmental processes. However, new oddities arising in research focusing upstream and downstream of the UPR offer ever expanding possibilities where the UPR may play a defining role in plant physiology. UPR activation in response to plastid metabolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress implicates the potential for the UPR to respond in many different signal transduction cascades that utilize reactive oxygen species as a secondary messenger. Further inquiry exploring the canonical UPR, in non-canonical and tissue-specific contexts may help elucidate hidden functions and better integrate our understanding of UPR functionality in plant life.Significance Statement. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to the secretory pathway, the primary site of phospholipid synthesis, a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules and for the assembly a third of the proteome. The unfolded protein response (UPR) increases the protein folding capacity of the ER in response to stresses and through unknown means exerts control over plant growth and development. Here we review recent and exciting findings that explore potential molecular mechanisms that support efficient UPR in plants. We visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life.Acknowledgements We acknowledge support by the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy (award number DE-FG02-91ER20021) for infrastructure, NASA (award NNX12AN71G),  R01-GM101038, the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center [DOE Office of Science BER DE-FC02-07ER64494], AgBioResearch, and a fellowship from Michigan State University under the Training Program in Plant Biotechnology for Health and Sustainability (T32-GM110523).References Aichinger E, Kornet N, Friedrich T, Laux T.

    "abstract": "Abstract In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes. Keywords: Unfolded protein response, ER stress, Arabidopsis thaliana, reactive oxygen species, RBOHD, RBOHF",
    "introduction": "Introduction Physiological and stress situations causing insufficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet cellular demands for secretory protein folding lead to a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress (Gething et al. 1992). To overcome ER stress and restore homeostasis, protective signaling cascades, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), are originated at the ER and lead to the synthesis of ER chaperones and foldases to attenuate ER stress. If this adaptive UPR fails, such in conditions of unresolved or chronic ER stress, cells commit to programmed cell death (Ron et al. 2007, Ruberti et al. 2015, Angelos et al. 2017). In all eukaryotes, the adaptive phase of the UPR is initiated with the activation of IRE1, an ER-associated membrane kinase and ribonuclease, which catalyzes the unconventional splicing of transcripts of bZIP-transcription factors: yeast Hac1, mammalian Xbp1, or plant bZIP60. This step is necessary for the production of an active transcription factor that controls the expression of UPR target genes (Deng et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011, Moreno et al. 2012). In multicellular eukaryotes, the UPR has expanded to include additional UPR effectors, such as membrane tethered bZIP transcription factors (MTTFs), namely mammalian ATF6 and plant bZIP28. Upon sensing ER stress, these MTTFs translocate to the Golgi, where the cytosol-exposed transcription factor domain is proteolytically removed from the transmembrane anchor and translocated to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Liu et al. 2007b, Gao et al. 2008, Srivastava et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013). In metazoan cells, a third arm of the UPR is activated by the ER associated PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) protein, which oligomerizes and autophosphorylates in conditions of ER stress. PERK activity results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2A thereby promoting a global repression of the rate of the protein translation (Harding et al. 1999, Shen et al. 2002). The transcription factors ATF4 and Nrf2 downstream of PERK are able to escape this translational repression and upregulate an oxidative stress response through the production of antioxidant proteins (Harding et al. 2000, Cullinan et al. 2003). Indeed, mutations in PERK signaling markedly increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which negatively affect UPR efficiency and the ability of cells to survive ER stress (Marciniak et al. 2004, Back et al. 2009, Han et al. 2013, Maity et al. 2016). In yeast, which similarly to plants lack PERK, a dysregulated production of H2O2 under ER stress results in a translational attenuation of ER stress genes (Maity et al. 2016). Therefore, in metazoans and yeast, ROS cause attenuation of the cytoprotective functions of the UPR and acceleration of responses leading to cell death. In humans, this process potentiates the development of multiple diseases including diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis (Malhotra et al. 2007). In plants, a functional connection between ROS and the UPR management has not yet been clearly defined. During growth and in conditions of stress, several organelles including the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes generate ROS intracellularly (Tripathy et al. 2012). ROS are also produced in the apoplast mainly by the activity of the membrane-bound NADPH Oxidase (NOX) enzymes, known in plants as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) (Torres et al. 2002). The NOX/RBOH enzymes generate O2− through electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen (Gapper et al. 2006). O2− is highly reactive and is dismutated to H2O2 either via the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes or spontaneously (Mori et al. 2004). H2O2 is more stable than O2− and moves through membranes via aquaporins (Bienert et al. 2007), and it is therefore considered as a potent signaling ROS in plants (Sadhukhan et al. 2017). Thus far in plants, an increase of soluble H2O2 and lipid peroxidation during ER stress have been reported (Ozgur et al. 2014, Ozgur et al. 2015, Ozgur et al. 2018) but the source of ROS during ER stress and the influence of ER-stress generated ROS on UPR signaling are not yet established. The oxidative function of ERO1 in the ER lumen is a significant source of ER peroxides both in homeostatic conditions of growth and during ER stress; however, an increase in NADPH Oxidase activity has also been observed via biochemical assays during the early UPR (Tu et al. 2004, Sevier et al. 2008, Zito 2015, Ozgur et al. 2018). Under similar conditions, small inductions in transcript levels of RBOHD and RBOHF, two plasma membrane-localized NADPH Oxidases (Torres et al. 2002, Torres et al. 2005), were also noted in tissues subjected to ER stress treatment, leading to the suggestion that increases in ROS levels were due to the respiratory burst oxidase homologs D and F (RBOHD and RBOHF) (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, it is yet to be experimentally tested to what extent RBOH activity contributes to the ROS levels during ER stress, and whether these enzymes are necessary for the actuation of effective ER stress responses. More generally, the downstream effects of increased ROS levels during plant ER stress responses are also largely unmapped. Previous reports have shown a variable regulation of the antioxidant defense systems under conditions of ER stress. For example, in conditions of ER stress the O2− scavenging activity of superoxide dismutase is induced in roots, but down-regulated in shoots. Conversely, H2O2 scavenging activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase are upregulated in shoots but have no change in roots (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, in both roots and shoots a significantly increased glutathione content and glutathione reductase activity during ER stress lends weight to the conclusion that antioxidant defenses are upregulated to manage the increased ROS production in ER stress (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, critical questions remain unanswered. For example, it is yet unknown what effects an increase in ROS levels may have on the adaptive UPR, nor is it understood whether ROS may contribute to life or death decisions in temporary and chronic ER stress. To address these fundamental questions, in this work we explored the functional connection between ROS and the UPR in plants. We demonstrate that O2− and H2O2 are significantly contributed by RBOHD and RBOHF during ER stress. We also show that RBOHD and RBOHF elicit a transcriptional response to ROS during ER stress in the adaptive UPR. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a stringent requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF to prevent the progression of cell death in recovery from temporary ER stress and under chronic ER stress. Together, these findings support a positive role of superoxide signaling in potentiating the cell’s ability to survive temporary and chronic ER stress and ascribe a significant role to two RBOH proteins in this process.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0), rbohd rbohf, (Torres et al. 2002) ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 (Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013) plants were used in this study. For all experiments, surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (½ LS) medium, 1.0% w/v sucrose, and 1.0% agar and then cold treated (4°C) in the dark for two days to synchronize germination. Plates were then transferred to a Percival growth chamber and incubated for the indicated time at 21°C under continuous light (130 μE). Superoxide Histochemical Staining and Quantification WT or rbohd rbohf seedlings were grown vertically on for 7 days, and then transferred to ½ LS media containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm, 1.0 μg/ml TM + 2.5 μM DPI, or DMSO and allowed to grow for a further 24 or 48 hours in the growth chamber. Whole seedlings were used for the subsequent Nitro Tetrazolium Blue (NBT) staining which took place at the same time on each day. NBT was dissolved to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 6.1, and protected from light until used. To reduce the inherent variability created by staggered staining of the seedlings for very short incubation periods, all experimental groups were treated with NBT solution at the same time. To do so, six 60mm Petri dishes containing 2 ml of ddH2O were prepared. Fifteen individuals from each genotype/treatment were then transferred to separate dishes with forceps. Once all seedlings were transferred, 15 ml of NBT solution was added to each dish and covered for 15 minutes. For each plate, the NBT solution was quickly removed with a seriological pipette and replaced with ~20 ml of ddH2O to remove excess NBT. Restarting at the first dish, the ddH2O was then removed, and seedlings were submerged in 95–100% ethanol for 10 minutes to fix the root tissues. Seedlings were then mounted on slides in a 1:1 ethanol:glycerol solution with a coverslip covering just the roots. Images were obtained using the microscope function of an Olympus Tough F2.0 camera outfitted with ring LED light guide. Over a white surface, slides were placed on a 60mm Petri dish marked with a reference distance. The slide and 60mm dish were then placed in the center of a 100mm square Petri dish and covered with the lid. The camera was placed directly on the square lid for imaging to ensure consistent distance from the subject. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. To quantify the stain intensity along the root, unedited images were converted to 32 bit black and white in ImageJ. Beginning at the root apex, pixel intensities were recorded along a traced line segment (1000 individual measurements). The same line traces were then moved immediately left or right of the root and background pixel intensities were recorded. For each root, relative pixel stain intensity was calculated by subtracting the background value from the original trace value. For each experimental group the relative stain intensity from 8 roots was averaged and standard error calculated. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. Extraction and Quantification of H2O2 in Seedling Tissues using Amplex Ultra Red (Chakraborty et al. 2016)Two H2O2 extraction methods described previously (Chakraborty et al. 2016, Le et al. 2016) were tested: 1) phosphate buffer (K2HPO4, 20mM pH 6.5) and 2) neutralized Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA). For phosphate buffer extractions, 200 microliters was added to frozen tissue then briefly vortexed. Samples were then centrifuged at 21000 xg and 4°C for 20 minutes to ensure plant debris was pelleted then used immediately for H2O2 quantification. NTCA extractions were performed as follows: ten percent trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and 1M sodium bicarbonate solutions were prepared and kept on ice. Two hundred microliters of 10%TCA was added to still frozen samples on ice and briefly vortexed until mixture was homogenous and centrifuged at 21000 xg and 4°C for 20 minutes. In separate microcentrifuge tubes 86.6 microliters of sodium bicarbonate solution was aliquoted and 150 microliters of the centrifuged 10%TCA supernatant extract was added to bicarbonate containing tubes on ice. Any pink coloration due anthocyanin content in extracts should change to a dark blue hue after neutralization. One hundred microliters of the neutralized supernatants were arranged in 96 well plates on ice, to allow for sample transfer to assay with a multichannel pipette. A working solution of catalase was prepared by centrifuging ten microliters of ammonium sulfate catalase suspension (Sigma, C3515–10MG). The clear ammonium sulfate supernatant was then removed before catalase pellet was dissolved in 600 microliters of ddH2O. Five microliters of catalase working solution was then added to the remaining neutralized sample extracts in microcentrifuge tubes. These samples were incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes. One hundred microliters of the catalase treated supernatants were then stored in the same 96 well plate on ice. An H2O2 standard curve was prepared by serial dilution of 30% H2O2 to concentrations of 100 μM, 50 μM 25 μM 10 μM and 5 μM which were then diluted 10x (from 50 microliter aliquots) by sequential addition of 200 microliters of 10% TCA, 122 microliters of 1M sodium bicarbonate and 128 microliters of ddH2O to mimic extraction procedure. Final concentrations of H2O2 standards therefore ranged from 10 μM to 0.5 μM. NTCA extraction resulted in no net loss of H2O2. H2O2 standards were prepared fresh daily. Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) working solution was prepared by dissolving 1 vial of AUR in 340 microliters of DMSO per manufacturer’s instructions to make a 10mM AUR stock. AUR assay solutions were prepared immediately before use. Fifty microliters of AUR stock was added to 10 ml of ddH2O containing 5 μg/ml commercial horseradish peroxidase (AUR-HRP) and to another 10 ml of ddH2O without HRP (AUR-NoHRP). Solutions were kept on ice and protected from light. All assays were performed in clear 96 well microplates and prepared on a cold block. Twenty five microliters of neutralized samples and catalase treated samples were always pipetted prior to addition of 75 microliters of the appropriate AUR assay solution by multichannel pipette. The plate was then briefly incubated (5 min) at room temperature in the dark. Longer incubation periods did not lead to greater differences between catalase treated samples and untreated samples, only increases in AUR chemical auto-oxidation. The microplates were read using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices) equipped with fluorescence detection capabilities. The excitation wavelength was set to 544 nm, and emission was recorded at 590 nm. Experiments were performed to test the effectiveness of extraction procedures, dose response, and catalase treatment (Figure 2A,B,C). WT seedlings (~2g) were ground in a mortar with liquid nitrogen, to a fine powder and separated into triplicate 40, 30, 20, or 10 mg aliquots. Extraction procedures were performed as described above and assayed with AUR-HRP or AUR-NoHRP as indicated. To assay H2O2 accumulation under ER stress conditions WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 were grown for 7 days and transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on consecutive days. Three biological replicates consisting of approximately 30–60 mg of seedling tissue each were briefly dried on a Kimwipe and exact fresh weight recorded before samples were placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were extracted with NTCA, and then treated with catalase as indicated. For each biological replicate the neutralized samples and catalase samples were assayed in two technical replicates in the same plate with a standard curve. Each genotype was assayed in a separate plate. The catalase labile signal was calculated by subtracting average fluorescence intensity of catalase treated replicates from the average fluorescence intensity of the neutralized sample replicates. The samples were compared to the individual H2O2 standard curves to derive an [H2O2] of the samples, and total micromoles of H2O2 in the extract. This was normalized to recorded sample fresh weights. RNA extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR Analyses The RNA measurement experiments were performed in parallel with the H2O2 quantification experiments. Seedlings germinated under normal growth conditions and grown for 7 days were transferred to plates containing ½ LS media with 1.0% sucrose and 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on two consecutive days. Groups of 5–10 seedlings were pooled placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using a NucleoSpin Plant RNA kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on column DNase Digestion. All samples within the experiment were reverse-transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcriptase. RT-PCR with SYBR Green detection using a ΔΔct method was performed in technical triplicates using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time 7500 PCR system, and data normalized to the expression of UBQ10 (AT4G05320). The values presented are the mean of three independent biological replicates ±SE. Recovery from ER stress, and Chronic ER stress Phenotypic Analyses For the recovery from ER stress experiments WT, rbohd rbohf, and ire1a ire1b were germinated on ½ LS plates grown vertically for 5 days, transferred to liquid ½ LS media containing 1.0 μg ml−1 Tm for 6 hours, then replated on ½ LS plates and grown vertically for a further 3 days. The plates were then photographed and the root lengths of at least 30 individuals from 4 separate plates were determined using ImageJ; the mean ±SE was then calculated. In groups of two shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the chronic ER stress experiments WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 were germinated on ½ LS plates containing DMSO, 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, or 25 ng/ml Tm and grown for two weeks then photographed. In groups of five, shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. For both ER stress recovery and chronic stress experiments, total chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a+ chlorophyll b) per mg fresh weight was determined as described previously (Tait et al. 2003). Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen. From the liquid nitrogen 1 ml of DMSO was added to the sample tubes, inverted until mixed then incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark. Samples were then centrifuged at 21000xg and 200ul aliquots added to a clear 96 well plate for spectrophotometric quantification of chlorophyll content using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices). For all experiments at least 10 biological replicates for each experimental group were recorded, presented data represents the mean ±SE. Electrolyte Leakage Measurements WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings were grown for 7 days then transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm, or DMSO. Seedlings were imaged after six days on treatment plates. After 48 and 144 hours the extent of cell death was determined by quantification of percent electrolyte leakage as described previously with minor modifications (Dong et al. 2006, Lee et al. 2010). Groups of five seedlings were briefly washed in ddH2O, and then incubated in 4 ml of ddH2O for 3 hours in glass culture tubes with gentle agitation. Liquid conductivity was measured (Measurement 1). The tubes were autoclaved with caps and allowed to cool under gentle agitation for 3 hours. Total conductivity was measured (measurement 2) and percentage of the total was calculated as (%=measurement1/measurement2*100).",
    "results": "Results ER stress induces accumulation of superoxide by NADPH Oxidases We first aimed to test whether ER stress activates NADPH Oxidases by establishing the levels of O2−, the product of NADPH Oxidases, in seedlings subjected to induced ER stress conditions. To do so, we followed O2− accumulation in situ using nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT), a chromogenic substrate for oxidases commonly applied to the study of NADPH Oxidase activity in vivo (Dunand et al. 2007). We analyzed roots of wild type (WT) and a double RBOHD and RBOHF knockout seedlings (herein dubbed rbohd rbohf (Torres et al. 2002)). RBOHD and RBOHF belong to a ten-member family of proteins and are mainly expressed in the shoot and vascular tissue (Morales et al. 2016) After 7 days of growth on solid ½ LS media, the seedlings were transferred to solid ½ LS media containing the well-established ER stress inducer tunicamycin (Tm) for 24 or 48 hours to induce the adaptive UPR in a plate system (Iwata et al. 2005, Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2013).. We found that at 24 hours, the levels of NBT staining were only slightly increased, mainly at the root tip, both in Tm-treated WT and rbohd rbohf compared to the respective DMSO controls (Tm solvent) (Figure 1A; root tip indicated with Δ). However, at 48 hours of TM treatment, in WT and in the rbohd rbohf line the levels of NBT staining had dissipated at the root tip and increased along the maturation zone and mature root tissues (Figure 1A; mature zone and maturation zone indicated with † and ‡, respectively). The NBT staining was higher in the mature zone of WT roots compared to rbohd rbohf. These observations were validated by measurements of the relative levels of NBT staining along the root length using ImageJ (Figure 1B). These verified differences in NBT staining at the tissue level are consistent with the notion that RBOHD and RBOHF are expressed largely in shoot tissues and mature root tissues but not at the root tip in Arabidopsis (Morales et al. 2016). We next tested whether the observed NBT staining in rbohd rbohf could be due to other RBOH activity. Therefore, we supplemented the Tm-treated samples with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a broad spectrum flavoprotein inhibitor that is commonly applied in the study of RBOH proteins (Ogasawara et al. 2008). We found that DPI-treatment largely ablated the Tm-induced NBT-staining in WT and rbohd rbohf (Figure 1A,B). These results indicate that the remaining Tm-induced NBT staining found at the root tips may be sourced from the activity of RBOH other enzymes functioning redundantly to RBOHD and RBOHF (Huang et al. 2016). Together, these results indicate that RBOHD, RBOHF, and potentially other RBOH enzymes are involved in ER stress-induced O2− production, which at least for RBOHD and RBOHF is with the previously described expression pattern at the tissue level.

Tissue-specific differences in superoxide are shown by relative pixel intensities of NBT stain from the root tip ± SE. ER stress induces the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity and intact UPR signaling Because O2− is converted to H2O2, we next aimed to establish the levels of accumulation of H2O2 in seedlings undergoing ER stress. To do so, we first set up an assay to measure reliably H2O2 levels in untreated tissues. We utilized a sensitive enzymatic fluorimetric assay based on the stoichiometric oxidization of non-fluorescent Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) by H2O2 by exogenous horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to brightly fluorescent resorufin (Queval et al. 2008, Zhu et al. 2010, Chakraborty et al. 2016). We expected that this assay would lead to the detection of resorufin fluorescence in the presence of HRP and to reduced levels of resorufin fluorescence in the absence of this enzyme. We first conducted tissue extraction using potassium phosphate buffer (Chakraborty et al. 2016, Le et al. 2016), and found no significant differences in oxidization of non-fluorescent AUR by added HRP compared to the control (Figure 2A). These results indicate either that the assay was not sensitive enough or that the AUR oxidation was saturated in the absence of HRP. To test this, we implemented a 10% trichloroacetic acid extraction (neutralized: NTCA) to precipitate possibly interfering enzymatic reactions, and then assayed the levels of H2O2. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we found that, in the presence of HRP, the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly higher than in the absence of the enzyme compared to the control (Figure 2A). As a further control for the validity of our assay, we treated the samples with catalase, which specifically dismutates H2O2 in the extract and should therefore further lower the levels of resorufin fluorescence in HRP-treated samples. Conversely, we expected no differences in catalase treatment of samples extracted in potassium phosphate buffer compared the untreated control. In samples extracted with NTCA, we found that the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly lower in catalase-treated samples compared untreated samples (Figure 2C). As expected also, the addition of catalase did not alter the levels of fluorescence of potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples compared to untreated samples (Figure 2B). These results support that the resorufin fluorescence levels detected in the potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples are due to H2O2-independent oxidation of AUR. Importantly, these results also indicate that we have established a quantitative approach to track specifically H2O2 levels in tissues. Figure 2.

Using the same plate system detailed earlier (Figure 1), we compared the effects of Tm treatment for 6, 24, and 48 hours against seedlings growing on plates containing DMSO as control. We tested WT, rbohd rbohf, a mutant lacking the two IRE1 isoforms (ire1a ire1b; (Chen et al. 2012)) and a double mutant lacking functional bZIP60 and bZIP28 transcription factors (bzip60 bzip28; (Deng et al. 2013)). We found differences in H2O2 concentrations among the various backgrounds and their controls (Figure 2D), in support of a significant bearing of RBOHD and RBOHF activity as well as intact UPR on H2O2 production. To better illustrate such differences we estimated the fold change in concentration between Tm/DMSO (Figure 2E). Specifically, we found that in all backgrounds at 6-hours of treatment there were no differences in fold change of H2O2 concentrations (TM/DMSO; Figure 2E). At 24 hours, we established that Tm-treatment led to a small but significant increase in H2O2 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant background only. However, at 48 hours, coincident with significant increases in O2− in mature WT tissues (Figure 1B), we found a significant increase in H2O2 levels in WT that were not observed in the rbohd rbohf mutant (Figure 2E), indicating that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for the accumulation of H2O2 under ER stress conditions. Noticeably, the increase of H2O2 verified in WT but not rbohd rbohf was significantly greater in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants (Figure 2E), supporting a requirement of an intact UPR signaling for the management of H2O2 levels in conditions of ER stress. Together, these results indicate that H2O2 accumulates in response to ER stress in the adaptive phase of the UPR dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF activity and also influenced by the integrity of UPR signaling. UPR regulators influence RBOHD and RBOHF expression during adaptive UPR Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for ER stress-induced O2− and H2O2 production (Figures 1, 2), we next aimed to determine if the canonical UPR arms affected RBOHD or RBOHF expression at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we tested whether ER stress modulated RBOHF or RBOHD transcript levels as it occurs for other ER stress responsive genes, such as bZIP60, BiP3, ERdj3A and ERdj3B (Chen et al. 2012, Ruberti et al. 2018). To do so, a subset of seedlings from the H2O2 quantification experiments (Figure 2) were used to follow the changes in gene transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) during Tm treatment in the plate system (Iwata et al. 2005, Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2013). We found no changes in the RBOHF transcript levels in the WT, ire1a ire1b, or bzip60 bzip28 lines at 6 hours of treatment. However, at 24 and 48 hours of TM treatment, the bzip60 bzip28 line had slightly lower levels of the RBOHF transcripts compared to WT (Figure 3A). Conversely, in the WT and ire1a ire1b, the RBOHD transcripts were transiently induced at 24 hours and then restored to basal levels at 48 hours. We also observed that the RBOHD induction was significantly higher in ire1a ire1b compared to WT (Figure 3B). The RBOHD transcript levels in the bzip60 bzip28 line we found to be slightly repressed at 6 hours of treatment (with a TM/DMSO ratio of ~0.8; Figure 3B). Noticeably, however, at 24 hours in the bzip60 bzip28 line the RBOHD transcript levels were significantly lower compared to WT and ire1a ire1b. Together these results demonstrate that although the integrity of UPR signaling is required for maintaining homeostatic levels of RBOH expression during ER stress, the timing of the observed changes does not directly correlate with RBOHD and RBOHF dependent O2− (Figure 1) or H2O2 production (Figure 2) in WT plants. This indicates that other factors, such as post translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, or altered endomembrane trafficking of the protein product may contribute to these outcomes. Figure 3. Intact UPR signaling is required to maintain homeostasis of RBOH transcript levels and ROS signaling, while RBOH activity affects UPR homeostasis. Open in a new tab Time course gene expression analysis of WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings subjected to ER stress. qRT-PCR analyses were performed using primers specific for either RBOHF (A), RBOHD (B), ZAT12 (C), spliced bZIP60 (sbZIP60; D), BIP3 (E), or ERdj3B (E). Data represent the mean ratio ± SE (biological replicates=3); Statistical significance compared to equivalent WT value, unless a bracket is used to indicate comparison. Statistical significance determined using Student’s unpaired t-test and indicated by: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.005 ***=p<0.005, NS=not significant.To provide further evidence that the observed increases in O2− (Figure 1) are dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity during ER stress, we quantified the expression of ZAT12, an O2− responsive marker gene (Miller et al. 2009, Xu et al. 2017). Consistent with transiently increased levels of NBT staining at 24 hours in the root tip, which was largely independent of RBOHD and RBOHF activity (Figure 1A), we found a 6-fold upregulation in ZAT12 levels in the WT and rbohd rbohf lines (Figure 3C). Significantly at 48 hours, where we observed an increase in NBT staining of mature root tissues and upregulated H2O2 levels in WT but not rbohd rbohf seedlings (Figures 1, 2), we also found that rbohd rbohf seedlings had significantly lower levels of ZAT12 transcript (Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that 48 hours of ER stress induces O2− accumulation via RBOHD and RBOHF (Figure 1) to a level that elicits a transcriptional response. We next aimed to test whether UPR regulation of RBOHD and RBOHF transcripts or H2O2 levels (Figures 2, 3A, 3B) was correlated with changes in superoxide-dependent signaling. We found that at 6 hours of Tm treatment in ire1a ire1b the levels of ZAT12 were significantly higher compared to WT. At 24 hours of treatment, ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were slightly lower and higher than WT levels, respectively. Conversely, at 48 hours of treatment ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were higher and lower than WT levels, respectively (Figure 3C). Although the increased ZAT12 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant are consistent with the verified increase in transcription of RBOHD and H2O2 accumulation at 24 hours, the regulation of ZAT12 in both UPR mutant lines does not correlate with the RBOH transcription, or H2O2 accumulation at 48 hours. We therefore propose that an impaired UPR response likely has pleiotropic effects in the regulation of superoxide production, superoxide signaling, and H2O2 accumulation during adaptation to ER stress. We next tested whether impaired RBOHD and RBOHF activity affected the canonical UPR at a transcriptional level. We tested the levels of ER stress-responsive genes such as spliced bZIP60 transcripts (sbZIP60) and BIP3, whose abundance is primarily regulated by IRE1-bZIP60, as well as ERDJ3B, whose expression is primarily regulated by bZIP28 (Ruberti et al., 2018). In WT, we found that the Tm treatment led to increased levels of sbZIP60 transcripts at 6 hrs, which were attenuated at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 3D). Compared to WT, in the rbohd robhf line, we observed no significant changes in the induction of sbZIP60 levels at 6 hours but a significant ~2 fold reduction of sbZIP60 levels at 48 hours (Figure 3D). An altered UPR signaling in rbohd rbohf was reflected in our analyses of BIP3 transcript levels, which were ~2-fold higher at 6 hours of treatment and ~4 fold lower at 48 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT (Figure 3E). Conversely, ERdj3B was found to be ~1.2-fold lower at 6 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT, but was otherwise insignificantly different. Taken together, these results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to maintain UPR signaling homeostasis during ER stress. RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary for recovery from short-term and chronic ER stress We next aimed to test whether RBOHD and RBOHF could contribute to ER stress resolution in situations subsequent to the adaptive phase. In this context, progression of the plant UPR has been studied in conditions of relief from ER stress (temporary ER stress; (Ruberti et al. 2018)) and in conditions of unresolved ER stress (chronic ER stress; (Chen et al. 2013)). Therefore, we first tested the role of RBOHD and RBOHF in recovery from temporary ER stress. In this assay, 7-day old-seedlings are transferred to liquid media containing Tm for 6 hrs, and then re-plated on growth medium without Tm. After 3 further days of growth, shoot fresh weight, root length and chlorophyll content are assayed to assess the ability of the various genetic backgrounds to overcome ER stress upon relief from an ER stress inducer. For the assay, we used WT, rbohd rbohf and ire1a ire1b. Consistent with previous findings (Ruberti et al. 2018), at the completion of the recovery phase, we found that the shoots of the ire1a ire1b mutant weighed significantly less that DMSO-treated controls and lost most of their chlorophyll; the root also ceased further growth (Figure 4A–D). We also found that although the shoots of the Tm-treated rbohd rbohf plants weighed similarly to the Tm-treated WT (Figure 4B), a significant reduction of chlorophyll content was evident (Figure 4C). The roots of Tm-treated rbohd rbohf also showed an overall reduction in length compared to WT (Figure 4D). These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to successfully overcome temporary ER stress. Figure 4. RBOHD and RBOHF are required in the recovery from temporary ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analyses of the various genetic backgrounds subjected to temporary ER stress. A. WT, rbohd rbohf, and ire1a ire1b seedlings were subjected to ER stress and were imaged after a 3 day recovery. From the seedlings grown in (A) shoot fresh weight (B), average total chlorophyll (C), and root length (D), were recorded as described in the materials and methods. Data represent the mean ± SE. (at least 10 biological replicates). Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05).We then tested the requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF for overcoming chronic ER stress. To do so, we followed the customary approach to germinate seeds on growth medium containing Tm for comparison with seedlings germinated on control plates (Chen et al. 2012). As positive controls, we again used ire1a ire1b as well as bzip60 bzip28, which are hypersensitive to chronic ER stress (Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2012). After fourteen days of growth, we examined shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content (Figure 5A–C). Consistent with previous findings (Chen et al. 2012, Ruberti et al. 2018), the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants showed a strong phenotype with marked reduction in shoot fresh weight and loss of chlorophyll content. When we analyzed rbohd rbohf, we found a significant reduction in the average shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content compared to WT. These results indicate that, similar to temporary ER stress recovery, RBOHD and RBOHF are required to successfully overcome chronic ER stress. Figure 5. RBOHD and RBOHF are required for adaptation to chronic ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analysis of different seedling genetic backgrounds subjected to chronic ER stress. A. WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 were germinated on media containing the indicated concentration of Tm or DMSO grown for two weeks. Shoots fresh weight (B) and total chlorophyll content (C) were measured. Data represent the mean ± SE (at least 10 biological replicates). Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05). RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to preventing ER stress induced cell death Previous reports have detailed the protective role that RBOHD and RBOHF play in preventing the spread of cell death during plant immune system response through yet undetermined mechanisms (Torres et al. 2005). Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for successful recovery from temporary ER stress and survival from chronic ER stress, we postulated that these enzymes could be involved in mechanisms preventing cell death caused by ER stress. To test this hypothesis, we followed cell death by quantification of electrolyte leakage (Lee et al. 2010) in WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings exposed to Tm for two and six days (Figure 6A,B). We found that although the shoot and root of Tm-treated WT seedlings grew considerably less compared to DMSO control, no significant differences were detected in electrolyte leakage levels (Figure 6B). As expected, the bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants showed considerable chlorophyll loss with electrolyte leakage reaching almost 50% at 6 days of Tm treatment. We found that rbohd rbohf plants also showed a significant chlorophyll loss and electrolyte leakage by 6 days of Tm-treatment (Figure 6B) compared to WT plants. These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute in preventing cell death in ER stress conditions. Figure 6. RBOHD and RBOHF act to prevent ER stress induced cell death.

    "discussion": "Discussion In plants, the identity of several critical sensors and transducers of ER stress has been unraveled (Angelos et al. 2017), and the challenge ahead is to discover additional factors that participate in the UPR management. In this work, we have established that two NADPH Oxidases are necessary to overcome specific situations of ER stress, such as recovery from ER stress conditions and unresolved ER stress. These results enrich the general knowledge of the identity of the proteins and signaling pathways that contribute to ER stress survival in plants. The ability of mammalian cells to overcome ER stress is negatively influenced by NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS (Li et al. 2010). In plants, the relationship between ROS and the UPR was unknown. In this work, we showed that, in conditions of an intact UPR signaling, NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS exert a positive role on the ability of the plant to overcome ER stress. These findings support the conclusion that, despite the functional conservation of canonical ER stress sensors and transducers such as IRE1 and bZIP-transcription factors, plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress survival. NADPH Oxidases contribute to ROS production in conditions of ER stress Several metabolic and signaling processes affect cellular concentrations of H2O2 in plants, including biotic and abiotic stress responses (Miller et al. 2009), nutrient availability (Contento et al. 2010), circadian rhythms (Zhong et al. 1994), and gravity (Hausmann et al. 2014). In Arabidopsis there are also studies indicating that ER stress affects cellular concentrations of H2O2, through both direct measurements (Ozgur et al. 2014, Ozgur et al. 2018) and analyses of redox-related biochemical activities that are intimately linked with cellular H2O2 levels (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, prior to our work the nature of the enzymes contributing to H2O2 levels in conditions of ER stress had yet to be clearly established in plants. In this work, we have set up a sensitive assay to measure H2O2 levels (Figure 2). Using this assay, superoxide staining and a genetic background lacking RBOHD and RBOHF, we showed that ER stress causes activation of NADPH Oxidase-coupled superoxide production, leading to the accumulation of H2O2 (Figures 1, 2). We further show that a superoxide-responsive signaling pathway (Xu et al. 2017) is also activated, as demonstrated by transcriptional induction of the marker gene ZAT12 (Figure 3C). The concomitant reduction of three different ROS reporters in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT under conditions of ER stress (Figures 1, 2, 3; 48 hours) supports that the elevation of H2O2 in conditions of stress is contributed partially by RBOHD and RBOHF. Therefore, these findings identify two of the enzymes that operate in ROS management during ER stress potentially sharing redundant functions with other RBOH-enzymes. Although, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to activation of these enzymes in response to ER stress have yet to be elucidated, a regulation of RBOH enzymes by altered cytosolic calcium levels and association with G-protein signaling components may be postulated as contributing factors. In metazoans cellular calcium ion homeostasis is intimately linked with ER stress, as calcium is required for the proper functioning of ER luminal foldase activities (Krebs et al. 2015). Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) transporters leads to the induction of ER stress and the UPR (Krebs et al. 2015). Upon prolonged UPR activation, a number of factors, including ER lumen hyper-oxidation by ER oxidase 1a (ERO1a), leads to calcium release from the ER through activation of inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and apoptotic events (Sovolyova et al. 2014). Although IP3R-like ER calcium channels have yet to be identified in plants, SERCA-like transporters have been identified (Liang et al. 1997). Therefore it is possible that ER stress/UPR induction could alter ER and cytosolic calcium levels, which can promote RBOHD activation (Ogasawara et al. 2008). Furthermore, in plant responses to bacterial pathogen attack, it has also been demonstrated that a null mutation in the Arabidopsis Gβ subunit (agb1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein plasma membrane signaling complex was epistatic to the rbohd rbohf null mutation(Torres et al. 2013). The AGB1 gene acts in concert with receptor-like kinases to mediate oxidative burst response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity(Liu et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2016b). Although it is yet to be tested whether AGB1 interacts genetically with RBOHD and RBOHF in ER stress, similar to rbohd rbohf, agb1 is sensitive to chronic ER stress (Chen et al. 2012). It is therefore possible that AGB1 may contribute to RBOH signaling in conditions of ER stress. Unlike in metazoans, NADPH Oxidase-produced ROS are beneficial to overcome ER stress in plants Many aspects of the UPR regulators are conserved between plants and metazoans at a functional level even when compared to yeast wherein only IRE1 arm of the UPR is genetically encoded (Ron et al. 2007, Ruberti et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016a). However, it is increasingly obvious that the different evolutionary contexts between plants and animals have forced the development of different survival strategies in overcoming ER stress. The lack of a plant homolog of the mammalian PERK UPR pathway is evidence to that effect. NADPH Oxidases are largely conserved between mammals and plants (Suzuki et al. 2011). However, the activities of mammalian NADPH Oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4), two homologs of RBOHD and RBOHF, promote apoptosis during ER stress (Pedruzzi et al. 2004, Li et al. 2010). Specifically, an intravenous tunicamycin challenge in Nox2−/− mice resulted in a dramatic reduction of renal cell apoptosis and increased protection against renal dysfunction when compared to WT mice (Li et al. 2010). In this work, we show that rbohd rbohf plants display a significant sensitivity to ER stress conditions (Figures 4, 5, 6). Specifically, in the recovery from acute Tm treatment, in rbohd rbohf, the resumption of plant growth is markedly delayed, and under chronic stress conditions (Figures 5, 6), rbohd rbohf plants exhibit enhanced progression of cell death (Figure 6). Therefore, differently from the mammalian system, during ER stress NADPH Oxidases RBOHD and RBOHF exert a pro-survival role in the ER stress response. As such, the results presented in this study identify RBOHD and RBOHF as important positive contributors to UPR adaptation in plants in a manner that runs differently from the mammalian cell system. Homeostasis of NADPH Oxidase activity is required to maintain an effective UPR Several studies, including studies of RBOH activity during heat stress response in plants, support a non-specific “transcriptional priming” by which fast acting ROS production by RBOHD amplifies initial stress-specific transcriptional responses in local and systemic tissues (Mittler et al. 2015). In our analyses, we established that the RBOHD and RBOHF are involved in the adaptive phase of the UPR (Figure 3D–F) as well as in recovery from temporary ER stress and in situations of chronic ER stress (Figures 4, 5). Consistent with a priming role of RBOH activity in stress responses, the verified misregulation of the adaptive phase of the UPR due to a compromised RBOH activity may lead to a defective actuation of proper cytoprotective responses necessary for surviving temporary and chronic ER stress. Interestingly, when compared to ERdj3B levels, we verified a stronger impact on the induction levels of sbZIP60 and BIP3 in rbohd rbohf compared to WT (Figure 3D–E). Based on the findings that BIP3 expression is principally controlled by the IRE1-bZIP60 arm and that the ERdj3B is principally controlled by bZIP28 arm, we propose that the activity of RBOHD and RBOHF positively influences the transcriptional role of bZIP60. This hypothesis does not exclude that other RBOH enzymes may affect the transcriptional role of bZIP60 as well as bZIP28. Indeed, in our work, while we demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for successfully overcoming these specific conditions of ER stress, the activity of these enzymes is not strictly essential. This is supported by the relative survival of rbohd rbohf compared to ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions (Figures 4, 5, 6). Given the relatively large size of RBOH family and the residual NADPH Oxidase marker activity observed in the rbohd rbohf line (Figure 1), it is possible that RBOHD and RBOHF share redundant activity with other RBOH enzymes in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions. In ER stress conditions, the production of ROS is antagonized by IRE1 and the bZIP60/bZIP28 transcription factors The plant IRE1 as well as the availability of bZIP28 and bZIP60 together are strictly necessary to overcome temporary and prolonged stress, as demonstrated by the evidence that death is accelerated in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants compared to WT in situations of recovery from temporary ER stress or in conditions of chronic ER stress ((Nagashima et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2016a); Figures 4, 5). An analysis of ER stress response in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reported a significant transcriptional induction of ROS-dependent marker genes in IRE1 knockouts (Yamaoka et al. 2018). These findings led to the hypothesis that an increase in ROS may contribute to the ER stress sensitivity of ire1 knockout lines in this model systems (Yamaoka et al. 2018). Our results that in the Arabidopsis ire1a ire1b line, which is hypersensitive to ER stress ((Chen et al. 2012); Figures 4–6), the H2O2 levels are higher at 24 and 48 hours of Tm treatment compared to WT (Figure 2E) corroborate this hypothesis. Our results also provide direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that UPR regulators are required to manage cellular H2O2 concentrations under ER stress conditions in plants like they do in metazoans (Hourihan et al. 2016). However, the verified increases in H2O2 content in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants were not directly correlated with the observed misregulation of ZAT12/RBOHD transcript levels in these lines compared to WT, which may indicate that an intact UPR signaling potentially coordinates ROS production/signaling through multiple mechanisms to promote proper ER stress management. Conversely, the verified differences in transcript induction of UPR marker genes (i.e., sbZIP60, BIP3 and ERdj3B) in rbohd rbohf compared to WT (Figure 3D–E) indicate that RBOH activity is required to maintain proper UPR signaling. How the observed increase in H2O2 levels may affect the UPR is yet undetermined at a mechanistic level. Recent findings have shown that ER stress alters the cytosolic redox potential, which in turn modulates the activity of the transcriptional coregulatory NPR1 (nonexpresser of PR genes), which binds and represses the transcriptional function of bZIP28 and bZIP60 (Lai et al. 2018). It is similarly possible that an excessive elevation of H2O2 in conditions of ER stress changes the activity of UPR and programmed cell death modulators. The ROS species produced by RBOHD and RBOHF suppress the spread of runaway cell death in a pathway parallel to the Lesion Stimulating Disease 1 (LSD1) zinc-finger protein under normal growth conditions, in response to salicylic acid, extracellular superoxide, and pathogen induced hypersensitive response (Torres et al. 2005). The results of our study indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF may also prevent the propagation of cell death in response to chronic ER stress (Figure 6). Under this light, the noted misregulation of RBOH activity and accumulation of H2O2 in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants during ER stress (Figures 2E, 3C) may represent convergent signals that initiate processes leading toward programmed cell death, and could at least partially explain the hypersensitivity of these lines to ER stress conditions (Figure 4–6) (Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013). Therefore, together our results support the hypothesis for a dual role of H2O2 in ER stress-induced programmed cell death, which is differently manifested in WT and mutants of the UPR signaling pathway. Specifically, in cells with an intact UPR, RBOH activity and H2O2 levels are maintained to levels that promote survival; however, a defective UPR likely causes misregulation of RBOH activity and excess H2O2 accumulation that may lead to cell death. The latter scenario may be beneficial for plants to favor the survival only of cells with an intact ability to overcome proteotoxic stress.",

Copyright notice ID: 6289879 MSID: MS989173 PMID: 30218537 The publisher's version of this article is available at Plant J Abstract In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes. Keywords: Unfolded protein response, ER stress, Arabidopsis thaliana, reactive oxygen species, RBOHD, RBOHFSignificance Statement: Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be produced during endoplasmic reticulum stress, the source of ROS and their potential effects on the canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the respiratory burst oxidase homologs RBOHD and RBOHF positively contribute to plant survival under these conditions.Introduction Physiological and stress situations causing insufficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet cellular demands for secretory protein folding lead to a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress (Gething et al. 1992). To overcome ER stress and restore homeostasis, protective signaling cascades, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), are originated at the ER and lead to the synthesis of ER chaperones and foldases to attenuate ER stress. If this adaptive UPR fails, such in conditions of unresolved or chronic ER stress, cells commit to programmed cell death (Ron et al. 2007, Ruberti et al. 2015, Angelos et al. 2017). In all eukaryotes, the adaptive phase of the UPR is initiated with the activation of IRE1, an ER-associated membrane kinase and ribonuclease, which catalyzes the unconventional splicing of transcripts of bZIP-transcription factors: yeast Hac1, mammalian Xbp1, or plant bZIP60. This step is necessary for the production of an active transcription factor that controls the expression of UPR target genes (Deng et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011, Moreno et al. 2012). In multicellular eukaryotes, the UPR has expanded to include additional UPR effectors, such as membrane tethered bZIP transcription factors (MTTFs), namely mammalian ATF6 and plant bZIP28. Upon sensing ER stress, these MTTFs translocate to the Golgi, where the cytosol-exposed transcription factor domain is proteolytically removed from the transmembrane anchor and translocated to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Liu et al. 2007b, Gao et al. 2008, Srivastava et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013). In metazoan cells, a third arm of the UPR is activated by the ER associated PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) protein, which oligomerizes and autophosphorylates in conditions of ER stress. PERK activity results in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF2A thereby promoting a global repression of the rate of the protein translation (Harding et al. 1999, Shen et al. 2002). The transcription factors ATF4 and Nrf2 downstream of PERK are able to escape this translational repression and upregulate an oxidative stress response through the production of antioxidant proteins (Harding et al. 2000, Cullinan et al. 2003). Indeed, mutations in PERK signaling markedly increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which negatively affect UPR efficiency and the ability of cells to survive ER stress (Marciniak et al. 2004, Back et al. 2009, Han et al. 2013, Maity et al. 2016). In yeast, which similarly to plants lack PERK, a dysregulated production of H2O2 under ER stress results in a translational attenuation of ER stress genes (Maity et al. 2016). Therefore, in metazoans and yeast, ROS cause attenuation of the cytoprotective functions of the UPR and acceleration of responses leading to cell death. In humans, this process potentiates the development of multiple diseases including diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis (Malhotra et al. 2007). In plants, a functional connection between ROS and the UPR management has not yet been clearly defined. During growth and in conditions of stress, several organelles including the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes generate ROS intracellularly (Tripathy et al. 2012). ROS are also produced in the apoplast mainly by the activity of the membrane-bound NADPH Oxidase (NOX) enzymes, known in plants as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) (Torres et al. 2002). The NOX/RBOH enzymes generate O2− through electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen (Gapper et al. 2006). O2− is highly reactive and is dismutated to H2O2 either via the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes or spontaneously (Mori et al. 2004). H2O2 is more stable than O2− and moves through membranes via aquaporins (Bienert et al. 2007), and it is therefore considered as a potent signaling ROS in plants (Sadhukhan et al. 2017). Thus far in plants, an increase of soluble H2O2 and lipid peroxidation during ER stress have been reported (Ozgur et al. 2014, Ozgur et al. 2015, Ozgur et al. 2018) but the source of ROS during ER stress and the influence of ER-stress generated ROS on UPR signaling are not yet established. The oxidative function of ERO1 in the ER lumen is a significant source of ER peroxides both in homeostatic conditions of growth and during ER stress; however, an increase in NADPH Oxidase activity has also been observed via biochemical assays during the early UPR (Tu et al. 2004, Sevier et al. 2008, Zito 2015, Ozgur et al. 2018). Under similar conditions, small inductions in transcript levels of RBOHD and RBOHF, two plasma membrane-localized NADPH Oxidases (Torres et al. 2002, Torres et al. 2005), were also noted in tissues subjected to ER stress treatment, leading to the suggestion that increases in ROS levels were due to the respiratory burst oxidase homologs D and F (RBOHD and RBOHF) (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, it is yet to be experimentally tested to what extent RBOH activity contributes to the ROS levels during ER stress, and whether these enzymes are necessary for the actuation of effective ER stress responses. More generally, the downstream effects of increased ROS levels during plant ER stress responses are also largely unmapped. Previous reports have shown a variable regulation of the antioxidant defense systems under conditions of ER stress. For example, in conditions of ER stress the O2− scavenging activity of superoxide dismutase is induced in roots, but down-regulated in shoots. Conversely, H2O2 scavenging activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase are upregulated in shoots but have no change in roots (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, in both roots and shoots a significantly increased glutathione content and glutathione reductase activity during ER stress lends weight to the conclusion that antioxidant defenses are upregulated to manage the increased ROS production in ER stress (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, critical questions remain unanswered. For example, it is yet unknown what effects an increase in ROS levels may have on the adaptive UPR, nor is it understood whether ROS may contribute to life or death decisions in temporary and chronic ER stress. To address these fundamental questions, in this work we explored the functional connection between ROS and the UPR in plants. We demonstrate that O2− and H2O2 are significantly contributed by RBOHD and RBOHF during ER stress. We also show that RBOHD and RBOHF elicit a transcriptional response to ROS during ER stress in the adaptive UPR. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a stringent requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF to prevent the progression of cell death in recovery from temporary ER stress and under chronic ER stress. Together, these findings support a positive role of superoxide signaling in potentiating the cell’s ability to survive temporary and chronic ER stress and ascribe a significant role to two RBOH proteins in this process.Results ER stress induces accumulation of superoxide by NADPH Oxidases We first aimed to test whether ER stress activates NADPH Oxidases by establishing the levels of O2−, the product of NADPH Oxidases, in seedlings subjected to induced ER stress conditions. To do so, we followed O2− accumulation in situ using nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT), a chromogenic substrate for oxidases commonly applied to the study of NADPH Oxidase activity in vivo (Dunand et al. 2007). We analyzed roots of wild type (WT) and a double RBOHD and RBOHF knockout seedlings (herein dubbed rbohd rbohf (Torres et al. 2002)). RBOHD and RBOHF belong to a ten-member family of proteins and are mainly expressed in the shoot and vascular tissue (Morales et al. 2016) After 7 days of growth on solid ½ LS media, the seedlings were transferred to solid ½ LS media containing the well-established ER stress inducer tunicamycin (Tm) for 24 or 48 hours to induce the adaptive UPR in a plate system (Iwata et al. 2005, Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2013).. We found that at 24 hours, the levels of NBT staining were only slightly increased, mainly at the root tip, both in Tm-treated WT and rbohd rbohf compared to the respective DMSO controls (Tm solvent) (Figure 1A; root tip indicated with Δ). However, at 48 hours of TM treatment, in WT and in the rbohd rbohf line the levels of NBT staining had dissipated at the root tip and increased along the maturation zone and mature root tissues (Figure 1A; mature zone and maturation zone indicated with † and ‡, respectively). The NBT staining was higher in the mature zone of WT roots compared to rbohd rbohf. These observations were validated by measurements of the relative levels of NBT staining along the root length using ImageJ (Figure 1B). These verified differences in NBT staining at the tissue level are consistent with the notion that RBOHD and RBOHF are expressed largely in shoot tissues and mature root tissues but not at the root tip in Arabidopsis (Morales et al. 2016). We next tested whether the observed NBT staining in rbohd rbohf could be due to other RBOH activity. Therefore, we supplemented the Tm-treated samples with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a broad spectrum flavoprotein inhibitor that is commonly applied in the study of RBOH proteins (Ogasawara et al. 2008). We found that DPI-treatment largely ablated the Tm-induced NBT-staining in WT and rbohd rbohf (Figure 1A,B). These results indicate that the remaining Tm-induced NBT staining found at the root tips may be sourced from the activity of RBOH other enzymes functioning redundantly to RBOHD and RBOHF (Huang et al. 2016). Together, these results indicate that RBOHD, RBOHF, and potentially other RBOH enzymes are involved in ER stress-induced O2− production, which at least for RBOHD and RBOHF is with the previously described expression pattern at the tissue level.

Tissue-specific differences in superoxide are shown by relative pixel intensities of NBT stain from the root tip ± SE.ER stress induces the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity and intact UPR signaling Because O2− is converted to H2O2, we next aimed to establish the levels of accumulation of H2O2 in seedlings undergoing ER stress. To do so, we first set up an assay to measure reliably H2O2 levels in untreated tissues. We utilized a sensitive enzymatic fluorimetric assay based on the stoichiometric oxidization of non-fluorescent Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) by H2O2 by exogenous horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to brightly fluorescent resorufin (Queval et al. 2008, Zhu et al. 2010, Chakraborty et al. 2016). We expected that this assay would lead to the detection of resorufin fluorescence in the presence of HRP and to reduced levels of resorufin fluorescence in the absence of this enzyme. We first conducted tissue extraction using potassium phosphate buffer (Chakraborty et al. 2016, Le et al. 2016), and found no significant differences in oxidization of non-fluorescent AUR by added HRP compared to the control (Figure 2A). These results indicate either that the assay was not sensitive enough or that the AUR oxidation was saturated in the absence of HRP. To test this, we implemented a 10% trichloroacetic acid extraction (neutralized: NTCA) to precipitate possibly interfering enzymatic reactions, and then assayed the levels of H2O2. Consistent with our original hypothesis, we found that, in the presence of HRP, the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly higher than in the absence of the enzyme compared to the control (Figure 2A). As a further control for the validity of our assay, we treated the samples with catalase, which specifically dismutates H2O2 in the extract and should therefore further lower the levels of resorufin fluorescence in HRP-treated samples. Conversely, we expected no differences in catalase treatment of samples extracted in potassium phosphate buffer compared the untreated control. In samples extracted with NTCA, we found that the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly lower in catalase-treated samples compared untreated samples (Figure 2C). As expected also, the addition of catalase did not alter the levels of fluorescence of potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples compared to untreated samples (Figure 2B). These results support that the resorufin fluorescence levels detected in the potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples are due to H2O2-independent oxidation of AUR. Importantly, these results also indicate that we have established a quantitative approach to track specifically H2O2 levels in tissues. Figure 2.

Statistical significance determined using Student’s unpaired t-test and indicated by: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.005 ***=p<0.0005, NS=not significant.We then used this assay to measure the levels of H2O2 in seedlings experiencing ER stress during the adaptive phase of the UPR. Using the same plate system detailed earlier (Figure 1), we compared the effects of Tm treatment for 6, 24, and 48 hours against seedlings growing on plates containing DMSO as control. We tested WT, rbohd rbohf, a mutant lacking the two IRE1 isoforms (ire1a ire1b; (Chen et al. 2012)) and a double mutant lacking functional bZIP60 and bZIP28 transcription factors (bzip60 bzip28; (Deng et al. 2013)). We found differences in H2O2 concentrations among the various backgrounds and their controls (Figure 2D), in support of a significant bearing of RBOHD and RBOHF activity as well as intact UPR on H2O2 production. To better illustrate such differences we estimated the fold change in concentration between Tm/DMSO (Figure 2E). Specifically, we found that in all backgrounds at 6-hours of treatment there were no differences in fold change of H2O2 concentrations (TM/DMSO; Figure 2E). At 24 hours, we established that Tm-treatment led to a small but significant increase in H2O2 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant background only. However, at 48 hours, coincident with significant increases in O2− in mature WT tissues (Figure 1B), we found a significant increase in H2O2 levels in WT that were not observed in the rbohd rbohf mutant (Figure 2E), indicating that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for the accumulation of H2O2 under ER stress conditions. Noticeably, the increase of H2O2 verified in WT but not rbohd rbohf was significantly greater in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants (Figure 2E), supporting a requirement of an intact UPR signaling for the management of H2O2 levels in conditions of ER stress. Together, these results indicate that H2O2 accumulates in response to ER stress in the adaptive phase of the UPR dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF activity and also influenced by the integrity of UPR signaling.UPR regulators influence RBOHD and RBOHF expression during adaptive UPR Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for ER stress-induced O2− and H2O2 production (Figures 1, 2), we next aimed to determine if the canonical UPR arms affected RBOHD or RBOHF expression at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we tested whether ER stress modulated RBOHF or RBOHD transcript levels as it occurs for other ER stress responsive genes, such as bZIP60, BiP3, ERdj3A and ERdj3B (Chen et al. 2012, Ruberti et al. 2018). To do so, a subset of seedlings from the H2O2 quantification experiments (Figure 2) were used to follow the changes in gene transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) during Tm treatment in the plate system (Iwata et al. 2005, Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2013). We found no changes in the RBOHF transcript levels in the WT, ire1a ire1b, or bzip60 bzip28 lines at 6 hours of treatment. However, at 24 and 48 hours of TM treatment, the bzip60 bzip28 line had slightly lower levels of the RBOHF transcripts compared to WT (Figure 3A). Conversely, in the WT and ire1a ire1b, the RBOHD transcripts were transiently induced at 24 hours and then restored to basal levels at 48 hours. We also observed that the RBOHD induction was significantly higher in ire1a ire1b compared to WT (Figure 3B). The RBOHD transcript levels in the bzip60 bzip28 line we found to be slightly repressed at 6 hours of treatment (with a TM/DMSO ratio of ~0.8; Figure 3B). Noticeably, however, at 24 hours in the bzip60 bzip28 line the RBOHD transcript levels were significantly lower compared to WT and ire1a ire1b. Together these results demonstrate that although the integrity of UPR signaling is required for maintaining homeostatic levels of RBOH expression during ER stress, the timing of the observed changes does not directly correlate with RBOHD and RBOHF dependent O2− (Figure 1) or H2O2 production (Figure 2) in WT plants. This indicates that other factors, such as post translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, or altered endomembrane trafficking of the protein product may contribute to these outcomes. Figure 3. Intact UPR signaling is required to maintain homeostasis of RBOH transcript levels and ROS signaling, while RBOH activity affects UPR homeostasis. Open in a new tab Time course gene expression analysis of WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings subjected to ER stress. qRT-PCR analyses were performed using primers specific for either RBOHF (A), RBOHD (B), ZAT12 (C), spliced bZIP60 (sbZIP60; D), BIP3 (E), or ERdj3B (E). Data represent the mean ratio ± SE (biological replicates=3); Statistical significance compared to equivalent WT value, unless a bracket is used to indicate comparison. Statistical significance determined using Student’s unpaired t-test and indicated by: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.005 ***=p<0.005, NS=not significant.To provide further evidence that the observed increases in O2− (Figure 1) are dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity during ER stress, we quantified the expression of ZAT12, an O2− responsive marker gene (Miller et al. 2009, Xu et al. 2017). Consistent with transiently increased levels of NBT staining at 24 hours in the root tip, which was largely independent of RBOHD and RBOHF activity (Figure 1A), we found a 6-fold upregulation in ZAT12 levels in the WT and rbohd rbohf lines (Figure 3C). Significantly at 48 hours, where we observed an increase in NBT staining of mature root tissues and upregulated H2O2 levels in WT but not rbohd rbohf seedlings (Figures 1, 2), we also found that rbohd rbohf seedlings had significantly lower levels of ZAT12 transcript (Figure 3C). These results demonstrate that 48 hours of ER stress induces O2− accumulation via RBOHD and RBOHF (Figure 1) to a level that elicits a transcriptional response. We next aimed to test whether UPR regulation of RBOHD and RBOHF transcripts or H2O2 levels (Figures 2, 3A, 3B) was correlated with changes in superoxide-dependent signaling. We found that at 6 hours of Tm treatment in ire1a ire1b the levels of ZAT12 were significantly higher compared to WT. At 24 hours of treatment, ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were slightly lower and higher than WT levels, respectively. Conversely, at 48 hours of treatment ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were higher and lower than WT levels, respectively (Figure 3C). Although the increased ZAT12 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant are consistent with the verified increase in transcription of RBOHD and H2O2 accumulation at 24 hours, the regulation of ZAT12 in both UPR mutant lines does not correlate with the RBOH transcription, or H2O2 accumulation at 48 hours. We therefore propose that an impaired UPR response likely has pleiotropic effects in the regulation of superoxide production, superoxide signaling, and H2O2 accumulation during adaptation to ER stress. We next tested whether impaired RBOHD and RBOHF activity affected the canonical UPR at a transcriptional level. We tested the levels of ER stress-responsive genes such as spliced bZIP60 transcripts (sbZIP60) and BIP3, whose abundance is primarily regulated by IRE1-bZIP60, as well as ERDJ3B, whose expression is primarily regulated by bZIP28 (Ruberti et al., 2018). In WT, we found that the Tm treatment led to increased levels of sbZIP60 transcripts at 6 hrs, which were attenuated at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 3D). Compared to WT, in the rbohd robhf line, we observed no significant changes in the induction of sbZIP60 levels at 6 hours but a significant ~2 fold reduction of sbZIP60 levels at 48 hours (Figure 3D). An altered UPR signaling in rbohd rbohf was reflected in our analyses of BIP3 transcript levels, which were ~2-fold higher at 6 hours of treatment and ~4 fold lower at 48 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT (Figure 3E). Conversely, ERdj3B was found to be ~1.2-fold lower at 6 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT, but was otherwise insignificantly different. Taken together, these results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to maintain UPR signaling homeostasis during ER stress.RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary for recovery from short-term and chronic ER stress We next aimed to test whether RBOHD and RBOHF could contribute to ER stress resolution in situations subsequent to the adaptive phase. In this context, progression of the plant UPR has been studied in conditions of relief from ER stress (temporary ER stress; (Ruberti et al. 2018)) and in conditions of unresolved ER stress (chronic ER stress; (Chen et al. 2013)). Therefore, we first tested the role of RBOHD and RBOHF in recovery from temporary ER stress. In this assay, 7-day old-seedlings are transferred to liquid media containing Tm for 6 hrs, and then re-plated on growth medium without Tm. After 3 further days of growth, shoot fresh weight, root length and chlorophyll content are assayed to assess the ability of the various genetic backgrounds to overcome ER stress upon relief from an ER stress inducer. For the assay, we used WT, rbohd rbohf and ire1a ire1b. Consistent with previous findings (Ruberti et al. 2018), at the completion of the recovery phase, we found that the shoots of the ire1a ire1b mutant weighed significantly less that DMSO-treated controls and lost most of their chlorophyll; the root also ceased further growth (Figure 4A–D). We also found that although the shoots of the Tm-treated rbohd rbohf plants weighed similarly to the Tm-treated WT (Figure 4B), a significant reduction of chlorophyll content was evident (Figure 4C). The roots of Tm-treated rbohd rbohf also showed an overall reduction in length compared to WT (Figure 4D). These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to successfully overcome temporary ER stress. Figure 4. RBOHD and RBOHF are required in the recovery from temporary ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analyses of the various genetic backgrounds subjected to temporary ER stress. A. WT, rbohd rbohf, and ire1a ire1b seedlings were subjected to ER stress and were imaged after a 3 day recovery. From the seedlings grown in (A) shoot fresh weight (B), average total chlorophyll (C), and root length (D), were recorded as described in the materials and methods. Data represent the mean ± SE. (at least 10 biological replicates). Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05).We then tested the requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF for overcoming chronic ER stress. To do so, we followed the customary approach to germinate seeds on growth medium containing Tm for comparison with seedlings germinated on control plates (Chen et al. 2012). As positive controls, we again used ire1a ire1b as well as bzip60 bzip28, which are hypersensitive to chronic ER stress (Liu et al. 2007a, Chen et al. 2012). After fourteen days of growth, we examined shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content (Figure 5A–C). Consistent with previous findings (Chen et al. 2012, Ruberti et al. 2018), the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants showed a strong phenotype with marked reduction in shoot fresh weight and loss of chlorophyll content. When we analyzed rbohd rbohf, we found a significant reduction in the average shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content compared to WT. These results indicate that, similar to temporary ER stress recovery, RBOHD and RBOHF are required to successfully overcome chronic ER stress. Figure 5. RBOHD and RBOHF are required for adaptation to chronic ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analysis of different seedling genetic backgrounds subjected to chronic ER stress. A.

Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05).RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to preventing ER stress induced cell death Previous reports have detailed the protective role that RBOHD and RBOHF play in preventing the spread of cell death during plant immune system response through yet undetermined mechanisms (Torres et al. 2005). Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for successful recovery from temporary ER stress and survival from chronic ER stress, we postulated that these enzymes could be involved in mechanisms preventing cell death caused by ER stress. To test this hypothesis, we followed cell death by quantification of electrolyte leakage (Lee et al. 2010) in WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings exposed to Tm for two and six days (Figure 6A,B). We found that although the shoot and root of Tm-treated WT seedlings grew considerably less compared to DMSO control, no significant differences were detected in electrolyte leakage levels (Figure 6B). As expected, the bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants showed considerable chlorophyll loss with electrolyte leakage reaching almost 50% at 6 days of Tm treatment. We found that rbohd rbohf plants also showed a significant chlorophyll loss and electrolyte leakage by 6 days of Tm-treatment (Figure 6B) compared to WT plants. These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute in preventing cell death in ER stress conditions. Figure 6. RBOHD and RBOHF act to prevent ER stress induced cell death.

Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05).Discussion In plants, the identity of several critical sensors and transducers of ER stress has been unraveled (Angelos et al. 2017), and the challenge ahead is to discover additional factors that participate in the UPR management. In this work, we have established that two NADPH Oxidases are necessary to overcome specific situations of ER stress, such as recovery from ER stress conditions and unresolved ER stress. These results enrich the general knowledge of the identity of the proteins and signaling pathways that contribute to ER stress survival in plants. The ability of mammalian cells to overcome ER stress is negatively influenced by NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS (Li et al. 2010). In plants, the relationship between ROS and the UPR was unknown. In this work, we showed that, in conditions of an intact UPR signaling, NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS exert a positive role on the ability of the plant to overcome ER stress. These findings support the conclusion that, despite the functional conservation of canonical ER stress sensors and transducers such as IRE1 and bZIP-transcription factors, plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress survival. NADPH Oxidases contribute to ROS production in conditions of ER stress Several metabolic and signaling processes affect cellular concentrations of H2O2 in plants, including biotic and abiotic stress responses (Miller et al. 2009), nutrient availability (Contento et al. 2010), circadian rhythms (Zhong et al. 1994), and gravity (Hausmann et al. 2014). In Arabidopsis there are also studies indicating that ER stress affects cellular concentrations of H2O2, through both direct measurements (Ozgur et al. 2014, Ozgur et al. 2018) and analyses of redox-related biochemical activities that are intimately linked with cellular H2O2 levels (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, prior to our work the nature of the enzymes contributing to H2O2 levels in conditions of ER stress had yet to be clearly established in plants. In this work, we have set up a sensitive assay to measure H2O2 levels (Figure 2). Using this assay, superoxide staining and a genetic background lacking RBOHD and RBOHF, we showed that ER stress causes activation of NADPH Oxidase-coupled superoxide production, leading to the accumulation of H2O2 (Figures 1, 2). We further show that a superoxide-responsive signaling pathway (Xu et al. 2017) is also activated, as demonstrated by transcriptional induction of the marker gene ZAT12 (Figure 3C). The concomitant reduction of three different ROS reporters in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT under conditions of ER stress (Figures 1, 2, 3; 48 hours) supports that the elevation of H2O2 in conditions of stress is contributed partially by RBOHD and RBOHF. Therefore, these findings identify two of the enzymes that operate in ROS management during ER stress potentially sharing redundant functions with other RBOH-enzymes. Although, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to activation of these enzymes in response to ER stress have yet to be elucidated, a regulation of RBOH enzymes by altered cytosolic calcium levels and association with G-protein signaling components may be postulated as contributing factors. In metazoans cellular calcium ion homeostasis is intimately linked with ER stress, as calcium is required for the proper functioning of ER luminal foldase activities (Krebs et al. 2015). Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) transporters leads to the induction of ER stress and the UPR (Krebs et al. 2015). Upon prolonged UPR activation, a number of factors, including ER lumen hyper-oxidation by ER oxidase 1a (ERO1a), leads to calcium release from the ER through activation of inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and apoptotic events (Sovolyova et al. 2014). Although IP3R-like ER calcium channels have yet to be identified in plants, SERCA-like transporters have been identified (Liang et al. 1997). Therefore it is possible that ER stress/UPR induction could alter ER and cytosolic calcium levels, which can promote RBOHD activation (Ogasawara et al. 2008). Furthermore, in plant responses to bacterial pathogen attack, it has also been demonstrated that a null mutation in the Arabidopsis Gβ subunit (agb1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein plasma membrane signaling complex was epistatic to the rbohd rbohf null mutation(Torres et al. 2013). The AGB1 gene acts in concert with receptor-like kinases to mediate oxidative burst response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity(Liu et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2016b). Although it is yet to be tested whether AGB1 interacts genetically with RBOHD and RBOHF in ER stress, similar to rbohd rbohf, agb1 is sensitive to chronic ER stress (Chen et al. 2012). It is therefore possible that AGB1 may contribute to RBOH signaling in conditions of ER stress.Unlike in metazoans, NADPH Oxidase-produced ROS are beneficial to overcome ER stress in plants Many aspects of the UPR regulators are conserved between plants and metazoans at a functional level even when compared to yeast wherein only IRE1 arm of the UPR is genetically encoded (Ron et al. 2007, Ruberti et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016a). However, it is increasingly obvious that the different evolutionary contexts between plants and animals have forced the development of different survival strategies in overcoming ER stress. The lack of a plant homolog of the mammalian PERK UPR pathway is evidence to that effect. NADPH Oxidases are largely conserved between mammals and plants (Suzuki et al. 2011). However, the activities of mammalian NADPH Oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4), two homologs of RBOHD and RBOHF, promote apoptosis during ER stress (Pedruzzi et al. 2004, Li et al. 2010). Specifically, an intravenous tunicamycin challenge in Nox2−/− mice resulted in a dramatic reduction of renal cell apoptosis and increased protection against renal dysfunction when compared to WT mice (Li et al. 2010). In this work, we show that rbohd rbohf plants display a significant sensitivity to ER stress conditions (Figures 4, 5, 6). Specifically, in the recovery from acute Tm treatment, in rbohd rbohf, the resumption of plant growth is markedly delayed, and under chronic stress conditions (Figures 5, 6), rbohd rbohf plants exhibit enhanced progression of cell death (Figure 6). Therefore, differently from the mammalian system, during ER stress NADPH Oxidases RBOHD and RBOHF exert a pro-survival role in the ER stress response. As such, the results presented in this study identify RBOHD and RBOHF as important positive contributors to UPR adaptation in plants in a manner that runs differently from the mammalian cell system.Homeostasis of NADPH Oxidase activity is required to maintain an effective UPR Several studies, including studies of RBOH activity during heat stress response in plants, support a non-specific “transcriptional priming” by which fast acting ROS production by RBOHD amplifies initial stress-specific transcriptional responses in local and systemic tissues (Mittler et al. 2015). In our analyses, we established that the RBOHD and RBOHF are involved in the adaptive phase of the UPR (Figure 3D–F) as well as in recovery from temporary ER stress and in situations of chronic ER stress (Figures 4, 5). Consistent with a priming role of RBOH activity in stress responses, the verified misregulation of the adaptive phase of the UPR due to a compromised RBOH activity may lead to a defective actuation of proper cytoprotective responses necessary for surviving temporary and chronic ER stress. Interestingly, when compared to ERdj3B levels, we verified a stronger impact on the induction levels of sbZIP60 and BIP3 in rbohd rbohf compared to WT (Figure 3D–E). Based on the findings that BIP3 expression is principally controlled by the IRE1-bZIP60 arm and that the ERdj3B is principally controlled by bZIP28 arm, we propose that the activity of RBOHD and RBOHF positively influences the transcriptional role of bZIP60. This hypothesis does not exclude that other RBOH enzymes may affect the transcriptional role of bZIP60 as well as bZIP28. Indeed, in our work, while we demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for successfully overcoming these specific conditions of ER stress, the activity of these enzymes is not strictly essential. This is supported by the relative survival of rbohd rbohf compared to ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions (Figures 4, 5, 6). Given the relatively large size of RBOH family and the residual NADPH Oxidase marker activity observed in the rbohd rbohf line (Figure 1), it is possible that RBOHD and RBOHF share redundant activity with other RBOH enzymes in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions.In ER stress conditions, the production of ROS is antagonized by IRE1 and the bZIP60/bZIP28 transcription factors The plant IRE1 as well as the availability of bZIP28 and bZIP60 together are strictly necessary to overcome temporary and prolonged stress, as demonstrated by the evidence that death is accelerated in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants compared to WT in situations of recovery from temporary ER stress or in conditions of chronic ER stress ((Nagashima et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2016a); Figures 4, 5). An analysis of ER stress response in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reported a significant transcriptional induction of ROS-dependent marker genes in IRE1 knockouts (Yamaoka et al. 2018). These findings led to the hypothesis that an increase in ROS may contribute to the ER stress sensitivity of ire1 knockout lines in this model systems (Yamaoka et al. 2018). Our results that in the Arabidopsis ire1a ire1b line, which is hypersensitive to ER stress ((Chen et al. 2012); Figures 4–6), the H2O2 levels are higher at 24 and 48 hours of Tm treatment compared to WT (Figure 2E) corroborate this hypothesis. Our results also provide direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that UPR regulators are required to manage cellular H2O2 concentrations under ER stress conditions in plants like they do in metazoans (Hourihan et al. 2016). However, the verified increases in H2O2 content in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants were not directly correlated with the observed misregulation of ZAT12/RBOHD transcript levels in these lines compared to WT, which may indicate that an intact UPR signaling potentially coordinates ROS production/signaling through multiple mechanisms to promote proper ER stress management. Conversely, the verified differences in transcript induction of UPR marker genes (i.e., sbZIP60, BIP3 and ERdj3B) in rbohd rbohf compared to WT (Figure 3D–E) indicate that RBOH activity is required to maintain proper UPR signaling. How the observed increase in H2O2 levels may affect the UPR is yet undetermined at a mechanistic level. Recent findings have shown that ER stress alters the cytosolic redox potential, which in turn modulates the activity of the transcriptional coregulatory NPR1 (nonexpresser of PR genes), which binds and represses the transcriptional function of bZIP28 and bZIP60 (Lai et al. 2018). It is similarly possible that an excessive elevation of H2O2 in conditions of ER stress changes the activity of UPR and programmed cell death modulators. The ROS species produced by RBOHD and RBOHF suppress the spread of runaway cell death in a pathway parallel to the Lesion Stimulating Disease 1 (LSD1) zinc-finger protein under normal growth conditions, in response to salicylic acid, extracellular superoxide, and pathogen induced hypersensitive response (Torres et al. 2005). The results of our study indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF may also prevent the propagation of cell death in response to chronic ER stress (Figure 6). Under this light, the noted misregulation of RBOH activity and accumulation of H2O2 in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants during ER stress (Figures 2E, 3C) may represent convergent signals that initiate processes leading toward programmed cell death, and could at least partially explain the hypersensitivity of these lines to ER stress conditions (Figure 4–6) (Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013). Therefore, together our results support the hypothesis for a dual role of H2O2 in ER stress-induced programmed cell death, which is differently manifested in WT and mutants of the UPR signaling pathway. Specifically, in cells with an intact UPR, RBOH activity and H2O2 levels are maintained to levels that promote survival; however, a defective UPR likely causes misregulation of RBOH activity and excess H2O2 accumulation that may lead to cell death. The latter scenario may be beneficial for plants to favor the survival only of cells with an intact ability to overcome proteotoxic stress.Methods Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0), rbohd rbohf, (Torres et al. 2002) ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 (Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013) plants were used in this study. For all experiments, surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (½ LS) medium, 1.0% w/v sucrose, and 1.0% agar and then cold treated (4°C) in the dark for two days to synchronize germination. Plates were then transferred to a Percival growth chamber and incubated for the indicated time at 21°C under continuous light (130 μE).Superoxide Histochemical Staining and Quantification WT or rbohd rbohf seedlings were grown vertically on for 7 days, and then transferred to ½ LS media containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm, 1.0 μg/ml TM + 2.5 μM DPI, or DMSO and allowed to grow for a further 24 or 48 hours in the growth chamber. Whole seedlings were used for the subsequent Nitro Tetrazolium Blue (NBT) staining which took place at the same time on each day. NBT was dissolved to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 6.1, and protected from light until used. To reduce the inherent variability created by staggered staining of the seedlings for very short incubation periods, all experimental groups were treated with NBT solution at the same time. To do so, six 60mm Petri dishes containing 2 ml of ddH2O were prepared. Fifteen individuals from each genotype/treatment were then transferred to separate dishes with forceps. Once all seedlings were transferred, 15 ml of NBT solution was added to each dish and covered for 15 minutes. For each plate, the NBT solution was quickly removed with a seriological pipette and replaced with ~20 ml of ddH2O to remove excess NBT. Restarting at the first dish, the ddH2O was then removed, and seedlings were submerged in 95–100% ethanol for 10 minutes to fix the root tissues. Seedlings were then mounted on slides in a 1:1 ethanol:glycerol solution with a coverslip covering just the roots. Images were obtained using the microscope function of an Olympus Tough F2.0 camera outfitted with ring LED light guide. Over a white surface, slides were placed on a 60mm Petri dish marked with a reference distance. The slide and 60mm dish were then placed in the center of a 100mm square Petri dish and covered with the lid. The camera was placed directly on the square lid for imaging to ensure consistent distance from the subject. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. To quantify the stain intensity along the root, unedited images were converted to 32 bit black and white in ImageJ. Beginning at the root apex, pixel intensities were recorded along a traced line segment (1000 individual measurements). The same line traces were then moved immediately left or right of the root and background pixel intensities were recorded. For each root, relative pixel stain intensity was calculated by subtracting the background value from the original trace value. For each experimental group the relative stain intensity from 8 roots was averaged and standard error calculated. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results.Extraction and Quantification of H2O2 in Seedling Tissues using Amplex Ultra Red (Chakraborty et al. 2016)Two H2O2 extraction methods described previously (Chakraborty et al. 2016, Le et al. 2016) were tested: 1) phosphate buffer (K2HPO4, 20mM pH 6.5) and 2) neutralized Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA). For phosphate buffer extractions, 200 microliters was added to frozen tissue then briefly vortexed. Samples were then centrifuged at 21000 xg and 4°C for 20 minutes to ensure plant debris was pelleted then used immediately for H2O2 quantification. NTCA extractions were performed as follows: ten percent trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and 1M sodium bicarbonate solutions were prepared and kept on ice. Two hundred microliters of 10%TCA was added to still frozen samples on ice and briefly vortexed until mixture was homogenous and centrifuged at 21000 xg and 4°C for 20 minutes. In separate microcentrifuge tubes 86.6 microliters of sodium bicarbonate solution was aliquoted and 150 microliters of the centrifuged 10%TCA supernatant extract was added to bicarbonate containing tubes on ice. Any pink coloration due anthocyanin content in extracts should change to a dark blue hue after neutralization. One hundred microliters of the neutralized supernatants were arranged in 96 well plates on ice, to allow for sample transfer to assay with a multichannel pipette. A working solution of catalase was prepared by centrifuging ten microliters of ammonium sulfate catalase suspension (Sigma, C3515–10MG). The clear ammonium sulfate supernatant was then removed before catalase pellet was dissolved in 600 microliters of ddH2O. Five microliters of catalase working solution was then added to the remaining neutralized sample extracts in microcentrifuge tubes. These samples were incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes. One hundred microliters of the catalase treated supernatants were then stored in the same 96 well plate on ice. An H2O2 standard curve was prepared by serial dilution of 30% H2O2 to concentrations of 100 μM, 50 μM 25 μM 10 μM and 5 μM which were then diluted 10x (from 50 microliter aliquots) by sequential addition of 200 microliters of 10% TCA, 122 microliters of 1M sodium bicarbonate and 128 microliters of ddH2O to mimic extraction procedure. Final concentrations of H2O2 standards therefore ranged from 10 μM to 0.5 μM. NTCA extraction resulted in no net loss of H2O2. H2O2 standards were prepared fresh daily. Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) working solution was prepared by dissolving 1 vial of AUR in 340 microliters of DMSO per manufacturer’s instructions to make a 10mM AUR stock. AUR assay solutions were prepared immediately before use. Fifty microliters of AUR stock was added to 10 ml of ddH2O containing 5 μg/ml commercial horseradish peroxidase (AUR-HRP) and to another 10 ml of ddH2O without HRP (AUR-NoHRP). Solutions were kept on ice and protected from light. All assays were performed in clear 96 well microplates and prepared on a cold block. Twenty five microliters of neutralized samples and catalase treated samples were always pipetted prior to addition of 75 microliters of the appropriate AUR assay solution by multichannel pipette. The plate was then briefly incubated (5 min) at room temperature in the dark. Longer incubation periods did not lead to greater differences between catalase treated samples and untreated samples, only increases in AUR chemical auto-oxidation. The microplates were read using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices) equipped with fluorescence detection capabilities. The excitation wavelength was set to 544 nm, and emission was recorded at 590 nm. Experiments were performed to test the effectiveness of extraction procedures, dose response, and catalase treatment (Figure 2A,B,C). WT seedlings (~2g) were ground in a mortar with liquid nitrogen, to a fine powder and separated into triplicate 40, 30, 20, or 10 mg aliquots. Extraction procedures were performed as described above and assayed with AUR-HRP or AUR-NoHRP as indicated. To assay H2O2 accumulation under ER stress conditions WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 were grown for 7 days and transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on consecutive days. Three biological replicates consisting of approximately 30–60 mg of seedling tissue each were briefly dried on a Kimwipe and exact fresh weight recorded before samples were placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were extracted with NTCA, and then treated with catalase as indicated. For each biological replicate the neutralized samples and catalase samples were assayed in two technical replicates in the same plate with a standard curve. Each genotype was assayed in a separate plate. The catalase labile signal was calculated by subtracting average fluorescence intensity of catalase treated replicates from the average fluorescence intensity of the neutralized sample replicates. The samples were compared to the individual H2O2 standard curves to derive an [H2O2] of the samples, and total micromoles of H2O2 in the extract. This was normalized to recorded sample fresh weights.RNA extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR Analyses The RNA measurement experiments were performed in parallel with the H2O2 quantification experiments. Seedlings germinated under normal growth conditions and grown for 7 days were transferred to plates containing ½ LS media with 1.0% sucrose and 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on two consecutive days. Groups of 5–10 seedlings were pooled placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using a NucleoSpin Plant RNA kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on column DNase Digestion. All samples within the experiment were reverse-transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcriptase. RT-PCR with SYBR Green detection using a ΔΔct method was performed in technical triplicates using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time 7500 PCR system, and data normalized to the expression of UBQ10 (AT4G05320). The values presented are the mean of three independent biological replicates ±SE.Recovery from ER stress, and Chronic ER stress Phenotypic Analyses For the recovery from ER stress experiments WT, rbohd rbohf, and ire1a ire1b were germinated on ½ LS plates grown vertically for 5 days, transferred to liquid ½ LS media containing 1.0 μg ml−1 Tm for 6 hours, then replated on ½ LS plates and grown vertically for a further 3 days. The plates were then photographed and the root lengths of at least 30 individuals from 4 separate plates were determined using ImageJ; the mean ±SE was then calculated. In groups of two shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the chronic ER stress experiments WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 were germinated on ½ LS plates containing DMSO, 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, or 25 ng/ml Tm and grown for two weeks then photographed. In groups of five, shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. For both ER stress recovery and chronic stress experiments, total chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a+ chlorophyll b) per mg fresh weight was determined as described previously (Tait et al. 2003). Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen. From the liquid nitrogen 1 ml of DMSO was added to the sample tubes, inverted until mixed then incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark. Samples were then centrifuged at 21000xg and 200ul aliquots added to a clear 96 well plate for spectrophotometric quantification of chlorophyll content using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices). For all experiments at least 10 biological replicates for each experimental group were recorded, presented data represents the mean ±SE.Electrolyte Leakage Measurements WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings were grown for 7 days then transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm, or DMSO. Seedlings were imaged after six days on treatment plates. After 48 and 144 hours the extent of cell death was determined by quantification of percent electrolyte leakage as described previously with minor modifications (Dong et al. 2006, Lee et al. 2010). Groups of five seedlings were briefly washed in ddH2O, and then incubated in 4 ml of ddH2O for 3 hours in glass culture tubes with gentle agitation. Liquid conductivity was measured (Measurement 1). The tubes were autoclaved with caps and allowed to cool under gentle agitation for 3 hours. Total conductivity was measured (measurement 2) and percentage of the total was calculated as (%=measurement1/measurement2*100).Acknowledgements We acknowledge support by the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences Division, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy (award number DE-FG02–91ER20021) for infrastructure, NASA (award NNX12AN71G),  R01-GM101038, and a fellowship from Michigan State University under the Training Program in Plant Biotechnology for Health and Sustainability (T32-GM110523).Footnotes The authors declare no conflicts of interest.Literature Cited Angelos E, Ruberti C, Kim SJ and Brandizzi F (2017).

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks. Key Words: Spaceflight, Unfolded protein response, Arabidopsis, Microgravity.",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Extraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferl et al., 2002; Massa et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paul et al., 2013). Recent iterations of the sophisticated chamber hardware for plant growth housed on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for multigenerational plant growth in space and analyses of plant responses to this environment (Massa et al., 2016). However, these facilities are insufficient for large-scale plant growth on extraterrestrial environments due to their size and resource cost. Therefore, generation of germplasm adapted to stresses experienced during growth in extraterrestrial environments is a critical contribution to the realization of sustainable plant cultivation in space. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses. The UPR is generally activated by a buildup of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition known as ER stress (Ron and Walter, 2007). The ER stress sensors conserved across metazoans and plants include the ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and ER membrane-tethered transcription factors (TFs) (metazoan activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and plant basic leucine zipper 17 [bZIP17] and bZIP28). Activation of IRE1 leads to unconventional splicing of an intron from the mRNA of an IRE1-downstream bZIP-TF (metazoan X-box binding protein 1 and plant bZIP60). The UPR TFs are translocated to the nucleus to control expression of UPR target genes and restore ER homeostasis (Koizumi et al., 2001; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Halbleib et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018; Ruberti et al., 2018; Tam et al., 2018; Mishiba et al., 2019; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Pu et al., 2019). Insufficient UPR leads to the actuation of cell death (Ron and Walter, 2007; Walter and Ron, 2011). In terrestrially grown plants, the UPR is a key mediator of responses to a variety of stresses, including heat, pathogen, and high light/singlet oxygen (Deng et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2012; Guillemette et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Beaugelin et al., 2020). Additionally, analyses of higher order UPR mutants have demonstrated that the UPR regulators are necessary for post-embryonic growth and reproductive development in Arabidopsis under unstressed conditions as well (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Kim et al., 2018; Mishiba et al., 2019; Pu et al., 2019). Therefore, a better understanding of the UPR can enable efforts to potentiate plant stress responses and improve plant yield. Given the broad responsiveness of the UPR to environmental stresses, we hypothesized that the UPR effectors could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed global gene expression changes in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis as well as loss-of-function mutants of IRE1 (ire1a ire1b, herein dubbed ire1), bZIP28, and bZIP60 (single and double mutants: bzip28, bzip60, bzip28 bzip60), cultivated in orbit during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to the ISS. We used these genetic backgrounds to identify genes controlled jointly or specifically by the UPR sensors and UPR TFs and define the extent to which the known signaling pathways of the UPR functionally interact in a whole organism under microgravity-associated conditions. We established that, in space and on ground, gene expression undergoes a substantial reprogramming on a genome-scale. Growth in orbit substantially altered the expression of thousands of genes associated with significant biological traits compared with ground controls. However, while many of these spaceflight-responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control, such a genotype-specific regulation was not observed in the spaceflight condition. These observations not only provide new insight into how plants respond to spaceflight, but also establish that spaceflight-induced transcriptional responses mitigate the need for the gene-regulatory networks controlled by the UPR sensors.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Launch hardware and experimental timeline This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period. PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with a tissue fixative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at the conclusion of the flight experiment. An identical set of samples was prepared and grown on Earth with a 2-day offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental Simulator to allow for data transmission and reproduction of incubation conditions experienced by flight samples in orbit. HOBO data loggers equipped with temperature sensors were integrated into two of the four BRICs to record temperatures experienced by samples during the experiment for post hoc analysis. Launch samples (i.e., Arabidopsis seeds) were integrated into BRIC flight hardware in a sterile hood ∼48 h before the August 14, 2017, launch of SpaceX CRS12 spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4°C to maintain seed dormancy before packing in cold storage bags while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch. After docking, samples were removed from cold storage bags by ISS astronauts, warmed to ambient ISS temperature, allowing seed germination and experiment initiation in the BRIC. After 14 days, ISS astronauts actuated PDFUs, which were then incubated at room temperature for a further 3 h before being transferred to the ISS −80 MELFI freezer. Samples were kept at approximately −80°C until BRICs were conditioned to −32°C in double cold bag storage (Hutchison and Campana, 2009) and stowed in the Dragon capsule before undocking and atmospheric reentry on September 16. After returning to KSC, samples were stored at −80°C until de-integration of the flight and ground samples. De-integration occurred on November 1, 2017. 2.2. Germplasm and culture conditions Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the following genotypes were used for flight and ground controls: WT (Col-0 ecotype), atire1 (Nagashima et al., 2011; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012), bzip60 (Moreno et al., 2012), bzip28 (Gao et al., 2008), and bzip28 bzip60 (Deng et al., 2013). Petri dishes (60 mm) were prepared with 6.7 mL of sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with Gamborg's B5 Vitamins (PhytoTechnology Laboratories), 0.5% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.7. In a sterile hood, seeds of WT and UPR-mutant genotypes were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then nine additional washes with sterile H2O distilled twice. After the final wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in 1.5 mL sterile water for wet plating by using a 1 mL pipette equipped with sterile filter tip. For each experimental unit (flight and ground control), five plate replicates of WT and bzip28/bzip60 genotypes and four plate replicates of atire1, bzip28, and bzip60 genotypes were prepared. Each plate replicate contained 70–80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid pattern on the plate surface. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm (Heathrow Scientific), and individual plates were then wrapped twice with sterile aluminum foil. Individually wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC configuration and wrapped together with two more layers of sterile aluminum foil before sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were placed at 4°C until the integration of samples into science hardware the following morning. 2.3. Sample processing and experimental material assessment Samples of flight and ground control experiments were preserved in RNAlater in situ and kept at −80°C (see the Results section for experimental timeline). The Petri dishes were removed from packaging and thawed in groups of three to prevent excess exposure to room temperature during sample collection. After removing most of the RNAlater from the plates, sterile forceps were used to transfer seedlings from the plates to microcentrifuge tubes containing two glass beads. Seedlings were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. This procedure was carried out quickly to maximize RNA recovery. Accordingly, only some pictures were taken of plates before extraction for example purposes. Most pictures were taken after the bulk of the sample was removed, with the remaining seedlings also imaged for post hoc inspection. All plates were free from any visible evidence of bacterial or fungal contamination. Frozen samples were ground to a powder with a Retsch Mixer Mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany). RNA was extracted from tissues by using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions including DNase digestion. The overall quality and RNA integrity number (RIN) of RNA samples were assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). 2.4. Library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed by using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced in single-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (50-nt) at Research Technology Support Facility Genomics Core at Michigan State University. For each library, read quality was assessed with the FastQC (version 0.11.3) software (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Reads were cleaned for quality and adapter sequences with Cutadapt (version1.8.1) using a minimum base quality 20 retaining reads with a minimum length of 30 nucleotides after trimming (Martin, 2011). Quality-filtered reads were aligned to the Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10) with Bowtie (version 2.3.1) and TopHat (version 2.1.1) with a 10 bp minimum intron length and 15,000 bp maximum intron length (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Fragments per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) were measured by using TAIR10 gene model annotation with Cufflinks (version 1.3.0) (Trapnell et al., 2010). The log2 transformed and normalized gene expression levels (FPKM +1) were used for correlation analysis (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) between biological replicates and principal component analysis (PCA). Per-gene read counts were identified with HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) in the union mode with a minimum mapping quality of 20 with stranded reverse counting (Anders et al., 2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed in four biological replicates (for WT and bzip28 bzip60, selected based on the correlation with other biological replicates) with DESeq2 (version 1.16.1) within R (version 3.4.0) based on a comparison of spaceflight to ground with adjusted p-value <0.01 and absolute log2-transformed fold change >1.5 (Love et al., 2014). Genes of which the total count across all samples is <100 were not included in the analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) overrepresentation was performed with PANTHER (Fisher's exact type with false discovery rate correction) (www.pantherdb.org) (Mi et al., 2019a, 2019b). K-means clustering analysis on average FPKM values from biological replicates was performed using the Morpheus tool (Morpheus, https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The optimal number of K-means clusters was determined with the factoextra package in R.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Spaceflight alters the growth of seedlings independent of an intact UPR signaling When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings (atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60) of the ground control and flight samples at the completion of the mission, we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hypocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light) were above the surface of the solidified media while roots had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1A). However, in flight samples, we found that etiolated hypocotyls as well as roots had generally penetrated the growth medium regardless of genotype tested (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we also observed that cotyledon petioles of flight sample seedlings were elongated (Fig. 1B) compared with ground control seedlings (Fig. 1A). Overall, these observations are consistent with plant growth in the darkness and space, conditions leading to elongated hypocotyls and petioles, and a lack of directional growth, respectively (Paul et al., 2017). These observations also suggest that the UPR unlikely exerts a noticeable role in growth direction in response to altered gravity levels. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab (A) Representative ground and flight sample plates were imaged after the bulk of etiolated hypocotyls, and RNAlater was removed to ensure maximal RNA integrity. Remaining seedlings were used for post hoc analysis of morphological/growth differences. (B) Left: Example plate of a WT flight sample, which was imaged after thawing, but before seedling removal. Individual seedlings that could be distinguished from the bulk were marked with a blue arrow to mark the shoot meristem. The cotyledons of elongated petioles were marked with a red arrow and a red line used to connect the cotyledon to the meristem of the same seedling. Petioles were elongated compared with ground sample petioles [representative morphology of ground control presented in (A)]. WT, wild type. 3.2. Spaceflight results in an increase of total RNA RNA degradation has previously been observed in independent Arabidopsis spaceflight experiments performed in BRIC-PDFUs (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017). To test the RNA quality of our samples, we measured RIN as an indicator of overall RNA quality (RIN, 1 = low quality; 10 = high quality) of each sample and compared size peaks of 25S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) among samples (Mueller et al., 2004). Note that these measurements include smaller plastid rRNA peaks, which lower the maximum RIN value to around 8, independent of RNA quality (Babu and Gassmann, 2016). We established that all flight samples had RIN values between 7.5 and 8.0, indicating that RNA was of high quality. For ground samples, RIN values were found to be between 4.0 and 7.7, which would ordinarily indicate mild degradation of some samples. However, closer analyses revealed that, in nearly all ground samples (77%), the RIN algorithm failed to identify the correct peaks. In these samples, the algorithm identified the 18S rRNA peak as the 25S rRNA peak, and a putative organelle rRNA peak (Babu and Gassmann, 2016) as the 18S rRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, to compare RNA quality between treatments and genotypes from the Bioanalyzer data outputs, we used the ratio of 25S/18S peak heights as a substitute measure. Because the 25S peak height is reduced more quickly than the 18S peak in RNA-degrading conditions (e.g., elevated temperature, exogenous RNases, endogenous apoptotic RNase activity) (Mueller et al., 2004; Babu and Gassmann, 2016), a decreased 25S/18S ratio would indicate RNA degradation. We observed no significant differences of the 25S/18S ratio across all genotypes (Fig. 2A); therefore, both flight and ground samples had no significant RNA degradation. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab (A) Average ratio of 25S/18S peak heights as determined from Bioanalyzer traces from each sample was used as a secondary measure of RNA quality due to the RIN algorithms incorrect identification of the appropriate peaks. (B) The relative content of rRNA found in each genotype in both conditions was determined by comparing the height of the 25S peak with an organellular rRNA peak [18S (−3)], which was found in each sample. (C) Average RNA yields from each genotype from flight and ground samples. Statistical significance determined by Welch's t-test, p-value represented by not significant (NS) = >0.05; * = <0.05; ** = <0.005; *** = <0.0005. RIN, RNA integrity number.Interestingly, by comparing the 25S peak height with one of the two other peaks near the 18S peak [i.e., a putative organellular rRNA peak, designated 18S (−3); Supplementary Fig. S1] in each sample, it was clear that the relative ratio of 25S to 18S (−3) was significantly lower in the ground samples compared with flight samples (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). This low ratio indicates that the ground samples were depleted of nuclear-encoded rRNAs (i.e., 25S and 18S rRNAs) compared with other RNA species. This observation is also consistent with our findings that our ground samples contained significantly less total RNA [of which rRNA is a significant fraction (Lodish, 2000)] than flight samples (Fig. 2C). Because we extracted RNA from a similar number of seedlings from flight samples and ground samples, our results indicate that flight samples contained larger amount of total RNA compared with ground samples, which is likely to be caused by elevated levels of nuclear encoded rRNA in flight samples, and unlikely to be due to RNA degradation of the ground samples. 3.3. Global transcriptomic analyses indicate that gene expression reprogramming in response to spaceflight depends partially on intact UPR signaling Having established that the total RNA from ground and flight samples was of acceptable quality, we next proceeded to RNA-seq to investigate the impact of spaceflight on global gene expression changes in the UPR mutants. In RNA-seq library preparation, mRNA was enriched by purification to efficiently remove rRNA (Zhao et al., 2018) and mitigate potential sequencing bias due to higher rRNA levels in flight samples. We obtained an average of ∼32 million reads per sample, of which 95–99% were successfully mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients calculated between biological replicates showed a high reproducibility of our RNA-seq data set (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PCA exhibited a strong separation of ground samples from flight samples (Fig. 3B) and indicated that ground samples located more closely to each other than the flight samples. Overall, these analyses further supported a statistical robustness of the RNA-seq and justified further investigation. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab (A) Spearman's correlation coefficients demonstrate a close relationship between biological replicates. (B) Principal component analysis demonstrates a clear separation between flight and ground samples.To investigate gene expression changes in response to spaceflight, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each genotype by comparing gene expression values in ground and flight samples (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 3465 genes were classified as DEGs in at least one of the tested genotypes. WT had the largest number of DEGs (upregulated DEGs in flight compared with ground, n = 1675; downregulated DEGs, n = 831) among the genotypes tested. The bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs (upregulated DEGs, n = 1293; downregulated DEGs, n = 562) (Fig. 4A, B). In all genotypes, the number of upregulated DEGs was higher than that of downregulated DEGs (WT, 2.02-fold; atire1, 1.98-fold; bzip28, 2.28-fold; bzip60, 1.80-fold; bzip28 bzip60, 2.30-fold), indicating a higher impact of spaceflight on inducing gene expression rather than suppressing it. While the identity of 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated DEGs and 27.5% (335/1217) of downregulated DEGs overlapped across all genotypes, relatively smaller numbers of DEGs were found to be genotype-specific, ranging from 30 (downregulated exclusively in bzip28 bzip60) to 207 (upregulated in WT). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression analysis using the four biological replicates with the highest correlation was performed via HTseq v0.6.1pl and DESeq v2. For each genotype and for genes, DEGs in flight samples relative to ground samples were determined using a strict criterion: adjusted p-value <0.01; |log2FC| >1.5. Total number of upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) DEGs in each background was analyzed to determine what proportion was shared between the different genotypes. DEG, differentially expressed gene.In summary, based on the verified number of upregulated and downregulated DEGs in flight samples compared with ground samples across genotypes, the UPR mutants had consistently fewer overall DEGs than WT, indicating that the UPR could play at least a partial a role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control. 3.4. Biological pathways connected to the DEGs between flight and ground To gain insights in the biological pathways altered in spaceflight in our experimental setup, we performed separate GO analyses on upregulated and downregulated DEGs in WT (Supplementary Table S2), generating a list of parental-GO terms (more general, represented by a larger number of genes in the reference gene set) and cognate child-GO terms (more specific, smaller numbers of genes in the reference gene set) (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, we found that stress-responsive genes (e.g., “response to abscisic acid,” “response to hypoxia,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to oxidative stress”) as well as genes involved in physiological responses often associated with stress response adaptation were enriched in downregulated DEGs in WT. This result is consistent with previous studies that reported downregulation of water stress-related genes when using Arabidopsis BRIC-PDFU microarray transcriptomes (Johnson et al., 2017) and that found abscisic acid response and water stress response overrepresentation in misregulated DEGs in Col-0 WT with RNA-seq (Choi et al., 2019). In addition, we observed that metabolic processes associated with stress adaptation (Hildebrandt Tatjana et al., 2015; Batista-Silva et al., 2019), including amino acid catabolism and sucrose starvation response, were overrepresented in flight-downregulated DEGs. Ribosome biogenesis, translation, and gene expression processes were highly underrepresented in this category, that is, they were more likely to be upregulated by flight or remain unchanged. By further analyzing the normalized gene expression values (FPKM), we also found that ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing GO terms appeared significantly overrepresented in genes upregulated by >2-fold changes (flight/ground). These, however, were not considered as DEGs based on the strict statistical criteria applied in our analyses (see the Materials and Methods section). The lower FPKMs of ribosome biogenesis-related genes in ground control samples are consistent with our observations that the ground control samples were partially depleted of 25S and 18S rRNA compared with flight samples (Fig. 2C). FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Representative biological processes gene ontologies (GO terms) over- or underrepresented by upregulated or downregulated DEGs in the WT background. GO, Gene Ontology.We also found that GO terms enriched in upregulated DEGs included biological processes that have been noted in previous Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome analyses, such as secondary metabolite biosynthesis associated with defense responses (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Furthermore, we verified the dichotomous occurrence of the “absence of light” and “response to red or far red (R/FR) light response” GO terms in the downregulated and upregulated gene sets, respectively. The overrepresentation of photosynthetic components in upregulated DEGs is partially consistent with the results of a previous BRIC-PDFU experiment showing light/high light response and some photosynthesis-related genes to be differentially regulated in a subset of the tested genotypes (Choi et al., 2019). In addition to the findings consistent with previous spaceflight reports, we also observed a significant enrichment of DNA repair, DNA replication, and cell cycle pathways in the upregulated DEGs, which could be possibly associated with exposure of flight samples, but not ground samples, to ionizing radiation during spaceflight. Together, these results indicate that in our experimental conditions, spaceflight globally affects gene expression changes associated with a broad array of significant biological processes, largely identified also in previous spaceflight transcriptome studies (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). 3.5. The UPR regulators exert a minor but significant role on gene expression in spaceflight Next, we aimed to gain insights into the transcriptome changes caused by the absence of an intact UPR signaling in both ground and spaceflight conditions. To address it, we performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for all DEGs (n = 3465) obtained in at least one genotype (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S5) and then performed GO analysis to correlate the expression signature of each cluster with biological functions (Supplementary Table S4). Our clustering analysis suggested that variations in the identified DEGs between different genotypes (Fig. 4) were primarily the result of variable FPKM values in the ground control samples (Fig. 6). In flight, the FPKM values were roughly equalized to insignificantly different levels of expression across all genotypes. Of the 3465 DEGs, in the ground samples, 517 DEGs had FPKM values that were significantly different (p ≤ 0.01) in at least one UPR mutant compared with WT; however, in flight samples, only 144 genes had FPKM values that were significantly different in at least one UPR-mutant genotype compared with WT (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). FIG. 6. Open in a new tab K-means clustering analysis of all 3465 DEGs in at least 1 background. Each row represents fragments per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads values of an individual gene averaged between biological replicates. For each row, blue represents the minimum relative expression value, red the maximum expression value, and white is the middle value. For each cluster, GO biological process analysis of DEGs demonstrates a role for UPR regulation of ground control stress responses, which are largely repressed by flight. UPR, unfolded protein response.The largest cluster (Cluster 1 DEGs; n = 2299) consisted of DEGs upregulated to varying degrees in most of the genotypes tested. As such, a nearly identical set of GO terms that were enriched in upregulated DEGs in WT (Fig. 5) were also enriched in Cluster 1. We then compared the FPKM values of DEGs in ground samples across genotypes and found that 39.1% and 19.8% of DEGs in Cluster 1 were significantly different in the bzip60 and bzip28 bzip60, respectively, compared with WT, whereas only 4.6% and 2.9% of DEGs were significantly different in bzip28 and atire1, respectively, compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall, these results indicate that bZIP60 has functions that are independent of IRE1 and bZIP28, which in turn are required to downregulate Cluster 1 DEGs in ground control conditions. These observations are in accordance with the findings in ground conditions that bZIP28 and bZIP60 control some UPR target genes in an independent manner (Ruberti et al., 2018). In Cluster 2 (DEGs; n = 546), expression of DEGs was induced exclusively in ground bzip60 compared with other ground genotypes while highly suppressed to similar levels of expression in flight samples of all genotypes. As such, the proportion of DEGs in bzip60, whose expression was significantly different from WT, was much higher (17%) than other genotypes (bzip28 bzip60, 0.9%; bzip28, 1.0%; atire1, 1.2%) (Supplementary Fig. S4). We reasoned that bZIP28 and bZIP60 could have a negative feedback relationship in which the absence of bZIP28 suppressed the effect of bzip60 mutation exclusively in the ground condition. The overrepresented GO terms in Cluster 2 were largely similar to the GO terms enriched in the downregulated DEGs genes in the WT genotype: “response to abscisic acid,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to hypoxia” (Fig. 5). In addition, Cluster 2 DEGs showed significant enrichment of GO terms associated with biotic stress responses that were not found in analyses of the WT genotype (Fig. 5) or found to be strongly enriched in the any of the other clusters (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S4). These results indicate that bZIP60 may have repressive roles in regulating genes involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses. The gene expression pattern of Cluster 3 (DEGs; n = 274) was also characterized largely by genes with lower expression values in spaceflight compared with ground control across genotypes, except for bzip28. However, contrasting with Cluster 2, the FPKM values in the bzip60 genotype was not different from WT FPKM values; only 3.2% of DEGs showed significant different FPKM compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. S4). Instead, the absence of bZIP28 (i.e., in the bzip28 mutant) had a higher impact on gene expression in the ground condition compared with other mutants (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, these Cluster 3 DEGs had intermediate FPKM values in the bzip28 bzip60 genotype in ground control compared with the extremes of the bzip60 and bzip28 single mutants, indicating an antagonistic regulation of bZIP28 and bZIP60 on these genes in the ground condition, which was largely compensated for in the bzip28 bzip60 genotype. Similar to Clusters 2 and 3, Cluster 4 (DEGs; n = 55) contained genes, whose expression exhibited overall lower FPKMs in spaceflight compared with ground across genotypes. However, Cluster 4 showed a unique pattern: the expression of the DEGs in this cluster was significantly lower in bzip60 compared with WT and the other genotypes in the ground condition (Supplementary Fig. S4) and showed no prominent differences across genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Although Cluster 4 was not significantly represented by any biological process GO terms, a closer analysis revealed that 22% of all DEGs in this cluster were encoded on the mitochondrial genome; mitochondria-encoded genes comprise only 0.5% of all protein-coding genes in the Arabidopsis genome annotation (https://www.arabidopsis.org) and 0.3% of DEGs called in this study. Cluster 5 (DEGs; n = 291) showed a gene expression pattern similar to Cluster 2 with significantly higher levels in the bzip60 genotype compared with the other genotypes in the ground control samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). In this Cluster, the DEGs were more affected by the absence of bZIP28 (bzip28 bzip60 and bzip28) in the ground condition compared with Cluster 2. The GO term “response to water deprivation,” which was found to be enriched in Cluster 2, was significantly enriched in Cluster 5. In addition, relatively narrow child GO terms “toxin catabolic process” and “glutathione metabolic process,” which were not enriched in other clusters, were enriched in Cluster 5. Overall, by comparing the bzip60 and bzip28 single mutants with the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant, our transcriptomic profiling provides evidence for a highly complex, unconventional, regulatory relationship between bZIP60 and bZIP28 under the conditions experienced by ground control seedlings. Furthermore, a small number of significant differences between WT and the UPR mutants in spaceflight were found, supporting a small but significant role of the UPR in gene expression in spaceflight.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to spaceflight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments. We utilized the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to compare the transcriptional responses with the spaceflight between A. thaliana WT and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP60, bZIP28, and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1. The BRIC-PDFU hardware has been employed in a number of dark-grown Arabidopsis transcriptome experiments toward different aims (Paul et al., 2012; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Variability in technical experimental details and limited overlap between spaceflight/ground DEGs has been verified even between the same WT control genotype in simultaneous experiments (Johnson et al., 2017). However, some broad biological pathways have been found to be induced or repressed in response to spaceflight, including cell wall modification, response to light/high light, oxidative stress, osmotic stress response, heat shock, and biotic defense/secondary metabolite synthesis (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Many of these responses were also noted in our study, including the downregulation of water stress response in space, which has been identified in four separate experiments (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). However, we also observed correlative differences in seedling growth and an overall gene expression landscape not noted in previous studies. Our ground control seedlings had grown in a predictable manner, consistent with the expected morphology of terrestrially grown Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyls (Fig. 1). Flight sample growth was also largely in line with expectations for seedlings grown in microgravity, including the observed petiole elongation, which was shared in all flight samples. Indeed, a petiole elongation of flight samples was also present in the images published of dark-grown Arabidopsis experiments in the Col-0 background in previous experiments (Johnson et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2017). This growth phenotype is consistent with low R/FR ratio and shade avoidance syndrome mediated by phytochrome signaling (Franklin, 2008). The correlative responses observed in the transcriptome analysis (Fig. 4) support that differentially regulated growth phenotypes and the large transcriptional rearrangements in flight during our experiment might have been mediated by phytochrome-related signaling, which is also known to constitutively repress abscisic acid signaling (Yang et al., 2016), and were found to be repressed in our flight samples. However, these differences in the response to light and the increased expression of photosynthetic components between ground and flight samples are anomalous when considering the spaceflight culture methods used in this study. BRIC-PDFUs are autoclavable, black polymer containers, which are sealed with metal lids during science integration, and allow injection of the chemical preservative without opening the unit. After being sealed on August 12, the seeds and seedlings germinated from these seeds in the BRICs were not exposed to light during the launch and the 14-day growth period on the ISS. Therefore, the dichotomous occurrence of the “absence of light” overrepresentation in downregulated and of “response to R/FR light response” in upregulated DEGs is unlikely to be the result of actual differential exposure to light. One likely explanation is related to the hypocotyl-tissue media contact that occurred in our flight samples, which lacked a clear growth vector in microgravity, but had not occurred in our ground samples where roots grew perpendicular into the media. In previous experiments by Johnson et al. (2015) and Paul et al. (2017), the dark-grown ground control plates were oriented vertically and both sample sets displayed petiole elongation, although the precise differences in length or extent of petiole elongation between flight and ground were not quantified. How media contact could induce R/FR light signaling in the dark is not immediately obvious; however, earlier studies showed that media containing sucrose modulated the R/FR signaling mediated by phytochrome A, promoting a red light response (Dijkwel et al., 1997). Coincidentally, the higher rRNA and RNA content observed in flight samples compared with ground control samples in our study (Fig. 2) is also consistent with an increased exposure of cells to sucrose or glucose, which is known to induce RNA accumulation, rRNA transcription, and ribosome biogenesis in plants (Kojima et al., 2007; Ishida et al., 2016), yeast (Kunkel et al., 2019), and mammals (Hannan et al., 2003). Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the remote possibility that our observations may be influenced by possible interactions between ionizing radiation and phytochrome R/FR signaling. For example, low-dose gamma (γ) irradiation of lettuce seeds was found to mimic the effects of FR deactivation of red light-activated phytochromes (Hsiao and Vidaver, 1974). Additionally, a structural study of the bacterial phytochrome from the radiation-resistant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans established that X-ray radiation induced deprotonation of chromophore in the inactive phytochrome, a biochemical step thought to be involved in light-induced activation of this protein (Li et al., 2015). Although the dose required to deprotonate 50% of the phytochrome (Li et al., 2015) was orders of magnitude larger than that expected to be experienced during our experimental period on the ISS, differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytochromes could affect relevant properties of a hypothetical phytochrome–radiation interaction. Interpreting a role for the UPR in the transcriptional response to spaceflight is complicated. We observed clear differences in the number of spaceflight DEGs in the UPR-mutant backgrounds compared with WT (Fig. 4); and only 1118 of the 3465 DEGs were common to all genotypes. This would normally suggest that the transcriptional readjustments that occurred in response to spaceflight were at least partially the result of UPR-dependent processes. However, upon closer analysis of the underlying FPKM values, it became clear that the differences in fold change values (flight/ground) across genotypes were more heavily influenced by the differential regulation of expression in the ground samples by the UPR regulators (Fig. 6). The number of DEGs with FPKM values significantly different from WT FPKM values in at least one UPR-mutant genotype was four times greater in the ground samples compared with flight samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). The heat map visualization of these values (Fig. 6) further suggests that the variations in ground samples expression levels were largely muted by spaceflight, as the endpoint transcript levels in flight samples were nearly uniform in the different genotypes. Overall, this would suggest that the UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight. One explanation for this observation may be related to the concerted downregulation of many stress-responsive processes in the flight samples compared with the ground samples (Fig. 6). In spaceflight conditions, it seems likely that alternative signaling pathways are actuated, which repress the observed stress responses regulated by the UPR. Given the prevalence of starvation responses in ground samples, it is possible that microgravity-induced changes in growth habit provide better nutrient availability (Fig. 7). As such, plants in flight may be able to better handle the stresses imposed by culture conditions, without requiring UPR regulator involvement. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab (A) Hypothesized regulatory framework for stress-responsive DEGs found to be regulated by the UPR on the ground but not in flight conditions. Possible interactions between bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the regulation of DEGs were found in (B) Clusters 2 and 5, (C) Cluster 3, and (D) Cluster 4. Nonetheless, the observations related to an interaction between the UPR regulators bZIP60 and bZIP28 and the stresses imposed on ground control seedlings have yielded important information, which should be explored in the future. In the canonical ER stress response induced chemically or via environmental stress, bZIP60 and bZIP28 TFs interact in the nucleus and direct the actions of the COMPASS DNA methylation complex to increase transcription of target genes (Song et al., 2015). Furthermore, these TFs can also bind independently to gene promoters to activate downstream UPR genes, as evidenced by the weaker activation of ER chaperones in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant compared with either of the bzip28 or bzip60 single mutants (Ruberti et al., 2018; this work). Although it has been suggested that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may also have unique target genes (Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019), in our ground control samples, the transcriptomic data suggest that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have a more complex antagonistic relationship in the control of genes related to the response to abscisic acid, hypoxia, water deprivation, and to oxidative stress (Fig. 6). In Clusters 2 and 5, and Cluster 4, we observed that the expression levels of the DEGs were higher or lower than WT in the bzip60 genotype, respectively (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). However, these differences were not observed in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant as would be expected. Conversely, in Cluster 3, we observed in ground samples that the expression levels of the DEGs were sharply lower in the bzip28 genotype compared with WT. In the bzip28 bzip60 genotype, the genes in Cluster 3 had expression levels that were higher than the bzip28 genotype but were also lower than those of these genes in the WT or bzip60 genotypes. In response to chemically induced UPR conditions, bZIP60 and bZIP28 cooperatively upregulate several UPR genes (Song et al., 2015; Ruberti et al., 2018). In our ground controls, the stress-responsive genes, largely represented by “response to abscisic acid,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to hypoxia” abiotic stress responses, were regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60 in a way that suggests that these TFs have antagonistic regulatory effects on these processes (Fig. 7B–D). The exact nature of the stress experienced by the ground control seedlings would need to be elucidated to better understand the impact of this information on agronomic and/or spaceflight applications. Studies on the effect of plant growth in BRIC-PDFUs have already established that significant stress may be imposed on the seedlings grown in these conditions (Johnson et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017). Consistent with our results, other BRIC-PDFU transcriptomes have found a downregulation of genes related to water stress responses (Johnson et al., 2017). However, as evaporative water loss from the BRIC-PDFUs is unlikely because they are sealed containers, the strongly represented GO terms related to “response to water deprivation” and “response to abscisic acid” are unlikely to be a direct response to actual water loss from the plates. Instead, it may be possible that the ground seedlings with etiolated hypocotyls that are not in contact with the media or have less overall contact with the media are water stressed compared with flight seedlings that are in direct contact or have penetrated the media. Independent of the underlying stimulus for the observed differences, the possibility that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have antagonistic interactions related to control of abscisic acid signaling or water deprivation responses should be investigated at the molecular level in the future to improve plant growth and stress responses in space and on the ground.",

Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers  Copyright notice ID: 7987364 PMID: 33325797 Abstract Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks. Key Words: Spaceflight, Unfolded protein response, Arabidopsis, Microgravity.1. Introduction Extraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferl et al., 2002; Massa et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paul et al., 2013). Recent iterations of the sophisticated chamber hardware for plant growth housed on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for multigenerational plant growth in space and analyses of plant responses to this environment (Massa et al., 2016). However, these facilities are insufficient for large-scale plant growth on extraterrestrial environments due to their size and resource cost. Therefore, generation of germplasm adapted to stresses experienced during growth in extraterrestrial environments is a critical contribution to the realization of sustainable plant cultivation in space. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses. The UPR is generally activated by a buildup of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition known as ER stress (Ron and Walter, 2007). The ER stress sensors conserved across metazoans and plants include the ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and ER membrane-tethered transcription factors (TFs) (metazoan activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and plant basic leucine zipper 17 [bZIP17] and bZIP28). Activation of IRE1 leads to unconventional splicing of an intron from the mRNA of an IRE1-downstream bZIP-TF (metazoan X-box binding protein 1 and plant bZIP60). The UPR TFs are translocated to the nucleus to control expression of UPR target genes and restore ER homeostasis (Koizumi et al., 2001; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Halbleib et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018; Ruberti et al., 2018; Tam et al., 2018; Mishiba et al., 2019; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Pu et al., 2019). Insufficient UPR leads to the actuation of cell death (Ron and Walter, 2007; Walter and Ron, 2011). In terrestrially grown plants, the UPR is a key mediator of responses to a variety of stresses, including heat, pathogen, and high light/singlet oxygen (Deng et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2012; Guillemette et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019; Beaugelin et al., 2020). Additionally, analyses of higher order UPR mutants have demonstrated that the UPR regulators are necessary for post-embryonic growth and reproductive development in Arabidopsis under unstressed conditions as well (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Kim et al., 2018; Mishiba et al., 2019; Pu et al., 2019). Therefore, a better understanding of the UPR can enable efforts to potentiate plant stress responses and improve plant yield. Given the broad responsiveness of the UPR to environmental stresses, we hypothesized that the UPR effectors could coordinate gene expression reprogramming in spaceflight stress conditions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed global gene expression changes in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis as well as loss-of-function mutants of IRE1 (ire1a ire1b, herein dubbed ire1), bZIP28, and bZIP60 (single and double mutants: bzip28, bzip60, bzip28 bzip60), cultivated in orbit during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to the ISS. We used these genetic backgrounds to identify genes controlled jointly or specifically by the UPR sensors and UPR TFs and define the extent to which the known signaling pathways of the UPR functionally interact in a whole organism under microgravity-associated conditions. We established that, in space and on ground, gene expression undergoes a substantial reprogramming on a genome-scale. Growth in orbit substantially altered the expression of thousands of genes associated with significant biological traits compared with ground controls. However, while many of these spaceflight-responsive genes were regulated uniquely in certain UPR mutants compared with WT in the ground control, such a genotype-specific regulation was not observed in the spaceflight condition. These observations not only provide new insight into how plants respond to spaceflight, but also establish that spaceflight-induced transcriptional responses mitigate the need for the gene-regulatory networks controlled by the UPR sensors.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Launch hardware and experimental timeline This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period. PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with a tissue fixative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at the conclusion of the flight experiment. An identical set of samples was prepared and grown on Earth with a 2-day offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental Simulator to allow for data transmission and reproduction of incubation conditions experienced by flight samples in orbit. HOBO data loggers equipped with temperature sensors were integrated into two of the four BRICs to record temperatures experienced by samples during the experiment for post hoc analysis. Launch samples (i.e., Arabidopsis seeds) were integrated into BRIC flight hardware in a sterile hood ∼48 h before the August 14, 2017, launch of SpaceX CRS12 spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4°C to maintain seed dormancy before packing in cold storage bags while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch. After docking, samples were removed from cold storage bags by ISS astronauts, warmed to ambient ISS temperature, allowing seed germination and experiment initiation in the BRIC. After 14 days, ISS astronauts actuated PDFUs, which were then incubated at room temperature for a further 3 h before being transferred to the ISS −80 MELFI freezer. Samples were kept at approximately −80°C until BRICs were conditioned to −32°C in double cold bag storage (Hutchison and Campana, 2009) and stowed in the Dragon capsule before undocking and atmospheric reentry on September 16. After returning to KSC, samples were stored at −80°C until de-integration of the flight and ground samples. De-integration occurred on November 1, 2017.2.2. Germplasm and culture conditions Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the following genotypes were used for flight and ground controls: WT (Col-0 ecotype), atire1 (Nagashima et al., 2011; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012), bzip60 (Moreno et al., 2012), bzip28 (Gao et al., 2008), and bzip28 bzip60 (Deng et al., 2013). Petri dishes (60 mm) were prepared with 6.7 mL of sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with Gamborg's B5 Vitamins (PhytoTechnology Laboratories), 0.5% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.7. In a sterile hood, seeds of WT and UPR-mutant genotypes were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then nine additional washes with sterile H2O distilled twice. After the final wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in 1.5 mL sterile water for wet plating by using a 1 mL pipette equipped with sterile filter tip. For each experimental unit (flight and ground control), five plate replicates of WT and bzip28/bzip60 genotypes and four plate replicates of atire1, bzip28, and bzip60 genotypes were prepared. Each plate replicate contained 70–80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid pattern on the plate surface. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm (Heathrow Scientific), and individual plates were then wrapped twice with sterile aluminum foil. Individually wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC configuration and wrapped together with two more layers of sterile aluminum foil before sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were placed at 4°C until the integration of samples into science hardware the following morning.2.3. Sample processing and experimental material assessment Samples of flight and ground control experiments were preserved in RNAlater in situ and kept at −80°C (see the Results section for experimental timeline). The Petri dishes were removed from packaging and thawed in groups of three to prevent excess exposure to room temperature during sample collection. After removing most of the RNAlater from the plates, sterile forceps were used to transfer seedlings from the plates to microcentrifuge tubes containing two glass beads. Seedlings were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. This procedure was carried out quickly to maximize RNA recovery. Accordingly, only some pictures were taken of plates before extraction for example purposes. Most pictures were taken after the bulk of the sample was removed, with the remaining seedlings also imaged for post hoc inspection. All plates were free from any visible evidence of bacterial or fungal contamination. Frozen samples were ground to a powder with a Retsch Mixer Mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany). RNA was extracted from tissues by using a NucleoSpin RNA Plant Kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions including DNase digestion. The overall quality and RNA integrity number (RIN) of RNA samples were assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).2.4. Library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed by using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced in single-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (50-nt) at Research Technology Support Facility Genomics Core at Michigan State University. For each library, read quality was assessed with the FastQC (version 0.11.3) software (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Reads were cleaned for quality and adapter sequences with Cutadapt (version1.8.1) using a minimum base quality 20 retaining reads with a minimum length of 30 nucleotides after trimming (Martin, 2011). Quality-filtered reads were aligned to the Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10) with Bowtie (version 2.3.1) and TopHat (version 2.1.1) with a 10 bp minimum intron length and 15,000 bp maximum intron length (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Fragments per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) were measured by using TAIR10 gene model annotation with Cufflinks (version 1.3.0) (Trapnell et al., 2010). The log2 transformed and normalized gene expression levels (FPKM +1) were used for correlation analysis (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) between biological replicates and principal component analysis (PCA). Per-gene read counts were identified with HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) in the union mode with a minimum mapping quality of 20 with stranded reverse counting (Anders et al., 2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed in four biological replicates (for WT and bzip28 bzip60, selected based on the correlation with other biological replicates) with DESeq2 (version 1.16.1) within R (version 3.4.0) based on a comparison of spaceflight to ground with adjusted p-value <0.01 and absolute log2-transformed fold change >1.5 (Love et al., 2014). Genes of which the total count across all samples is <100 were not included in the analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) overrepresentation was performed with PANTHER (Fisher's exact type with false discovery rate correction) (www.pantherdb.org) (Mi et al., 2019a, 2019b). K-means clustering analysis on average FPKM values from biological replicates was performed using the Morpheus tool (Morpheus, https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The optimal number of K-means clusters was determined with the factoextra package in R.3. Results 3.1. Spaceflight alters the growth of seedlings independent of an intact UPR signaling When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings (atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60) of the ground control and flight samples at the completion of the mission, we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hypocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light) were above the surface of the solidified media while roots had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1A). However, in flight samples, we found that etiolated hypocotyls as well as roots had generally penetrated the growth medium regardless of genotype tested (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we also observed that cotyledon petioles of flight sample seedlings were elongated (Fig. 1B) compared with ground control seedlings (Fig. 1A). Overall, these observations are consistent with plant growth in the darkness and space, conditions leading to elongated hypocotyls and petioles, and a lack of directional growth, respectively (Paul et al., 2017). These observations also suggest that the UPR unlikely exerts a noticeable role in growth direction in response to altered gravity levels. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab (A) Representative ground and flight sample plates were imaged after the bulk of etiolated hypocotyls, and RNAlater was removed to ensure maximal RNA integrity. Remaining seedlings were used for post hoc analysis of morphological/growth differences. (B) Left: Example plate of a WT flight sample, which was imaged after thawing, but before seedling removal. Individual seedlings that could be distinguished from the bulk were marked with a blue arrow to mark the shoot meristem. The cotyledons of elongated petioles were marked with a red arrow and a red line used to connect the cotyledon to the meristem of the same seedling. Petioles were elongated compared with ground sample petioles [representative morphology of ground control presented in (A)]. WT, wild type.3.2. Spaceflight results in an increase of total RNA RNA degradation has previously been observed in independent Arabidopsis spaceflight experiments performed in BRIC-PDFUs (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017). To test the RNA quality of our samples, we measured RIN as an indicator of overall RNA quality (RIN, 1 = low quality; 10 = high quality) of each sample and compared size peaks of 25S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) among samples (Mueller et al., 2004). Note that these measurements include smaller plastid rRNA peaks, which lower the maximum RIN value to around 8, independent of RNA quality (Babu and Gassmann, 2016). We established that all flight samples had RIN values between 7.5 and 8.0, indicating that RNA was of high quality. For ground samples, RIN values were found to be between 4.0 and 7.7, which would ordinarily indicate mild degradation of some samples. However, closer analyses revealed that, in nearly all ground samples (77%), the RIN algorithm failed to identify the correct peaks. In these samples, the algorithm identified the 18S rRNA peak as the 25S rRNA peak, and a putative organelle rRNA peak (Babu and Gassmann, 2016) as the 18S rRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, to compare RNA quality between treatments and genotypes from the Bioanalyzer data outputs, we used the ratio of 25S/18S peak heights as a substitute measure. Because the 25S peak height is reduced more quickly than the 18S peak in RNA-degrading conditions (e.g., elevated temperature, exogenous RNases, endogenous apoptotic RNase activity) (Mueller et al., 2004; Babu and Gassmann, 2016), a decreased 25S/18S ratio would indicate RNA degradation. We observed no significant differences of the 25S/18S ratio across all genotypes (Fig. 2A); therefore, both flight and ground samples had no significant RNA degradation. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab (A) Average ratio of 25S/18S peak heights as determined from Bioanalyzer traces from each sample was used as a secondary measure of RNA quality due to the RIN algorithms incorrect identification of the appropriate peaks. (B) The relative content of rRNA found in each genotype in both conditions was determined by comparing the height of the 25S peak with an organellular rRNA peak [18S (−3)], which was found in each sample. (C) Average RNA yields from each genotype from flight and ground samples. Statistical significance determined by Welch's t-test, p-value represented by not significant (NS) = >0.05; * = <0.05; ** = <0.005; *** = <0.0005. RIN, RNA integrity number.Interestingly, by comparing the 25S peak height with one of the two other peaks near the 18S peak [i.e., a putative organellular rRNA peak, designated 18S (−3); Supplementary Fig. S1] in each sample, it was clear that the relative ratio of 25S to 18S (−3) was significantly lower in the ground samples compared with flight samples (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). This low ratio indicates that the ground samples were depleted of nuclear-encoded rRNAs (i.e., 25S and 18S rRNAs) compared with other RNA species. This observation is also consistent with our findings that our ground samples contained significantly less total RNA [of which rRNA is a significant fraction (Lodish, 2000)] than flight samples (Fig. 2C). Because we extracted RNA from a similar number of seedlings from flight samples and ground samples, our results indicate that flight samples contained larger amount of total RNA compared with ground samples, which is likely to be caused by elevated levels of nuclear encoded rRNA in flight samples, and unlikely to be due to RNA degradation of the ground samples.3.3. Global transcriptomic analyses indicate that gene expression reprogramming in response to spaceflight depends partially on intact UPR signaling Having established that the total RNA from ground and flight samples was of acceptable quality, we next proceeded to RNA-seq to investigate the impact of spaceflight on global gene expression changes in the UPR mutants. In RNA-seq library preparation, mRNA was enriched by purification to efficiently remove rRNA (Zhao et al., 2018) and mitigate potential sequencing bias due to higher rRNA levels in flight samples. We obtained an average of ∼32 million reads per sample, of which 95–99% were successfully mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients calculated between biological replicates showed a high reproducibility of our RNA-seq data set (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PCA exhibited a strong separation of ground samples from flight samples (Fig. 3B) and indicated that ground samples located more closely to each other than the flight samples. Overall, these analyses further supported a statistical robustness of the RNA-seq and justified further investigation. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab (A) Spearman's correlation coefficients demonstrate a close relationship between biological replicates. (B) Principal component analysis demonstrates a clear separation between flight and ground samples.To investigate gene expression changes in response to spaceflight, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each genotype by comparing gene expression values in ground and flight samples (Supplementary Table S1). A total of 3465 genes were classified as DEGs in at least one of the tested genotypes. WT had the largest number of DEGs (upregulated DEGs in flight compared with ground, n = 1675; downregulated DEGs, n = 831) among the genotypes tested. The bzip28 bzip60 mutant had the smallest number of DEGs (upregulated DEGs, n = 1293; downregulated DEGs, n = 562) (Fig. 4A, B). In all genotypes, the number of upregulated DEGs was higher than that of downregulated DEGs (WT, 2.02-fold; atire1, 1.98-fold; bzip28, 2.28-fold; bzip60, 1.80-fold; bzip28 bzip60, 2.30-fold), indicating a higher impact of spaceflight on inducing gene expression rather than suppressing it. While the identity of 34.8% (783/2249) of upregulated DEGs and 27.5% (335/1217) of downregulated DEGs overlapped across all genotypes, relatively smaller numbers of DEGs were found to be genotype-specific, ranging from 30 (downregulated exclusively in bzip28 bzip60) to 207 (upregulated in WT). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression analysis using the four biological replicates with the highest correlation was performed via HTseq v0.6.1pl and DESeq v2. For each genotype and for genes, DEGs in flight samples relative to ground samples were determined using a strict criterion: adjusted p-value <0.01; |log2FC| >1.5. Total number of upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) DEGs in each background was analyzed to determine what proportion was shared between the different genotypes. DEG, differentially expressed gene.In summary, based on the verified number of upregulated and downregulated DEGs in flight samples compared with ground samples across genotypes, the UPR mutants had consistently fewer overall DEGs than WT, indicating that the UPR could play at least a partial a role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control.3.4. Biological pathways connected to the DEGs between flight and ground To gain insights in the biological pathways altered in spaceflight in our experimental setup, we performed separate GO analyses on upregulated and downregulated DEGs in WT (Supplementary Table S2), generating a list of parental-GO terms (more general, represented by a larger number of genes in the reference gene set) and cognate child-GO terms (more specific, smaller numbers of genes in the reference gene set) (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, we found that stress-responsive genes (e.g., “response to abscisic acid,” “response to hypoxia,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to oxidative stress”) as well as genes involved in physiological responses often associated with stress response adaptation were enriched in downregulated DEGs in WT. This result is consistent with previous studies that reported downregulation of water stress-related genes when using Arabidopsis BRIC-PDFU microarray transcriptomes (Johnson et al., 2017) and that found abscisic acid response and water stress response overrepresentation in misregulated DEGs in Col-0 WT with RNA-seq (Choi et al., 2019). In addition, we observed that metabolic processes associated with stress adaptation (Hildebrandt Tatjana et al., 2015; Batista-Silva et al., 2019), including amino acid catabolism and sucrose starvation response, were overrepresented in flight-downregulated DEGs. Ribosome biogenesis, translation, and gene expression processes were highly underrepresented in this category, that is, they were more likely to be upregulated by flight or remain unchanged. By further analyzing the normalized gene expression values (FPKM), we also found that ribosome biogenesis and rRNA processing GO terms appeared significantly overrepresented in genes upregulated by >2-fold changes (flight/ground). These, however, were not considered as DEGs based on the strict statistical criteria applied in our analyses (see the Materials and Methods section). The lower FPKMs of ribosome biogenesis-related genes in ground control samples are consistent with our observations that the ground control samples were partially depleted of 25S and 18S rRNA compared with flight samples (Fig. 2C). FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Representative biological processes gene ontologies (GO terms) over- or underrepresented by upregulated or downregulated DEGs in the WT background. GO, Gene Ontology.We also found that GO terms enriched in upregulated DEGs included biological processes that have been noted in previous Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome analyses, such as secondary metabolite biosynthesis associated with defense responses (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Furthermore, we verified the dichotomous occurrence of the “absence of light” and “response to red or far red (R/FR) light response” GO terms in the downregulated and upregulated gene sets, respectively. The overrepresentation of photosynthetic components in upregulated DEGs is partially consistent with the results of a previous BRIC-PDFU experiment showing light/high light response and some photosynthesis-related genes to be differentially regulated in a subset of the tested genotypes (Choi et al., 2019). In addition to the findings consistent with previous spaceflight reports, we also observed a significant enrichment of DNA repair, DNA replication, and cell cycle pathways in the upregulated DEGs, which could be possibly associated with exposure of flight samples, but not ground samples, to ionizing radiation during spaceflight. Together, these results indicate that in our experimental conditions, spaceflight globally affects gene expression changes associated with a broad array of significant biological processes, largely identified also in previous spaceflight transcriptome studies (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019).3.5. The UPR regulators exert a minor but significant role on gene expression in spaceflight Next, we aimed to gain insights into the transcriptome changes caused by the absence of an intact UPR signaling in both ground and spaceflight conditions. To address it, we performed K-means clustering analysis on FPKM values for all DEGs (n = 3465) obtained in at least one genotype (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S5) and then performed GO analysis to correlate the expression signature of each cluster with biological functions (Supplementary Table S4). Our clustering analysis suggested that variations in the identified DEGs between different genotypes (Fig. 4) were primarily the result of variable FPKM values in the ground control samples (Fig. 6). In flight, the FPKM values were roughly equalized to insignificantly different levels of expression across all genotypes. Of the 3465 DEGs, in the ground samples, 517 DEGs had FPKM values that were significantly different (p ≤ 0.01) in at least one UPR mutant compared with WT; however, in flight samples, only 144 genes had FPKM values that were significantly different in at least one UPR-mutant genotype compared with WT (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). FIG. 6. Open in a new tab K-means clustering analysis of all 3465 DEGs in at least 1 background. Each row represents fragments per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads values of an individual gene averaged between biological replicates. For each row, blue represents the minimum relative expression value, red the maximum expression value, and white is the middle value. For each cluster, GO biological process analysis of DEGs demonstrates a role for UPR regulation of ground control stress responses, which are largely repressed by flight. UPR, unfolded protein response.The largest cluster (Cluster 1 DEGs; n = 2299) consisted of DEGs upregulated to varying degrees in most of the genotypes tested. As such, a nearly identical set of GO terms that were enriched in upregulated DEGs in WT (Fig. 5) were also enriched in Cluster 1. We then compared the FPKM values of DEGs in ground samples across genotypes and found that 39.1% and 19.8% of DEGs in Cluster 1 were significantly different in the bzip60 and bzip28 bzip60, respectively, compared with WT, whereas only 4.6% and 2.9% of DEGs were significantly different in bzip28 and atire1, respectively, compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overall, these results indicate that bZIP60 has functions that are independent of IRE1 and bZIP28, which in turn are required to downregulate Cluster 1 DEGs in ground control conditions. These observations are in accordance with the findings in ground conditions that bZIP28 and bZIP60 control some UPR target genes in an independent manner (Ruberti et al., 2018). In Cluster 2 (DEGs; n = 546), expression of DEGs was induced exclusively in ground bzip60 compared with other ground genotypes while highly suppressed to similar levels of expression in flight samples of all genotypes. As such, the proportion of DEGs in bzip60, whose expression was significantly different from WT, was much higher (17%) than other genotypes (bzip28 bzip60, 0.9%; bzip28, 1.0%; atire1, 1.2%) (Supplementary Fig. S4). We reasoned that bZIP28 and bZIP60 could have a negative feedback relationship in which the absence of bZIP28 suppressed the effect of bzip60 mutation exclusively in the ground condition. The overrepresented GO terms in Cluster 2 were largely similar to the GO terms enriched in the downregulated DEGs genes in the WT genotype: “response to abscisic acid,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to hypoxia” (Fig. 5). In addition, Cluster 2 DEGs showed significant enrichment of GO terms associated with biotic stress responses that were not found in analyses of the WT genotype (Fig. 5) or found to be strongly enriched in the any of the other clusters (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S4). These results indicate that bZIP60 may have repressive roles in regulating genes involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses. The gene expression pattern of Cluster 3 (DEGs; n = 274) was also characterized largely by genes with lower expression values in spaceflight compared with ground control across genotypes, except for bzip28. However, contrasting with Cluster 2, the FPKM values in the bzip60 genotype was not different from WT FPKM values; only 3.2% of DEGs showed significant different FPKM compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. S4). Instead, the absence of bZIP28 (i.e., in the bzip28 mutant) had a higher impact on gene expression in the ground condition compared with other mutants (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, these Cluster 3 DEGs had intermediate FPKM values in the bzip28 bzip60 genotype in ground control compared with the extremes of the bzip60 and bzip28 single mutants, indicating an antagonistic regulation of bZIP28 and bZIP60 on these genes in the ground condition, which was largely compensated for in the bzip28 bzip60 genotype. Similar to Clusters 2 and 3, Cluster 4 (DEGs; n = 55) contained genes, whose expression exhibited overall lower FPKMs in spaceflight compared with ground across genotypes. However, Cluster 4 showed a unique pattern: the expression of the DEGs in this cluster was significantly lower in bzip60 compared with WT and the other genotypes in the ground condition (Supplementary Fig. S4) and showed no prominent differences across genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Although Cluster 4 was not significantly represented by any biological process GO terms, a closer analysis revealed that 22% of all DEGs in this cluster were encoded on the mitochondrial genome; mitochondria-encoded genes comprise only 0.5% of all protein-coding genes in the Arabidopsis genome annotation (https://www.arabidopsis.org) and 0.3% of DEGs called in this study. Cluster 5 (DEGs; n = 291) showed a gene expression pattern similar to Cluster 2 with significantly higher levels in the bzip60 genotype compared with the other genotypes in the ground control samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). In this Cluster, the DEGs were more affected by the absence of bZIP28 (bzip28 bzip60 and bzip28) in the ground condition compared with Cluster 2. The GO term “response to water deprivation,” which was found to be enriched in Cluster 2, was significantly enriched in Cluster 5. In addition, relatively narrow child GO terms “toxin catabolic process” and “glutathione metabolic process,” which were not enriched in other clusters, were enriched in Cluster 5. Overall, by comparing the bzip60 and bzip28 single mutants with the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant, our transcriptomic profiling provides evidence for a highly complex, unconventional, regulatory relationship between bZIP60 and bZIP28 under the conditions experienced by ground control seedlings. Furthermore, a small number of significant differences between WT and the UPR mutants in spaceflight were found, supporting a small but significant role of the UPR in gene expression in spaceflight.4. Discussion In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to spaceflight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments. We utilized the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to compare the transcriptional responses with the spaceflight between A. thaliana WT and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP60, bZIP28, and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1. The BRIC-PDFU hardware has been employed in a number of dark-grown Arabidopsis transcriptome experiments toward different aims (Paul et al., 2012; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Variability in technical experimental details and limited overlap between spaceflight/ground DEGs has been verified even between the same WT control genotype in simultaneous experiments (Johnson et al., 2017). However, some broad biological pathways have been found to be induced or repressed in response to spaceflight, including cell wall modification, response to light/high light, oxidative stress, osmotic stress response, heat shock, and biotic defense/secondary metabolite synthesis (Paul et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). Many of these responses were also noted in our study, including the downregulation of water stress response in space, which has been identified in four separate experiments (Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019). However, we also observed correlative differences in seedling growth and an overall gene expression landscape not noted in previous studies. Our ground control seedlings had grown in a predictable manner, consistent with the expected morphology of terrestrially grown Arabidopsis etiolated hypocotyls (Fig. 1). Flight sample growth was also largely in line with expectations for seedlings grown in microgravity, including the observed petiole elongation, which was shared in all flight samples. Indeed, a petiole elongation of flight samples was also present in the images published of dark-grown Arabidopsis experiments in the Col-0 background in previous experiments (Johnson et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2017). This growth phenotype is consistent with low R/FR ratio and shade avoidance syndrome mediated by phytochrome signaling (Franklin, 2008). The correlative responses observed in the transcriptome analysis (Fig. 4) support that differentially regulated growth phenotypes and the large transcriptional rearrangements in flight during our experiment might have been mediated by phytochrome-related signaling, which is also known to constitutively repress abscisic acid signaling (Yang et al., 2016), and were found to be repressed in our flight samples. However, these differences in the response to light and the increased expression of photosynthetic components between ground and flight samples are anomalous when considering the spaceflight culture methods used in this study. BRIC-PDFUs are autoclavable, black polymer containers, which are sealed with metal lids during science integration, and allow injection of the chemical preservative without opening the unit. After being sealed on August 12, the seeds and seedlings germinated from these seeds in the BRICs were not exposed to light during the launch and the 14-day growth period on the ISS. Therefore, the dichotomous occurrence of the “absence of light” overrepresentation in downregulated and of “response to R/FR light response” in upregulated DEGs is unlikely to be the result of actual differential exposure to light. One likely explanation is related to the hypocotyl-tissue media contact that occurred in our flight samples, which lacked a clear growth vector in microgravity, but had not occurred in our ground samples where roots grew perpendicular into the media. In previous experiments by Johnson et al. (2015) and Paul et al. (2017), the dark-grown ground control plates were oriented vertically and both sample sets displayed petiole elongation, although the precise differences in length or extent of petiole elongation between flight and ground were not quantified. How media contact could induce R/FR light signaling in the dark is not immediately obvious; however, earlier studies showed that media containing sucrose modulated the R/FR signaling mediated by phytochrome A, promoting a red light response (Dijkwel et al., 1997). Coincidentally, the higher rRNA and RNA content observed in flight samples compared with ground control samples in our study (Fig. 2) is also consistent with an increased exposure of cells to sucrose or glucose, which is known to induce RNA accumulation, rRNA transcription, and ribosome biogenesis in plants (Kojima et al., 2007; Ishida et al., 2016), yeast (Kunkel et al., 2019), and mammals (Hannan et al., 2003). Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the remote possibility that our observations may be influenced by possible interactions between ionizing radiation and phytochrome R/FR signaling. For example, low-dose gamma (γ) irradiation of lettuce seeds was found to mimic the effects of FR deactivation of red light-activated phytochromes (Hsiao and Vidaver, 1974). Additionally, a structural study of the bacterial phytochrome from the radiation-resistant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans established that X-ray radiation induced deprotonation of chromophore in the inactive phytochrome, a biochemical step thought to be involved in light-induced activation of this protein (Li et al., 2015). Although the dose required to deprotonate 50% of the phytochrome (Li et al., 2015) was orders of magnitude larger than that expected to be experienced during our experimental period on the ISS, differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytochromes could affect relevant properties of a hypothetical phytochrome–radiation interaction. Interpreting a role for the UPR in the transcriptional response to spaceflight is complicated. We observed clear differences in the number of spaceflight DEGs in the UPR-mutant backgrounds compared with WT (Fig. 4); and only 1118 of the 3465 DEGs were common to all genotypes. This would normally suggest that the transcriptional readjustments that occurred in response to spaceflight were at least partially the result of UPR-dependent processes. However, upon closer analysis of the underlying FPKM values, it became clear that the differences in fold change values (flight/ground) across genotypes were more heavily influenced by the differential regulation of expression in the ground samples by the UPR regulators (Fig. 6). The number of DEGs with FPKM values significantly different from WT FPKM values in at least one UPR-mutant genotype was four times greater in the ground samples compared with flight samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). The heat map visualization of these values (Fig. 6) further suggests that the variations in ground samples expression levels were largely muted by spaceflight, as the endpoint transcript levels in flight samples were nearly uniform in the different genotypes. Overall, this would suggest that the UPR does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight. One explanation for this observation may be related to the concerted downregulation of many stress-responsive processes in the flight samples compared with the ground samples (Fig. 6). In spaceflight conditions, it seems likely that alternative signaling pathways are actuated, which repress the observed stress responses regulated by the UPR. Given the prevalence of starvation responses in ground samples, it is possible that microgravity-induced changes in growth habit provide better nutrient availability (Fig. 7). As such, plants in flight may be able to better handle the stresses imposed by culture conditions, without requiring UPR regulator involvement. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab (A) Hypothesized regulatory framework for stress-responsive DEGs found to be regulated by the UPR on the ground but not in flight conditions. Possible interactions between bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the regulation of DEGs were found in (B) Clusters 2 and 5, (C) Cluster 3, and (D) Cluster 4.Nonetheless, the observations related to an interaction between the UPR regulators bZIP60 and bZIP28 and the stresses imposed on ground control seedlings have yielded important information, which should be explored in the future. In the canonical ER stress response induced chemically or via environmental stress, bZIP60 and bZIP28 TFs interact in the nucleus and direct the actions of the COMPASS DNA methylation complex to increase transcription of target genes (Song et al., 2015). Furthermore, these TFs can also bind independently to gene promoters to activate downstream UPR genes, as evidenced by the weaker activation of ER chaperones in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant compared with either of the bzip28 or bzip60 single mutants (Ruberti et al., 2018; this work). Although it has been suggested that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may also have unique target genes (Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2019), in our ground control samples, the transcriptomic data suggest that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have a more complex antagonistic relationship in the control of genes related to the response to abscisic acid, hypoxia, water deprivation, and to oxidative stress (Fig. 6). In Clusters 2 and 5, and Cluster 4, we observed that the expression levels of the DEGs were higher or lower than WT in the bzip60 genotype, respectively (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S3). However, these differences were not observed in the bzip28 bzip60 double mutant as would be expected. Conversely, in Cluster 3, we observed in ground samples that the expression levels of the DEGs were sharply lower in the bzip28 genotype compared with WT. In the bzip28 bzip60 genotype, the genes in Cluster 3 had expression levels that were higher than the bzip28 genotype but were also lower than those of these genes in the WT or bzip60 genotypes. In response to chemically induced UPR conditions, bZIP60 and bZIP28 cooperatively upregulate several UPR genes (Song et al., 2015; Ruberti et al., 2018). In our ground controls, the stress-responsive genes, largely represented by “response to abscisic acid,” “response to water deprivation,” and “response to hypoxia” abiotic stress responses, were regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60 in a way that suggests that these TFs have antagonistic regulatory effects on these processes (Fig. 7B–D). The exact nature of the stress experienced by the ground control seedlings would need to be elucidated to better understand the impact of this information on agronomic and/or spaceflight applications. Studies on the effect of plant growth in BRIC-PDFUs have already established that significant stress may be imposed on the seedlings grown in these conditions (Johnson et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017). Consistent with our results, other BRIC-PDFU transcriptomes have found a downregulation of genes related to water stress responses (Johnson et al., 2017). However, as evaporative water loss from the BRIC-PDFUs is unlikely because they are sealed containers, the strongly represented GO terms related to “response to water deprivation” and “response to abscisic acid” are unlikely to be a direct response to actual water loss from the plates. Instead, it may be possible that the ground seedlings with etiolated hypocotyls that are not in contact with the media or have less overall contact with the media are water stressed compared with flight seedlings that are in direct contact or have penetrated the media. Independent of the underlying stimulus for the observed differences, the possibility that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have antagonistic interactions related to control of abscisic acid signaling or water deprivation responses should be investigated at the molecular level in the future to improve plant growth and stress responses in space and on the ground.Data Accessibility Raw sequencing data have been deposited at the  Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE148914.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap [1] outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities) [2]. These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible [3], [4]. While the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome [4]. Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome [11], [12], [13], [14]. The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al [15] using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers). Whether confinement can influence the GIT microbiome of long-term inhabitants is an important priority for future space missions [16] and was directly addressed in the longest-running human confined habitat experiment conducted to date, the Mars500 experiment [17]. The Mars500 experiment isolated six astronauts within an analogue Mars-surface habitat. After 520 days, the six astronauts emerged as largely healthy, but the long-term confinement had significantly altered some of their physiology. Research conducted by Strollo et al. [18] measured significant decreases in total body mass (−9.3%), BMI (−5.4%) and lean (non-fat) mass (−11.8%) by day 417 of isolation. When considered alongside significant increases in fasting plasma glucose from a healthy median of 4.65 mmol/L at the beginning of the experiment to prediabetic levels of 6.02 mmol/L (impaired fasting glucose) [19], these findings are indicative of potential disruption in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in astronauts after extensive confinement. This aligned with significant losses of up to 22% of quadriceps/hamstring strength in astronauts, observed by Gaffney et al. [20]. In parallel, Roda et al. [21] observed that the loss of body mass was accompanied by a significant increase in the faecal protein calprotectin, the intestinal inflammation biomarker making up 60% of neutrophils (the cells which characterise intestinal inflammation [22]); from calprotectin negative in astronauts at the beginning of the experiment, towards varying degrees of positive by day 475. Further supporting this general trend towards an onset of intestinal inflammation, Yi et al. [23] directly observed a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils in the Mars500 astronauts after the 520 days of isolation, symptoms which are commonly observed in astronauts during space flight [24]. While Strollo et al. [18] hypothesised that the observed symptoms accompanied by an increase in calprotectin in later faecal samples could be indicative of common metabolic alterations associated with intestinal inflammation, they discounted any microbiome interactions due to prior research conducted by Turroni et al. [17], which did not identify significant microbiome changes over time and found only 14 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, representing putative microbiome species) were shared between the six astronauts. Here, the potential for common microbiome change in the Mars500 astronauts over time is reassessed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology [12] and a common data normalisation strategy for all six astronauts.",

    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview A total of 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were assembled and captured 71.78% of the total 4,837,317 amplicons sequenced, including 213 ESVs present in all six astronauts in the early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) samples alone (Supplementary file 1). Amplicon lengths ranged between 439 and 466 nt. All ESVs were annotated as >99% similar sequence identity: 162 ESVs as putative species (including 14 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 47 ESVs at genera-level, 34 at family-level, while 165 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa) (Fig. 1). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.92% (135 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 67% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.83% identity and captured 7% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.92% identity and captured 11% of counts. ESVs identified from the phylum Firmicutes were the most prevalent, making up 64% of counts, while 7% were from Bacteroidetes, 6% from Actinobacteria, 6% from Verrucomicrobia, 2% from Proteobacteria and 15% were from unknown organisms.

[18], Gaffney et al. [20], Roda et al. [21] and Yi et al. [23]. B) Flower diagram of all 408 ESVs coloured by phyla. The size of the distal node (i.e. lowest taxonomic level for an ESV) is proportional to the total raw abundance. C) the distribution of counts across taxonomy levels, and D) the number of ESVs annotated at each taxonomy level.The ESVs which could be confidently identified as putative species with the highest relative abundance across all astronauts in the phylum Firmicutes were all Clostridia, including Agathobacter_rectalis_1 with 10.1% of total counts, Gemmiger_formicilis_1 with 3.5%, Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 with 3.3%, Fusicatenibacter_saccharivorans_1 with 2.5% and Blautia_wexlerae_1 with 2.1% (Supplementary file 1). In Verrucomicrobia, two distinct ESVs had high relative abundance, Akkermansia_muciniphilia_1 with 3.5% of total counts and Akkermansia_muciniphilia_2 with 2.3% (both having 100% similarity to distinct strain groups, ie. JCM30893 and BSH01), whereas Bacteroides_dorei_1 had the highest relative abundance in the phylum Bacteroidetes with 1.2% of total counts. The ESVs with the highest relative abundance from the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were both ambiguous, with the amplified sequence identical between multiple species (ESVs labelled as _MS), Enterobacterales_MS_1 (sequence common to Brenneria alni, Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Shigella flexneri or Shigella sonnei) and Bifidobacterium_MS_2 (sequence common to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium faecale or Bifidobacterium stercoris). 3.2. Significant microbiome changes identified across astronauts over time To determine whether there were common microbiome changes over time, a simplified experimental design was used to compare the first five samples (7–45 days) and the last five samples (420–520 days) taken from all six astronauts (Fig. 2). When comparing early with late GIT microbiome samples taken from all six astronauts, alpha-diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson) indices were not significantly different in estimated diversity between groups (t-tests p > 0.05). Canonical analysis of principal coordinates suggests samples separated by early and late groups (Fig. 2) and multivariate analysis identified significant variance between the groups (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). To identify which ESVs were significantly altered in relative abundance over time, differential abundance analysis was performed. Thirty-one ESVs were significantly different between timepoints, including 16 significantly enriched and 15 significantly depleted in late samples compared to early samples. 3.2.1. ESVs higher in relative abundance in late astronaut samples The 16 ESVs in significantly higher relative abundance in the astronauts after 420–520 days of confinement were all poorly characterised with the exception of Streptococcus_thermophilus_1 (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Five ESVs have been putatively placed at genera or family levels (Fig. 2): Kineothrix_1, Lachnospiraceae_10, Ruminococcus_3, Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1. The remaining ten differentially abundant ESV are classified here as unknown (<99% similarity to previously identified taxa), although all have previously been observed as unknown bacteria at >99% sequence similarity. Kineothrix_1 and Lachnospiraceae_10 were both most similar to the Kineothrix alysoides strain KNHs209, with 97.50% and 98.41% similar sequence identity, respectively. The ESV Kineothrix_1 did share 100% similarity to a genome assembled from work sequencing difficult to culture (yet-to-be-cultured) microbiome species from the human GIT (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolate 2789STDY5608883) [43]. Ruminococcus_3 is commonly observed at 100% sequence similarity (as an unknown bacteria) in human GIT microbiome studies (for example :AM275462 [44]) and has previously been classified as Ruminococcus sp. strain 95 (unpublished, but most similar to Ruminococcus bromii YE282 genome [45]) although the most similar well-characterised species was the type strain Ruminococcus bromii ATCC 27255 (97.97% similar). Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1, although also commonly observed as unknown bacteria in human faecal samples at 100% sequence similarity, were both highly dissimilar to any known bacterial species (<94% 16S rRNA sequence similarity). The ten unknown sequences identified as significantly differentially abundant and enriched in astronauts after long-term confinement included the three ESVs, Unknown_254, Unknown_268 and Unknown_354, sharing 96–97% similarity to the known species, Anaerocolumna cellulosilytica, Monoglobus pectinilyticus and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, respectively. The seven remaining unknown ESVs had <90% sequence similarity to any known species but have all been previously observed as unknown bacteria (at >99% sequence similarity) in GIT samples of humans as well as other animals [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. Two of these ESVs, Unknown_309 (the highest in relative abundance) and Unknown_49, shared 100% sequence similarity with genomes recently assembled by Almeida et al. [53] in breakthrough research targeting yet-to-be-uncultured species in humans with de novo whole genome shotgun techniques (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolates UMGS1238 and UMGS1543) (Fig. 3). The Unknown_309 sequence has also recently been observed (100% sequence similarity) and classified by Hynönen et al. [54] as the “Ct85 cluster” of uncultured GIT bacteria in mammals (AP10s.319, LR595742.1 Ct85 type-f), alongside other ESVs present in astronauts but which did not significantly vary over time: Unknown_40 (AP07s.345 Ct85 type-d), Unknown_104 (AP07s.302 Ct85 untyped) and Unknown_38 (AP07s.190 Ct85 type-b).

Jukes–Cantor model with neighbour-joining with 10,000 replications and branch support is shown. The scale bar represents 1 substitution in 100 bp. B) Distinct Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ESVs were aligned against sequences from representative strains with genome assemblies. Phylogroup assignment derives from Benevides et al. [55] and Fitzgerald et al. [57].3.2.2. ESVs lower in relative abundance in late astronaut samples After 420–520 days in isolation, 15 ESVs were significantly lower in relative abundance in astronauts. These were better characterised than those enriched over time, including ten ESVs which could be annotated at species level (Fig. 2). These putative species included four distinct Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ESVs (labelled here as Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1, 3, 4 and 5), Ruminococcus_bromii_2, Blautia_luti_2, Anaerostipes_hadrus_1, Roseburia_faecis_1 and Lactobacillus_rogosae_1, as well as the ambiguous ESV Clostridium_MS_1, which shared 100% sequence similarity to both Clostridium disporicum and Clostridium saudiense. Additionally, two EVSs were poorly characterised at genera level, Roseburia_1 and Lachnospira_1, and three were unknown sequences, Unknown_181, Unknown_220 and Unknown_83. Six F. prausnitzii ESVs in total were identified in astronauts, with 4/6 significantly changing in relative abundance, reducing over time in all four cases. All of the ESVs corresponded to known strain groups [55], [56], [57] with 100% similarity (Fig. 3); depleted ESVs were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1 (identical to the type strain F. prausnitzii ATCC27768 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4546; 4573; 4644; M21/2 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_4 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4544; 4542 in phylogroup IIa/subgroup-C) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_5 (identical to F. prausnitzii APC942/32 in phylogroup IIb/outgroup). The two F. prausnitzii ESVs which didn’t significantly vary between confinement time were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_2 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4543; 4574; A2-165 PacBio phylogroup IIb/subgroup-B) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_6 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4575 phylogroup IIb/outgroup). 3.3. A direct comparison between the Mars500 astronaut and habitat microbiome communities To assess the degree to which the astronauts’ microbiomes was associated with their habitat, the surface microbiome of the Mars500 modules, reported by Schwendner et al. [25], was directly compared after reanalysis. A total of 1494 ESVs were assembled from 135 habitat samples, capturing 88.02% of the total 23,417,169 amplicons sequenced (Fig. 4). Amplicon lengths (>0.1% of counts) ranging between 403 and 426 nt. Seven hundred and ninety ESVs could be annotated as putative species (including 341 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 167 ESVs at genera-level, 21 at family-level, while 305 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.95% (790 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 88.39% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.85% identity and captured 3.20% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.88% identity and captured 0.40% of counts.

C) The distribution of counts across taxonomy levels, and D) the number of ESVs annotated at each taxonomy level.The V3-V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the astronaut GIT microbiome, 341F and 805R, was distinct to the V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the Mars500 habitat microbiome, 515F and 926R [17], [25]. To directly compare the astronaut and habitat microbiome datasets, ESVs annotated at species level from each experiment were aligned directly. Alignment of each library revealed 79/162 astronaut ESVs had an identical overlapping V4 hypervariable sequence region (252–253 nts) with one or more of 98/790 habitat ESVs (12.4% of total species), 42 of which were single astronaut-habitat ESV pairs unique to a single species. When gene sequences from genome assemblies were used as scaffolds for astronaut-habitat (gut-environment) ESV pairs, a total of 49 Scaffolded Amplicons (ScAmps) aligned as 100% identical to reference genomes (Fig. 5). Astronaut-habitat ScAmps allowed for improved resolution of distinct 16S rRNA gene sequences and taxonomic annotation. Examples where two distinct taxa could be distinguished using ScAmps but could not from a single primer pair included distinct Anaerostipes hadrus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides caccae and Eggerthella lenta strain groups. The increased length and hypervariable region coverage of ScAmps, between 557 and 590 nt, resolved ESV annotation ambiguity in 8 cases, identifying two distinct Veillonella parvula strain groups (NCTC11810 and UTDB1-3) in the astronaut microbiome, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis in the habitat microbiome, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis in both.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion 4.1. Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview Recent metagenomic studies indicate that the majority of gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome members are still unknown or uncharacterised species [53]. It is therefore not surprising that over half of the ESVs identified across the astronauts were uncharacterised (Fig. 1). This complexity is further complicated as substantial proportions of the human microbiome are often highly unique to individuals. The highly distinct microbiome compositions of each individual astronaut were well described by the initial Mars500 GIT microbiome research conducted by Turroni et al. [17] and make general patterns of microbiome change challenging to observe. The original analysis did, however, report similar phyla present across astronauts, including: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia (although present in all astronauts, bacteria from within this group were originally not detected in two astronauts) and Proteobacteria. Instead of using a distinct normalisation strategy for each astronaut to observe change in steady states [17], [34], here, libraries were pooled from the first five samples and the last five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states (reducing technical noise common to single replicate stool sampling [35], [36], [37]) before all astronauts were compared directly to make statistical analysis of the common change over time more straightforward. 4.2. Enriched taxa in astronauts after long-term confinement The presence of Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (Fig. 2) within the Mars500 habitat is not unexpected as the species is commonly used in the dairy industry and is added to yogurts as live culture to market as bestowing health benefits upon consumption (as a probiotic). Subsequent assessment of astronaut dietary reports during the experiment revealed that the Italian company Granarolo provided lyophilised ‘Yomo’ yogurts to the Mars500 project, which do indeed contain live Streptococcus thermophilus when sold commercially [58]. Interestingly, S. thermophilus is known to be particularly resilient to the freeze-drying process [59], so would likely have been present for consumption as live culture in the habitat. The observed significant increase in relative abundance between early and late confinement times is also coherent as the Italian astronaut reported that the team only ate the lyophilised yogurt in the final 8 months of the experiment (during the simulated “return journey”, reported in a July 2014 interview with astronaut Diego Urbina for the Italian Space Agency’s Outpost 42: Space food in training for Mars). Research suggests that culturing can sometimes capture as low as <1% of a microbial community [60]; however, culture-dependent approaches could have been attempted to confirm viability here. Although bacterial viability was not established, these findings do suggest the introduction of these species to the astronauts has been successfully tracked through to their respective microbiomes. Three ESVs enriched in astronauts after isolation were identified as unknown but shared 97% sequence similarity to well-characterised bacteria A. cellulosilytica, M. pectinilyticus and I. butyriciproducens. A. cellulosilytica and M. pectinilyticus are plant cell wall degrading bacteria with carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) suites allowing degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose [61], and pectin [62], respectively, alongside corresponding fermentation of xylose, arabinose and galacturonic acid. I. butyriciproducens is a butyrate producing species [63] previously identified as increasing in relative abundance alongside a decrease in other common butyrate producers (such a Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) in patients with chronic pain [26]. While changes in bacteria similar to M. pectinilyticus and A. cellulosilytica could be associated with dietary modifications involving fruit or vegetables, alterations to the butyrate producing community could have important implications for GIT homeostasis when considered in the context of increased muscle loss and intestinal inflammation markers over astronaut confinement. Seven ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised species. In complex soil or rhizosphere (plant-soil interface) samples where the majority of microbial species are often yet-to-be-characterised [64], [65], difficult to culture groups of bacteria such as the TM7 (group 1) bacteria have previously been observed as differentially abundant [28]. In humans, uncharacterised species often share the most sequence similarity to the TM7 (group 3) bacteria, which are typified by recalcitrance to standard culturing techniques [66] currently thought to stem from their epibiont lifestyle (living on the surface of other microbes) [67]. However, the ubiquitous presence of unknown or poorly characterised microbes in human GIT samples is often not reported, hindering their study. The scale of uncharacterised human microbiome members was recently well-captured by Almeida et al. [53] using de novo whole genome shotgun metagenomics to assemble 1952 uncultured candidate bacterial species genomes from 11,850 human GIT microbiome samples, some of which shared 100% sequence identity with ESVs observed here (Fig. 3). While reporting unknown or poorly characterised organisms can be challenging, these ESVs are significantly associated with long-term isolation in astronauts. Although little is known as to the role that these microbes might play in health, they do also seem to be consistently present in humans and are here implicated as dynamic members of the human microbiome meriting further study as potentially having novel biological importance. 4.3. Depleted taxa in astronauts after long-term confinement Although the microbiome species enriched after long-term confinement were largely uncharacterised organisms, the majority of the significantly depleted species were well known. F. prausnitzii is one of the best characterised inhabitants of a healthy human GIT and is a butyrate producer with well-documented anti-inflammatory properties whose reduction in relative abundance is consistently associated with intestinal inflammation [68], [69] and an increase in calprotectin [70], [71]. F. prausnitzii also almost always negatively associates with type 2 diabetes (4/5 controlled studies) [72], implicating a putative role in insulin resistance. The significant reduction in F. prausnitzii in astronauts after long-term confinement (Figs. 2 and 3) is therefore consistent with the intestinal inflammation, increased faecal calprotectin levels, moderate insulin resistance and lean body mass loss reported by Roda et al. [21], Yi et al. [23], Strollo et al. [18] and Gaffney et al. [20] in Mars500 astronauts over the 520 days of confinement. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii phylogroup II is considered to be the less sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation when depleted [57], [73]. This aligns to the pattern of depletion in only four putative strain-types observed here, as the two out of six F. prausnitzii ESVs which were not significantly depleted over time shared 100% similarity to members of phylogroup IIb [55], [56], [57]. Turroni et al. [17] reported a decreasing trend in OTUs associated to F. prausnitzii over time when first assessing the Mars500 astronaut microbiomes, but were limited in capability to statistically compare OTUs across astronauts owing to tailoring normalisation to each astronaut as well as because low taxonomic resolution would conflate the distinct patterns of relative abundance in these F. prausnitzii ESVs. The five other putative species identified as significantly depleted in relative abundance after long-term confinement, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae (Fig. 2), were each consistent with this association with intestinal inflammation and disruption of glucose metabolism. The Ruminococcus bromii ESV was only 99.10% similar to the type strain, Ruminococcus bromii strain ATCC 27255, but was 100% similar to the strain L2-36 (:GCA_002834165.1) (Fig. 3) which is considered a ‘keystone’ degrader of resistant starch in the human GIT [74], [75]. Robinson et al. [76], [77] first reported a direct relationship between dietary resistant starch and insulin sensitivity improvement but could not explain the association through investigation of host metabolism alone. Although a study in germ-free mice has suggested the impact of resistant starch on insulin resistance could be independent of intestinal bacteria [78], members of the GIT microbiome have largely been considered to underlie the relationship [79], [80], [81]. R. bromii has been more directly associated to insulin resistance through increased relative abundance, alongside F. prausnitzii, in patients with metabolic syndrome after faecal matter transplant from healthy donors which improved insulin sensitivity [82]. Similarly, Benitez-paez et al. [83] recently reported decreases in the relative abundance of B. luti (reclassified from Ruminococcus luti) associated with insulin resistance of obese children, alongside significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines similar to those observed by Yi et al. [23] in Mars500 astronauts after 520 days isolation. Benitez-paez et al. [83] also demonstrated B. luti had anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro cell cultures and speculated that a reduction of B. luti within the GIT may contribute to insulin resistance through increase intestinal inflammation. Both A. hadrus and R. faecis are butyrate producers with the former associated to insulin metabolism, significantly increasing in relative abundance (3-fold) in patients responding to FMT treatment with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased proinflammatory markers [84], and the latter whose reduction has been associated to increased inflammation alongside F. prausnitzii [85]. The L. rogosae ESV shares 100% sequence identity to the type-strain L. rogosae strain ATCC 27753. Although less well-studied and potentially misplaced taxonomically [86], L. rogosae was found to be significantly reduced in relative abundance in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (alongside R. faecis and Faecalibacteria sp.) [87] and in MRSA positive patients with increased serum inflammatory markers (alongside F. prausnitzii) [88] when compared to healthy controls in both cases. Despite the highly unique nature of each astronaut’s microbiome, these findings indicate common changes in specific microbiome species over the 520 days of isolation which are consistent with the reported common significant increases in proinflammatory markers and losses in strength and lean body mass. While the potential involvement of these observed microbiome species is discussed (alongside appropriate evidence), no causal relationship between their relative abundance and astronaut health is established in this work. 4.4. Commonalities between the Mars500 astronaut and habitat microbiome communities Enrichment of in-built environments with human-associated bacteria is thought to occur rapidly [89] and surface microbiome research conducted in hospital environments (intensive care units and operating theatres), clean rooms and the international space station (ISS) revealed that the selective pressure of confinement and cleaning procedures can promote acquisition of broad resistance mechanisms in a microbial community adapted to human habitation [11], [90]. Other studies into the environmental microbiome of MIR [91] and the ISS [14], [92], [93], [94] have also revealed enrichment of human-associated microbes, in particular within compartments with the highest human inhabitancy (such as the crew quarters [12]). This phenomenon was also reported in the Mars500 confinement experiment, where the environmental microbiome was explored in samples taken from the habitation, utility and medical modules throughout the course of the 520-day experiment. Schwendner et al. [25] reported that the only bacteria detected in all three Mars500 modules were some of the most common human microbiome species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis. The potential for opportunistic pathogen selection is of particular concern for long-duration space travel where astronaut health is at risk and medical facilities are limited. Comparisons of 16S rRNA gene OTUs (97% clustered) have previously been performed comparing faecal matter and local water samples to investigate environmental contamination in Kenya [95] using SourceTracker [96]. Improved 16S rRNA gene bioinformatics approaches (ANCHOR [12], UPARSE [97], DADA2 [98] or QIIME2 [99]) are able to discern amplicon sequences with more confidence in complex metagenomic samples (Fig. 4), allowing for sequences to be compared directly between experiments (Fig. 5). Different primer pairs can have variable 16s rRNA gene amplification rates for different bacteria, potentially confounding direct quantitative integration of amplicon counts across two primer pairs; however, the Mars500 experiment, specifically the high quality datasets shared by Turroni et al. [17] and Schwendner et al. [25], provided a one-off opportunity for qualitative comparison of the microbiota commonality between a closed system environment and the gut of its entire inhabiting population over 520 days as both of these primer pairs have over 95% coverage of known bacterial species [100]. Direct sequence comparison indicated that 49% and 12% of species were shared between the Mars500 astronaut GIT and environmental habitat microbiomes, respectively, suggesting extensive interactions between the communities.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Significant changes in the relative abundance of astronaut microbiome species occurred over the 520 days of isolation. Some enrichment of known bacteria corresponded to changes in the crew’s diet, although significant enrichment of unknown species highlights the ongoing challenge faced in understanding how complex microbiome interactions influence human health. Depletion of major anti-inflammatory gastrointestinal tract bacteria over time is consistent with symptoms associated with the intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance measured during the Mars500 experiment and sometimes observed in astronauts during long-duration space flight. Sequence comparison of the astronauts’ faecal microbiome to the Mars500 environmental microbiome revealed direct large-scale associations between the gut and environmental microbiomes, an observation made possible due to the extreme experimental confinement. Identification of significant species-level microbiome alterations which align with astronaut symptoms connects the Russian, European, Chinese and now Canadian Space Agency Mars500 studies. This initial evidence of a potentially deleterious impact of long-term confinement upon microbiome health is an important step forward in the current drive to enable long-duration spaceflight.",

The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight.1. Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap [1] outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030. Safeguarding astronaut health is a critical factor in meeting this ambitious target. The Canadian Space Agency currently considers the major human health risk categories associated to space flight as: musculoskeletal (reduced muscle strength, aerobic capacity and bone fragility), sensorimotor (visual impairment), metabolic (nutritional status and sickness), behavioural health and performance (stress, fatigue, cognitive deterioration and wellbeing), radiation (ultraviolet and ionising), autonomous medical care (medical access), and physiological adaptation to variable gravity and environmental stressors (including human-associated microbial communities) [2]. These challenges are magnified in long-duration space flight, such as during a two–three year mission to Mars, where no resupply of air, water, food or medical supplies is possible, radiation and microgravity exposure will be for longer than has yet been tested, and abortion of a mission due to crew illness will not be possible [3], [4]. While the human gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome is still being explored, it is considered essential for long-term maintenance of many aspects of human health, including healthy nutritional, immune, metabolic and psychophysiological function [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Long-duration habitat confinement, such as that faced by astronauts during spaceflight, could interrupt the dialog between environmental microbial ecosystems and the human microbiome [4]. Previous research has established that confined habitats subject to strict cleaning procedures on Earth, such as intensive care units and surgical theatres, as well as those in space, can produce a unique surface environment dominated by human GIT microbiome [11], [12], [13], [14]. The influence of confinement upon the microbiome has been studied recently in four astronauts over 60 days by Chen et al [15] using bioregenerative life support systems (confined and self-sufficient ecosystems). Although no common microbiome composition was observed over time they did report a potential non-significant trend of depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as well as large individual differences between individuals (expected in microbiome studies with very low participant numbers). Whether confinement can influence the GIT microbiome of long-term inhabitants is an important priority for future space missions [16] and was directly addressed in the longest-running human confined habitat experiment conducted to date, the Mars500 experiment [17]. The Mars500 experiment isolated six astronauts within an analogue Mars-surface habitat. After 520 days, the six astronauts emerged as largely healthy, but the long-term confinement had significantly altered some of their physiology. Research conducted by Strollo et al. [18] measured significant decreases in total body mass (−9.3%), BMI (−5.4%) and lean (non-fat) mass (−11.8%) by day 417 of isolation. When considered alongside significant increases in fasting plasma glucose from a healthy median of 4.65 mmol/L at the beginning of the experiment to prediabetic levels of 6.02 mmol/L (impaired fasting glucose) [19], these findings are indicative of potential disruption in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in astronauts after extensive confinement. This aligned with significant losses of up to 22% of quadriceps/hamstring strength in astronauts, observed by Gaffney et al. [20]. In parallel, Roda et al. [21] observed that the loss of body mass was accompanied by a significant increase in the faecal protein calprotectin, the intestinal inflammation biomarker making up 60% of neutrophils (the cells which characterise intestinal inflammation [22]); from calprotectin negative in astronauts at the beginning of the experiment, towards varying degrees of positive by day 475. Further supporting this general trend towards an onset of intestinal inflammation, Yi et al. [23] directly observed a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophils in the Mars500 astronauts after the 520 days of isolation, symptoms which are commonly observed in astronauts during space flight [24]. While Strollo et al. [18] hypothesised that the observed symptoms accompanied by an increase in calprotectin in later faecal samples could be indicative of common metabolic alterations associated with intestinal inflammation, they discounted any microbiome interactions due to prior research conducted by Turroni et al. [17], which did not identify significant microbiome changes over time and found only 14 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, representing putative microbiome species) were shared between the six astronauts. Here, the potential for common microbiome change in the Mars500 astronauts over time is reassessed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology [12] and a common data normalisation strategy for all six astronauts.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample collection and microbiome sequencing The Mars500 experiment was a ground-based human isolation study conducted over 520 days which aimed to simulate a manned mission to Mars [17], [20], [25]. The study participants were all male and their ages ranged from 29 to 40. Faecal samples used for analysis here were taken on the days 7, 14, 21, 30 and 45 (early) and days 420, 450, 490, 504, 520 of the Mars500 experiment (Supplementary file 1). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in [17]. Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from faeces using a modified bead-beating and column extraction with QIAamp DNA Stool miniKit. Amplification used 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) primers targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences available in  SRA BioProject PRJNA358005 or from https://genelab.nasa.gov/. Mars500 habitat environmental samples used for analysis were taken from surfaces using swabs on the days 14, 44, 436, 467, 496 to correspond to faecal microbiome sampling and were from the utility, medical or habitat modules (Supplementary file 1). Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing approaches were not conducted in this study but are reported in [25]. Briefly, the authors report that total DNA was isolated from surfaces using a 552C regular ethylene oxide sterilized swab moistened with PCR grade H2O. Total DNA was extracted using a FastDNA SPIN Kit. Amplification used 515f (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 926r (5′-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT-3′) primers targeting the V4 hypervariable region and amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp paired-end). Raw sequences were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive accession number: PRJEB21072.2.2. Data processing Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor [12], [26], [27], [28]. The amplicon terminology of exact sequence variants (ESV) are used in place of operational taxonomic unit as no 97% similarity clustering is used [29], [30], [31], [32]. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur [33] and an ESV count threshold of 18 for the astronaut faecal microbiome dataset and 30 for the Mars500 habitat dataset. Annotation at family, genera or species-level used BLASTn criteria of BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the  curated bacterial and Archaea RefSeq and  nr/nt databases (January 2020 versions). All annotation calls are putative despite >99% similarity, as databases are subject to change as discoveries are made and phylogenies revised. Reporting of 100% similar sequence matches to unique species is more accurate than reporting such hits at higher taxon levels [12]; however, all annotation should be considered as putative and interpreted with care. Differentially abundant ESVs annotated from the  nr/nt database were manually assessed for quality. Annotation improvement is possible as databases improve/expand using the sequences provided with each ESV in Supplementary file 1. When the highest identity/coverage is shared amongst multiple different putative annotation, all annotation is retained and reported. Amplicons with low-counts (<30 or <18) are binned to high-count sequences in a second BLASTn, using a lower threshold of >98% identity/coverage.2.3. Statistical analysis The normalisation strategy conducted by Turroni et al. [17] was distinct for each astronaut to allow observation of individual microbiome change in steady states [34] over time. While this described some unique elements of each astronaut, the strategy made observation of common OTUs challenging. Here, while the limited biological replication of 6n (astronauts) could not be altered, the variation introduced from single replicate stool sampling [35], [36], [37] could be reduced by pooling libraries from the first five samples and from the final five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states of the each astronaut. Samples selected to represent early and late periods of confinement were defined as the first and last set of five samples taken from all six astronauts and the libraries were pooled in silico per astronaut and period. These timepoints also represent the samples available for all six astronauts which best aligned with the Mars500 physiology studies measuring astronaut body mass [18], strength [20], faecal protein calprotectin [21] and immune responses [23]. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2 [38], [39], which performs well with 16S rRNA gene amplicon data and uneven library sizes [40]. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) < 0.1 was applied [41]. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample is <90% of the count in all samples and ESV counts must be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group (early or late) [12]. Constrained ordination analysis was performed using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP; Fig. 2) with the 1-dimensional constraint (early vs late) represented on the x-axis and the first axis of non-constrained ordination (multidimensional scaling) on the y-axis. This analysis was performed with the Vegan library [42] on R via the capscale function. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Early and late microbiome of Mars500 astronauts.

Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview A total of 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were assembled and captured 71.78% of the total 4,837,317 amplicons sequenced, including 213 ESVs present in all six astronauts in the early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) samples alone (Supplementary file 1). Amplicon lengths ranged between 439 and 466 nt. All ESVs were annotated as >99% similar sequence identity: 162 ESVs as putative species (including 14 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 47 ESVs at genera-level, 34 at family-level, while 165 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa) (Fig. 1). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.92% (135 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 67% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.83% identity and captured 7% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.92% identity and captured 11% of counts. ESVs identified from the phylum Firmicutes were the most prevalent, making up 64% of counts, while 7% were from Bacteroidetes, 6% from Actinobacteria, 6% from Verrucomicrobia, 2% from Proteobacteria and 15% were from unknown organisms.

C) the distribution of counts across taxonomy levels, and D) the number of ESVs annotated at each taxonomy level.The ESVs which could be confidently identified as putative species with the highest relative abundance across all astronauts in the phylum Firmicutes were all Clostridia, including Agathobacter_rectalis_1 with 10.1% of total counts, Gemmiger_formicilis_1 with 3.5%, Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 with 3.3%, Fusicatenibacter_saccharivorans_1 with 2.5% and Blautia_wexlerae_1 with 2.1% (Supplementary file 1). In Verrucomicrobia, two distinct ESVs had high relative abundance, Akkermansia_muciniphilia_1 with 3.5% of total counts and Akkermansia_muciniphilia_2 with 2.3% (both having 100% similarity to distinct strain groups, ie. JCM30893 and BSH01), whereas Bacteroides_dorei_1 had the highest relative abundance in the phylum Bacteroidetes with 1.2% of total counts. The ESVs with the highest relative abundance from the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were both ambiguous, with the amplified sequence identical between multiple species (ESVs labelled as _MS), Enterobacterales_MS_1 (sequence common to Brenneria alni, Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Shigella flexneri or Shigella sonnei) and Bifidobacterium_MS_2 (sequence common to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium faecale or Bifidobacterium stercoris).3.2. Significant microbiome changes identified across astronauts over time To determine whether there were common microbiome changes over time, a simplified experimental design was used to compare the first five samples (7–45 days) and the last five samples (420–520 days) taken from all six astronauts (Fig. 2). When comparing early with late GIT microbiome samples taken from all six astronauts, alpha-diversity (Shannon and inverse Simpson) indices were not significantly different in estimated diversity between groups (t-tests p > 0.05). Canonical analysis of principal coordinates suggests samples separated by early and late groups (Fig. 2) and multivariate analysis identified significant variance between the groups (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). To identify which ESVs were significantly altered in relative abundance over time, differential abundance analysis was performed. Thirty-one ESVs were significantly different between timepoints, including 16 significantly enriched and 15 significantly depleted in late samples compared to early samples. 3.2.1. ESVs higher in relative abundance in late astronaut samples The 16 ESVs in significantly higher relative abundance in the astronauts after 420–520 days of confinement were all poorly characterised with the exception of Streptococcus_thermophilus_1 (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). Five ESVs have been putatively placed at genera or family levels (Fig. 2): Kineothrix_1, Lachnospiraceae_10, Ruminococcus_3, Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1. The remaining ten differentially abundant ESV are classified here as unknown (<99% similarity to previously identified taxa), although all have previously been observed as unknown bacteria at >99% sequence similarity. Kineothrix_1 and Lachnospiraceae_10 were both most similar to the Kineothrix alysoides strain KNHs209, with 97.50% and 98.41% similar sequence identity, respectively. The ESV Kineothrix_1 did share 100% similarity to a genome assembled from work sequencing difficult to culture (yet-to-be-cultured) microbiome species from the human GIT (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolate 2789STDY5608883) [43]. Ruminococcus_3 is commonly observed at 100% sequence similarity (as an unknown bacteria) in human GIT microbiome studies (for example :AM275462 [44]) and has previously been classified as Ruminococcus sp. strain 95 (unpublished, but most similar to Ruminococcus bromii YE282 genome [45]) although the most similar well-characterised species was the type strain Ruminococcus bromii ATCC 27255 (97.97% similar). Ruminococcaceae_1 and Christensenellaceae_1, although also commonly observed as unknown bacteria in human faecal samples at 100% sequence similarity, were both highly dissimilar to any known bacterial species (<94% 16S rRNA sequence similarity). The ten unknown sequences identified as significantly differentially abundant and enriched in astronauts after long-term confinement included the three ESVs, Unknown_254, Unknown_268 and Unknown_354, sharing 96–97% similarity to the known species, Anaerocolumna cellulosilytica, Monoglobus pectinilyticus and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, respectively. The seven remaining unknown ESVs had <90% sequence similarity to any known species but have all been previously observed as unknown bacteria (at >99% sequence similarity) in GIT samples of humans as well as other animals [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]. Two of these ESVs, Unknown_309 (the highest in relative abundance) and Unknown_49, shared 100% sequence similarity with genomes recently assembled by Almeida et al. [53] in breakthrough research targeting yet-to-be-uncultured species in humans with de novo whole genome shotgun techniques (uncultured Clostridium sp. isolates UMGS1238 and UMGS1543) (Fig. 3). The Unknown_309 sequence has also recently been observed (100% sequence similarity) and classified by Hynönen et al. [54] as the “Ct85 cluster” of uncultured GIT bacteria in mammals (AP10s.319, LR595742.1 Ct85 type-f), alongside other ESVs present in astronauts but which did not significantly vary over time: Unknown_40 (AP07s.345 Ct85 type-d), Unknown_104 (AP07s.302 Ct85 untyped) and Unknown_38 (AP07s.190 Ct85 type-b).

B) Distinct Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ESVs were aligned against sequences from representative strains with genome assemblies. Phylogroup assignment derives from Benevides et al. [55] and Fitzgerald et al. [57].3.2.2. ESVs lower in relative abundance in late astronaut samples After 420–520 days in isolation, 15 ESVs were significantly lower in relative abundance in astronauts. These were better characterised than those enriched over time, including ten ESVs which could be annotated at species level (Fig. 2). These putative species included four distinct Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ESVs (labelled here as Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1, 3, 4 and 5), Ruminococcus_bromii_2, Blautia_luti_2, Anaerostipes_hadrus_1, Roseburia_faecis_1 and Lactobacillus_rogosae_1, as well as the ambiguous ESV Clostridium_MS_1, which shared 100% sequence similarity to both Clostridium disporicum and Clostridium saudiense. Additionally, two EVSs were poorly characterised at genera level, Roseburia_1 and Lachnospira_1, and three were unknown sequences, Unknown_181, Unknown_220 and Unknown_83. Six F. prausnitzii ESVs in total were identified in astronauts, with 4/6 significantly changing in relative abundance, reducing over time in all four cases. All of the ESVs corresponded to known strain groups [55], [56], [57] with 100% similarity (Fig. 3); depleted ESVs were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_1 (identical to the type strain F. prausnitzii ATCC27768 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_3 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4546; 4573; 4644; M21/2 in phylogroup I/subgroup-A), Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_4 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4544; 4542 in phylogroup IIa/subgroup-C) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_5 (identical to F. prausnitzii APC942/32 in phylogroup IIb/outgroup). The two F. prausnitzii ESVs which didn’t significantly vary between confinement time were Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_2 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4543; 4574; A2-165 PacBio phylogroup IIb/subgroup-B) and Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_6 (identical to F. prausnitzii CNCM 4575 phylogroup IIb/outgroup).3.3. A direct comparison between the Mars500 astronaut and habitat microbiome communities To assess the degree to which the astronauts’ microbiomes was associated with their habitat, the surface microbiome of the Mars500 modules, reported by Schwendner et al. [25], was directly compared after reanalysis. A total of 1494 ESVs were assembled from 135 habitat samples, capturing 88.02% of the total 23,417,169 amplicons sequenced (Fig. 4). Amplicon lengths (>0.1% of counts) ranging between 403 and 426 nt. Seven hundred and ninety ESVs could be annotated as putative species (including 341 which were ambiguous sequences to multiple species), 167 ESVs at genera-level, 21 at family-level, while 305 were poorly classified or unknown (<99% similarity to any well-characterised taxa). ESVs which could be annotated at species-level had an average identity of 99.95% (790 ESVs had 100% sequence similarity) and captured 88.39% of counts, those annotated at genera-level averaged 99.85% identity and captured 3.20% of counts, whereas those annotated at family-level averaged 99.88% identity and captured 0.40% of counts.

B) Flower diagram of all 1494 Mars500 habitat environment ESVs coloured by phyla (and Plantae). The size of the distal node (i.e. lowest taxonomic level for an ESV) is proportional to the total raw abundance. C) The distribution of counts across taxonomy levels, and D) the number of ESVs annotated at each taxonomy level.The V3-V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the astronaut GIT microbiome, 341F and 805R, was distinct to the V4 16S rRNA gene primer pair used to assess the Mars500 habitat microbiome, 515F and 926R [17], [25]. To directly compare the astronaut and habitat microbiome datasets, ESVs annotated at species level from each experiment were aligned directly. Alignment of each library revealed 79/162 astronaut ESVs had an identical overlapping V4 hypervariable sequence region (252–253 nts) with one or more of 98/790 habitat ESVs (12.4% of total species), 42 of which were single astronaut-habitat ESV pairs unique to a single species. When gene sequences from genome assemblies were used as scaffolds for astronaut-habitat (gut-environment) ESV pairs, a total of 49 Scaffolded Amplicons (ScAmps) aligned as 100% identical to reference genomes (Fig. 5). Astronaut-habitat ScAmps allowed for improved resolution of distinct 16S rRNA gene sequences and taxonomic annotation. Examples where two distinct taxa could be distinguished using ScAmps but could not from a single primer pair included distinct Anaerostipes hadrus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides caccae and Eggerthella lenta strain groups. The increased length and hypervariable region coverage of ScAmps, between 557 and 590 nt, resolved ESV annotation ambiguity in 8 cases, identifying two distinct Veillonella parvula strain groups (NCTC11810 and UTDB1-3) in the astronaut microbiome, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis in the habitat microbiome, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis in both.

Discussion 4.1. Mars500 astronaut gastrointestinal track microbiome community overview Recent metagenomic studies indicate that the majority of gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome members are still unknown or uncharacterised species [53]. It is therefore not surprising that over half of the ESVs identified across the astronauts were uncharacterised (Fig. 1). This complexity is further complicated as substantial proportions of the human microbiome are often highly unique to individuals. The highly distinct microbiome compositions of each individual astronaut were well described by the initial Mars500 GIT microbiome research conducted by Turroni et al. [17] and make general patterns of microbiome change challenging to observe. The original analysis did, however, report similar phyla present across astronauts, including: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia (although present in all astronauts, bacteria from within this group were originally not detected in two astronauts) and Proteobacteria. Instead of using a distinct normalisation strategy for each astronaut to observe change in steady states [17], [34], here, libraries were pooled from the first five samples and the last five samples to improve representation of early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) microbiome states (reducing technical noise common to single replicate stool sampling [35], [36], [37]) before all astronauts were compared directly to make statistical analysis of the common change over time more straightforward.4.2. Enriched taxa in astronauts after long-term confinement The presence of Streptococcus thermophilus (Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (Fig. 2) within the Mars500 habitat is not unexpected as the species is commonly used in the dairy industry and is added to yogurts as live culture to market as bestowing health benefits upon consumption (as a probiotic). Subsequent assessment of astronaut dietary reports during the experiment revealed that the Italian company Granarolo provided lyophilised ‘Yomo’ yogurts to the Mars500 project, which do indeed contain live Streptococcus thermophilus when sold commercially [58]. Interestingly, S. thermophilus is known to be particularly resilient to the freeze-drying process [59], so would likely have been present for consumption as live culture in the habitat. The observed significant increase in relative abundance between early and late confinement times is also coherent as the Italian astronaut reported that the team only ate the lyophilised yogurt in the final 8 months of the experiment (during the simulated “return journey”, reported in a July 2014 interview with astronaut Diego Urbina for the Italian Space Agency’s Outpost 42: Space food in training for Mars). Research suggests that culturing can sometimes capture as low as <1% of a microbial community [60]; however, culture-dependent approaches could have been attempted to confirm viability here. Although bacterial viability was not established, these findings do suggest the introduction of these species to the astronauts has been successfully tracked through to their respective microbiomes. Three ESVs enriched in astronauts after isolation were identified as unknown but shared 97% sequence similarity to well-characterised bacteria A. cellulosilytica, M. pectinilyticus and I. butyriciproducens. A. cellulosilytica and M. pectinilyticus are plant cell wall degrading bacteria with carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) suites allowing degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose [61], and pectin [62], respectively, alongside corresponding fermentation of xylose, arabinose and galacturonic acid. I. butyriciproducens is a butyrate producing species [63] previously identified as increasing in relative abundance alongside a decrease in other common butyrate producers (such a Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) in patients with chronic pain [26]. While changes in bacteria similar to M. pectinilyticus and A. cellulosilytica could be associated with dietary modifications involving fruit or vegetables, alterations to the butyrate producing community could have important implications for GIT homeostasis when considered in the context of increased muscle loss and intestinal inflammation markers over astronaut confinement. Seven ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised species. In complex soil or rhizosphere (plant-soil interface) samples where the majority of microbial species are often yet-to-be-characterised [64], [65], difficult to culture groups of bacteria such as the TM7 (group 1) bacteria have previously been observed as differentially abundant [28]. In humans, uncharacterised species often share the most sequence similarity to the TM7 (group 3) bacteria, which are typified by recalcitrance to standard culturing techniques [66] currently thought to stem from their epibiont lifestyle (living on the surface of other microbes) [67]. However, the ubiquitous presence of unknown or poorly characterised microbes in human GIT samples is often not reported, hindering their study. The scale of uncharacterised human microbiome members was recently well-captured by Almeida et al. [53] using de novo whole genome shotgun metagenomics to assemble 1952 uncultured candidate bacterial species genomes from 11,850 human GIT microbiome samples, some of which shared 100% sequence identity with ESVs observed here (Fig. 3). While reporting unknown or poorly characterised organisms can be challenging, these ESVs are significantly associated with long-term isolation in astronauts. Although little is known as to the role that these microbes might play in health, they do also seem to be consistently present in humans and are here implicated as dynamic members of the human microbiome meriting further study as potentially having novel biological importance.4.3. Depleted taxa in astronauts after long-term confinement Although the microbiome species enriched after long-term confinement were largely uncharacterised organisms, the majority of the significantly depleted species were well known. F. prausnitzii is one of the best characterised inhabitants of a healthy human GIT and is a butyrate producer with well-documented anti-inflammatory properties whose reduction in relative abundance is consistently associated with intestinal inflammation [68], [69] and an increase in calprotectin [70], [71]. F. prausnitzii also almost always negatively associates with type 2 diabetes (4/5 controlled studies) [72], implicating a putative role in insulin resistance. The significant reduction in F. prausnitzii in astronauts after long-term confinement (Figs. 2 and 3) is therefore consistent with the intestinal inflammation, increased faecal calprotectin levels, moderate insulin resistance and lean body mass loss reported by Roda et al. [21], Yi et al. [23], Strollo et al. [18] and Gaffney et al. [20] in Mars500 astronauts over the 520 days of confinement. Interestingly, F. prausnitzii phylogroup II is considered to be the less sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation when depleted [57], [73]. This aligns to the pattern of depletion in only four putative strain-types observed here, as the two out of six F. prausnitzii ESVs which were not significantly depleted over time shared 100% similarity to members of phylogroup IIb [55], [56], [57]. Turroni et al. [17] reported a decreasing trend in OTUs associated to F. prausnitzii over time when first assessing the Mars500 astronaut microbiomes, but were limited in capability to statistically compare OTUs across astronauts owing to tailoring normalisation to each astronaut as well as because low taxonomic resolution would conflate the distinct patterns of relative abundance in these F. prausnitzii ESVs. The five other putative species identified as significantly depleted in relative abundance after long-term confinement, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae (Fig. 2), were each consistent with this association with intestinal inflammation and disruption of glucose metabolism. The Ruminococcus bromii ESV was only 99.10% similar to the type strain, Ruminococcus bromii strain ATCC 27255, but was 100% similar to the strain L2-36 (:GCA_002834165.1) (Fig. 3) which is considered a ‘keystone’ degrader of resistant starch in the human GIT [74], [75]. Robinson et al. [76], [77] first reported a direct relationship between dietary resistant starch and insulin sensitivity improvement but could not explain the association through investigation of host metabolism alone. Although a study in germ-free mice has suggested the impact of resistant starch on insulin resistance could be independent of intestinal bacteria [78], members of the GIT microbiome have largely been considered to underlie the relationship [79], [80], [81]. R. bromii has been more directly associated to insulin resistance through increased relative abundance, alongside F. prausnitzii, in patients with metabolic syndrome after faecal matter transplant from healthy donors which improved insulin sensitivity [82]. Similarly, Benitez-paez et al. [83] recently reported decreases in the relative abundance of B. luti (reclassified from Ruminococcus luti) associated with insulin resistance of obese children, alongside significant increases in proinflammatory cytokines similar to those observed by Yi et al. [23] in Mars500 astronauts after 520 days isolation. Benitez-paez et al. [83] also demonstrated B. luti had anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro cell cultures and speculated that a reduction of B. luti within the GIT may contribute to insulin resistance through increase intestinal inflammation. Both A. hadrus and R. faecis are butyrate producers with the former associated to insulin metabolism, significantly increasing in relative abundance (3-fold) in patients responding to FMT treatment with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased proinflammatory markers [84], and the latter whose reduction has been associated to increased inflammation alongside F. prausnitzii [85]. The L. rogosae ESV shares 100% sequence identity to the type-strain L. rogosae strain ATCC 27753. Although less well-studied and potentially misplaced taxonomically [86], L. rogosae was found to be significantly reduced in relative abundance in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (alongside R. faecis and Faecalibacteria sp.) [87] and in MRSA positive patients with increased serum inflammatory markers (alongside F. prausnitzii) [88] when compared to healthy controls in both cases. Despite the highly unique nature of each astronaut’s microbiome, these findings indicate common changes in specific microbiome species over the 520 days of isolation which are consistent with the reported common significant increases in proinflammatory markers and losses in strength and lean body mass. While the potential involvement of these observed microbiome species is discussed (alongside appropriate evidence), no causal relationship between their relative abundance and astronaut health is established in this work.4.4. Commonalities between the Mars500 astronaut and habitat microbiome communities Enrichment of in-built environments with human-associated bacteria is thought to occur rapidly [89] and surface microbiome research conducted in hospital environments (intensive care units and operating theatres), clean rooms and the international space station (ISS) revealed that the selective pressure of confinement and cleaning procedures can promote acquisition of broad resistance mechanisms in a microbial community adapted to human habitation [11], [90]. Other studies into the environmental microbiome of MIR [91] and the ISS [14], [92], [93], [94] have also revealed enrichment of human-associated microbes, in particular within compartments with the highest human inhabitancy (such as the crew quarters [12]). This phenomenon was also reported in the Mars500 confinement experiment, where the environmental microbiome was explored in samples taken from the habitation, utility and medical modules throughout the course of the 520-day experiment. Schwendner et al. [25] reported that the only bacteria detected in all three Mars500 modules were some of the most common human microbiome species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis. The potential for opportunistic pathogen selection is of particular concern for long-duration space travel where astronaut health is at risk and medical facilities are limited. Comparisons of 16S rRNA gene OTUs (97% clustered) have previously been performed comparing faecal matter and local water samples to investigate environmental contamination in Kenya [95] using SourceTracker [96]. Improved 16S rRNA gene bioinformatics approaches (ANCHOR [12], UPARSE [97], DADA2 [98] or QIIME2 [99]) are able to discern amplicon sequences with more confidence in complex metagenomic samples (Fig. 4), allowing for sequences to be compared directly between experiments (Fig. 5). Different primer pairs can have variable 16s rRNA gene amplification rates for different bacteria, potentially confounding direct quantitative integration of amplicon counts across two primer pairs; however, the Mars500 experiment, specifically the high quality datasets shared by Turroni et al. [17] and Schwendner et al. [25], provided a one-off opportunity for qualitative comparison of the microbiota commonality between a closed system environment and the gut of its entire inhabiting population over 520 days as both of these primer pairs have over 95% coverage of known bacterial species [100]. Direct sequence comparison indicated that 49% and 12% of species were shared between the Mars500 astronaut GIT and environmental habitat microbiomes, respectively, suggesting extensive interactions between the communities.5. Conclusions Significant changes in the relative abundance of astronaut microbiome species occurred over the 520 days of isolation. Some enrichment of known bacteria corresponded to changes in the crew’s diet, although significant enrichment of unknown species highlights the ongoing challenge faced in understanding how complex microbiome interactions influence human health. Depletion of major anti-inflammatory gastrointestinal tract bacteria over time is consistent with symptoms associated with the intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance measured during the Mars500 experiment and sometimes observed in astronauts during long-duration space flight. Sequence comparison of the astronauts’ faecal microbiome to the Mars500 environmental microbiome revealed direct large-scale associations between the gut and environmental microbiomes, an observation made possible due to the extreme experimental confinement. Identification of significant species-level microbiome alterations which align with astronaut symptoms connects the Russian, European, Chinese and now Canadian Space Agency Mars500 studies. This initial evidence of a potentially deleterious impact of long-term confinement upon microbiome health is an important step forward in the current drive to enable long-duration spaceflight.Funding The project was funded by the Canadian Space Agency, Health and Life Sciences Data and Samples Mining award as well as an NSERC Discovery Grant (FEP RGPIN-2017-05452).Author contributions NJBB, FEP and EG all analysed and interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript.Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Canadian Space Agency for funding this research through a Health and Life Sciences Data and Samples Mining award.

Keywords: ATM, ATR, double-strand breaks, genomic instability, KU80, LIG4, radiationINTRODUCTION The function of a cell, its capacity to proliferate, and ultimately, its viability, are under constant threat from a diverse array of DNA damaging agents and events. Although any lesion can have deleterious effects on an organism, double strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most dangerous types of DNA damage a cell can sustain. The threat such a lesion poses to an organism is influenced by several important factors. The site of damage and the phase of the cell-cycle in which the damage occurs impact both a cell’s response to DSBs and their consequences (Rothkamm et al., 2003; Delacote and Lopez, 2008; Goodarzi et al., 2010). Furthermore, while some DSBs are relatively simple, more complex breaks may arise from secondary damage to the DNA backbone, damage to bases adjacent to the DSB, or the presence of multiple breaks in close proximity. Such variation in DSB complexity also plays an important role in governing the repair of these lesions (Mladenov et al., 2009). Ionizing radiation (IR) is a particularly potent DNA damaging agent that produces single strand breaks, oxidized bases, abasic sites, and DSBs of varying complexity (McGrath and Williams, 1966; Lehnert, 2008). The efficiency with which an ionizing particle transfers its energy to the medium it passes through, termed linear energy transfer (LET), plays an important role in the nature of the DNA damage caused by exposure to IR (Zirkle et al., 1952). Low LET particles, such as gamma rays and X-rays, deposit their energy inefficiently as they pass through a cell, resulting in widely scattered damage (Costes et al., 2007). Such damage is generally repaired via base excision or nucleotide excision repair in a largely error-free manor (Ward and Chen, 1998). High-LET particles, such as accelerated nucleons or high charge, high energy (HZE) particles, deposit their energy much more efficiently along a discreet track as they pass through matter, resulting in significantly more complex, clustered damage along the track (Goodhead, 1988; Nikjoo et al., 1998, 1999; Sutherland et al., 2001; Costes et al., 2007; Hada and Georgakilas, 2008). In human cell lines, the distribution of DSBs induced by HZE has been shown to lie along a well defined path through the nucleus, whereas gamma-induced DSBs are widely scattered; furthermore, HZE-induced γ-H2AX foci are often so closely packed, that individual foci are difficult to discern (Karlsson and Stenerlow, 2004; Costes et al., 2007). Although life on Earth’s surface is largely protected from exposure to high-LET radiation, it’s hazards are still of significant concern, particularly in the planning of long-duration space missions. Moreover, the damage sustained as a result of exposure to either low or high-LET radiation exhibits similarities with the damage caused by other more common DSB-inducing agents, and may provide insight into the response to and repair of such lesions. To investigate the immediate and long-term impacts high versus low-LET radiation have on plants, we employed the various DNA repair-deficient and cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient lines in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia, mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), members of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family, play important roles in governing the transcriptional response to DNA breakage and in the induction of cell-cycle arrest (Durocher and Jackson, 2001; Khanna and Jackson, 2001; Sancar et al., 2004; Culligan et al., 2006). While ATM and ATR have been shown to recognize DSBs and stalled replication forks respectively, it is clear that both kinases play important roles in the IR-induced DNA-damage response (Chen et al., 1999; Gatei et al., 2000; Abraham, 2001; Friesner et al., 2005; Ismail et al., 2005). Given the distinct nature of the lesions these proteins target, we were interested in the role these checkpoint genes play in responding to DNA damage of variable complexity as induced by exposure to high versus low-LET radiation. Lines lacking DNA ligase IV (LIG4) or KU70, important players in the canonical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, were also utilized to probe the importance of NHEJ and alternative repair pathways in the response to damage done by high and low-LET radiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS PLANT LINES The following DNA repair-deficient and cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient alleles were used in our root growth assay: atm-1 (Garcia et al., 2003), atr-3 (Culligan et al., 2004), lig4-1 (Friesner and Britt, 2003), and ku80-1 (Friesner and Britt, 2003); all of which are in the Ws ecotype. For our sectoring assay, we searched the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) database to identify alleles that might serve as an albino marker. The APG3 gene (albino/pale green mutant 3), located near the telomere of chromosome III, is essential in chloroplast development (Motohashi et al., 2007). Seedlings deficient for APG3 arrest development shortly after germination; as the name implies, cells deficient for APG3 lack pigment and are easily distinguished from those that retain a wild-type copy of the APG3 gene. A line harboring a T-DNA insertion in APG3 was ordered from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Syngenta stock “CS16118”; McElver et al., 2001). This particular allele, apg3-2, was selected both because the T-DNA construct used in generating this particular line imparts resistance to the herbicide Basta, and because of its clear and consistent albino phenotype; the presence of the Basta resistance (BAR) gene in this construct afforded us the ability to select for just those plants carrying the albino marker. To introduce the APG3 albino marker into our repair-deficient and checkpoint-deficient lines, we tried where possible, to choose alleles that did not already carry the BAR gene. We crossed apg3-2 with atm-1 (Garcia et al., 2003), atr-2 (Culligan et al., 2004), lig4-3 (Hefner et al., 2003, 2006), and ku80-1 (Friesner and Britt, 2003); the ecotype of apg3-2 and atr-2 is Col, that of atm-1 and ku80-1 is Ws, and that of lig4-3 is Ler.IONIZING RADIATION High-LET radiation treatments were administered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) (Upton, NY) using accelerated 56Fe nucleons with a beam size diameter of 20 cm and a dose rate of 7 Gy min-1. Following irradiation, samples remained at the NSRL facility for approximately 30 m until deactivated. Low-LET, gamma radiation treatments were carried out at BNL using a 137Cs source in the Controlled Environment Radiation Facility at a dose rate of up to 6 Gy min-1. A subset of the gamma radiation treatments done on samples for the albino sectoring assay were carried out using an alternate 137Cs source (Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Health, University of California, Davis, CA, USA) with a dose rate of 7 Gy min-1.PREPARATION OF SAMPLES USED IN ROOT GROWTH AND SECTORING ASSAYS Four to six days prior to irradiation, seeds used in the root growth assay were surface sterilized using a 20% bleach solution; sterilized seeds and seeds used in the sectoring assay were aliquoted, suspended in ddH2O, and stored at 4°C. Seeds were shipped overnight, on ice, to BNL where they were again stored at 4°C until the time of IR treatment. Samples were irradiated (See “Ionizing Radiation” above) with the doses indicated in the text and figures. Following treatment, the samples were repacked on ice and shipped overnight to the University of California, Davis. Upon arrival, seeds used in the sectoring assay were sown on soil (Sunshine Mix #1; Sungro, Bellevue, WA, USA) at a density of ~0.2 seeds cm-2 and placed in the growth chamber under clear plastic domes to maintain high humidity; seeds used in the root growth assay were sown on 1× nutrative MS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) Phytoagar (PlantMedia, Dublin, OH, USA) plates, pH 5.9, and placed vertically in the growth chamber. Seeds were grown under a simulated 16 h day/8 h night cycle using light from cool-white lamps (100-150 μmol m-2 s-1) filtered through Clear UV-filtering Protect-O-Sleeves (McGill Electrical Product Group, Rosemont, IL, USA). Plastic domes were partially removed from seeds used in the sectoring assay 3 days after sowing and fully removed after 5 days.MEASUREMENT OF ROOT LENGTH Digital images of the plated seeds were taken eight days after transfer to the growth chamber. The length of the primary root was determined using the public domain, image-processing program, ImageJ.QUANTIFICATION OF APG3 SECTORS Because the apg3-2 allele imparts resistance to the herbicide Basta, we were able to significantly reduce the number of plants it was necessary to screen for sectoring. Roughly 2 w after sowing, the number of healthy seedlings was determined. Plants were then treated with Basta (Finale, AgrEvo Environmental Health, Montvale, NJ, USA) and the number of resistant plants was determined in the following days. Resistant plants were scored for the presence of albino sectors approximately 3 weeks after sowing. The leaves of each plant were gently manipulated in order to inspect underlying leaves. Sectors were white or pale green in color, could be traced toward or along the petiole, and exhibited a relatively clear and well-defined boundary between the sector and the neighboring tissue; leaves that were clearly unhealthy or grossly deformed were not scored for sectors. While the number of Basta resistant plants might have been used to calculate such a frequency directly, the fact that In the case of the atm-1 mutant, this insertion allele also carries Basta resistance, and so seedlings in the next generation, after selection for Basa resistance, would be expected to segregate 2 apg3-2 het:1 APG3-2+/+. To correct for this, seeds were collected from a heterozygous parent, and the frequency of hets for apg3-2 was corrected for in the next generation. To estimate the frequency of sectoring in the progeny of heterozygous APG3± plants, we divided the number of plants with a sector by two-thirds the total number of healthy seedlings present 2 weeks after sowing.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF HZE 56Fe PARTICLES IS APPROXIMATELY 3-FOLD GREATER THAN THAT OF 137Cs GAMMA RAYS WITH RESPECT TO INHIBITION OF PRIMARY ROOT GROWTH To test the relative impact of high- versus low-LET radiation on root growth, a process governed by both cell division and cell expansion, seeds were irradiated with either high-LET 56Fe particles (HZE) or low-LET 137Cs gamma rays. The length of the primary root 8 days after planting (DAP), relative to the length in unirradiated seeds, is shown in Figure 1. Consistent with previously published data, exposure to increasingly higher doses of gamma radiation results in increased inhibition of root elongation (Jiang et al., 1997). A similar, though more pronounced trend is observed in seeds exposed to HZE. At doses of 100 Gy HZE or higher, root elongation appears to be almost completely inhibited in wild-type lines, though seeds irradiated at such doses are still capable of germination, indicating that the treated embryos remain alive. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Relative root growth of irradiated seeds 8 days after treatment. (A) Gamma treatment. (B) HZE treatment. Data points reflect results from three (n = 3) biological replicates in the case of atm, and atr and four (n = 4) biological replicates in the case of wild-type, lig4 and ku80 (Doses for which only a single biological replicate was performed are displayed as hollow data points.). Rootlengths from an average of 29 seedlings were scored per line, per treatment, per replicate. Lines represent interpolation of the data, fit to a sigmoid curve. Error bars depict standard error of the mean, as calculated and plotted by Microsoft Excel.Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), defined as the absorbed dose of radiation of a standard type (e.g. gamma) divided by the absorbed dose of radiation type “x” that causes the same amount of biological damage, offers a means of comparing how damaging different types of radiation are, given the same amount of absorbed energy; the larger the RBE for a type of radiation, the more damaging the radiation per unit energy deposited (Failla and Henshaw, 1931). The RBE of HZE versus gamma radiation was estimated by interpolating the dose response data to determine the dose at which the length of the primary root is reduced to 37% that of the untreated control (ID1/e; Table 1). In the case of both our wild-type and mutant lines, the effect of HZE on primary root growth is significantly greater than that of gamma rays. The biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma in our repair-deficient lines is slightly lower than observed in wild-type. Somewhat more variance is observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines. Lines deficient for ATM exhibit a slight increase in root sensitivity to HZE versus gamma radiation relative to wild-type (RBE = 3.63 versus 2.97), while lines deficient for ATR exhibit a slight decrease in their relative HZE sensitivity (2.09). Whether this shift in root hypersensitivity is a function of cell death resulting from a failed checkpoint induction, or from prolonged cell-cycle arrest is unclear from the root growth data.

In order to address the impact HZE and gamma radiation have on the integrity of the genome, we employed a sectoring assay to test for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in treated seeds (Preuss and Britt, 2003). An albino marker gene (apg3) near the tip of chromosome III was introduced to a series of DNA repair defective lines and checkpoint defective lines. While seedlings homozygous for the albino marker arrest and die shortly after germination, untreated seedlings heterozygous for the marker appear phenotypically identical to wild-type. Loss of the wt allele marker in a heterozygous single cell, whether as a result of anueploidy, loss of the distal portion of the chromosome, or mutation of the wild-type allele, followed by production of mutant cell files via cell division, results in the production of an albino sector (Figure 2, inset) The frequency with which these sectors occur within a population provides a measure of genomic stability (Yoshiyama et al., 2009). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Loss of heterozygosity following exposure to radiation. Loss of heterozygosity in wild-type plants treated with HZE (black line) and gamma (gray line) radiation. Data points represent the mean of three biological replicates; dashed lines depict linear regressions of datasets. Error bars depict standard deviation, as calculated by standard statistical methods in Mircosoft Excel. Inset: example of an IR-induced albino sector.As expected, under normal conditions, genomic stability in wild-type plants appears quite high. To obtain an estimate of the rate of spontaneous LOH at the APG3 locus in wild-type plants, 900 untreated plants were scored for the presence of an albino sector. Of the 900 plants scored, none exhibited the presence of a sector, suggesting a rate of spontaneous LOH per plant for this particular allele of less than 0.1%. In seeds treated with low does of either HZE or gamma radiation, sectoring increases with dose in a roughly linear, positive fashion (Figure 2). However, plants treated with higher doses are very small, and exhibit decreasing frequencies of sectoring/plant, perhaps simply because fewer cells are sampled per plant. Sectoring frequency in seeds treated with 56Fe particles was consistently higher than that observed in seeds treated with gamma rays; these results are consistent with the observation that in human cells, clustered damage generated by Fe ions leads to increases in chromosome breakage and genomic instability (Asaithamby et al., 2011). To obtain an estimate of the biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma radiation, in the context of long-term genomic stability, linear regressions were generated from the sectoring data (Figures 2 and 3, inset). Regressions were constrained such that they passed through the origin, and the ratio of the slopes from the HZE and gamma datasets was determined. In wild-type plants, a 3.33-fold increase in sectoring was observed in seeds treated with HZE as compared to those treated with gamma rays (Table 2). In the case of lig4 and ku80, the 50 Gy gamma and 200 Gy HZE datapoints were omitted in the regression analysis due to a drop-off in sectoring at higher doses as discussed in the following section.

As in the case of wild-type, at low doses, our lig4 and ku80 lines exhibited a roughly linear increase in the frequency of sectoring with exposure to increased levels of radiation; however, unlike our wild-type line, a significant drop-off in sectoring was observed at higher doses of either HZE or gamma radiation (Figure 3). Again, we believe this is due to the very small size of the repair-defect plants after irradiation at these doses. Of the mutant lines tested, plants lacking LIG4 exhibited the highest rate of sectoring following exposure to IR (Table 2). Although research has demonstrated that DSBs can be rejoined in the absence of LIG4, its role as the primary ligase involved in NHEJ is well documented (Grawunder et al., 1998; Tsukamoto and Ikeda, 1998; Junop et al., 2000; Friesner and Britt, 2003; van Attikum et al., 2003; Huefner et al., 2011). The increased rate of LOH in lig4 is almost certainly the result of persistent DSBs present during cell division; whether the structure of these breaks precludes other ligases from rejoining the broken ends, or the ends are repaired in a more error-prone fashion is unclear. KU80, another important component of NHEJ, also appears to be involved in maintaining genomic stability following exposure to IR. Other work has shown that while the KU complex plays an important role in governing the size of deletions and insertions at DSB repair sites and in stabilizing broken ends prior to ligation, end-joining can still occur in its absence (Ma et al., 2003; Boboila et al., 2010; Huefner et al., 2011). It is likely, therefore, that a relatively large portion of the broken DNA ends generated by IR are ultimately rejoined in our ku80 line resulting in the more moderate increase in sectoring observed in ku80 plants as compared to lig4 plants.THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ATM AND ATR IN MAINTAINING GENOMIC STABILITY DIFFERS IN RESPONSE TO HZE VERSUS GAMMA RADIATION As with our DNA repair-deficient lines, a significant increase in sectoring was observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines relative to wild-type (Figure 4). Such an increase is consistent with the role ATM and ATR play in governing the DSB driven, early G2/M phase arrest. Failure to properly arrest cells in response to DSBs could result in the presence of persistent DSBs during cell division, thereby leading to aneuploidy and LOH (Garcia et al., 2003; Culligan and Britt, 2008). ATM and ATR function synergistically in response to IR-induced DNA damage, functioning in some ways redundantly and in other ways distinctly to activate downstream targets, trigger cell-cycle arrest, and help drive DNA repair. In light of the fact that ATM is thought to respond directly to DSBs via interaction with proteins associated with the breaks (Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003; Lee and Paull, 2005), whereas ATR is thought to respond to the presence of persistent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Burrows and Elledge, 2008; Cimprich and Cortez, 2008), we were interested in whether ATM and ATR function differently in maintaining genomic stability in response to the damage caused by HZE versus gamma radiation. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Loss of heterozygosity in cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient plants in response to HZE and gamma radiation. Data points represent the mean of three biological replicates. Error bars depict standard deviation, calculated as before via Microsoft Excel. Inset: Linear regressions for each dataset.atm-1 seeds exposed to gamma radiation exhibit a 2.5-fold increase in the frequency of sectoring as compared to wild-type (calculated from the slopes reported in Table 2). A more moderate increase in sectoring, 1.9-fold, was observed in our atr line, suggesting that while both ATM and ATR play a role in maintaining genomic stability in response to gamma radiation exposure, ATM is of greater relative importance. In seeds exposed to HZE particles, an increase in sectoring was again observed in both atm and atr relative to wild-type. Fold increases of 1.9 and 2.2 were observed for atm and atr respectively, indicating a reversal in the relative importance of ATM and ATR in mitigating LOH in HZE versus gamma treated seeds, although these differences are small. Quantification of the RBE of HZE versus gamma, in terms of genomic stability, in our checkpoint-deficient lines demonstrates a decrease in the relative importance of ATM in response to HZE radiation as compared to wild-type (2.6 and 3.3, respectively), and an increase in the relative importance of ATR (3.9). Based on the LOH data, it appears that ATR plays a more important role in responding to the complex, clustered damage induced by HZE particles than it does in responding to damage induced by exposure to gamma radiation. Given that ATR responds to persistent ssDNA, one possible explanation for the increased importance ATR plays in response to HZE treatment, is that more ssDNA is produced directly upon exposure to HZE particles. Multiple nicks to the DNA backbone in close proximity to one another may produce significant stretches of ssDNA in conjunction with DSBs not typically present in breaks generated by low-LET radiation. Alternatively, ssDNA may also be produced secondarily in HZE treated cells as the cell attempts to repair the clustered damage via resection of damaged ends or excision of damaged nucleotides. In cells deficient for ATR, imposition of cell-cycle arrest in HZE treated cells may be abrogated or delayed, resulting in enhanced loss of heterozygosity in cells that divide before the damage can be resolved. This may also provide insight into the observation that relative to both wild-type and atm, root growth in atr is slightly more resistant to HZE treatment, given that affected cells, while incurring greater damage to the genome, may still be capable of cell division and expansion.CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate a clear difference in the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to high- versus low-LET radiation. Data from both our root hypersensitivity and LOH assays indicate that the RBE of HZE radiation is between two and four times that of gamma radiation. The increased sensitivity of plants to HZE suggests that not only the quantity, but also the complexity of DSBs induced by IR play an import part in determining the efficiency and accuracy of DNA repair. A significant decrease in the genomic stability of KU80-deficient and LIG4-deficient lines in response to both HZE and gamma radiation reflects the importance of C-NHEJ in the repair of both simple and complex DSBs. While it is unclear what additional factors may be unique to or of special importance in the repair DSBs induced by one class of radiation versus another, it is apparent that the relative importance of ATM versus ATR shifts in response to HZE versus gamma radiation. The increased relative importance of ATR versus ATM in responding to damage induced by HZE suggests that treatment with high-LET radiation results, either directly of indirectly, in a significant increase in the amount of ssDNA in the cell. Given the differences in the composition of DNA damage induced by HZE and gamma radiation, it will be interesting to determine what other differences exist in a cell’s response to both types of IR. Differences in response at the transcriptomics level are addressed in the accompanying paper.Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.Acknowledgments Experimental design by Anne B.

    "abstract": "Abstract Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic flights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and processing methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic flights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classification of all phases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Parabolic flights are cost-effective, ground-based analogs that achieve variable g (Earth-relative GIA) level environments that recreate conditions experienced during space flight.1,2 Specialized aircraft can maintain approximately 20–30 s of a 0 g, freefall environment before an increased GIA recovery phase (Fig. 1a). Modified trajectories can achieve reduced g levels experienced on the lunar surface or on Mars (0.17 and 0.38 g, respectively). Parabolic flights serve as valuable proving grounds for experimental efforts to maximize the research potential of the International Space Station3,4 and to accommodate increasing interest in commercial space flight.5,6 Fig. 1.

    "methods": "Methods Device Selection The Slam Stick X™ (Mide Technology Corp., www.mide.com) was selected based on its size (76 mm × 30 mm × 15 mm), low mass (65 g), integrated battery, manual and USB interfaces, and combination DC (Analog Devices ADXL345) and piezoelectric (TE 832M1) accelerometers to enable accuracy at both low (e.g., down to 0 Hz) and high frequencies (up to 20 kHz sample frequency). The aluminum body was selected to provide improved high frequency response. Additional integrated sensors included temperature and pressure (NXP MPL3115) and control pad temperature and pressure (TE MS8607). Alternative data acquisition systems include many commercial off the shelf (COTS) accelerometers, as well as the NASA Suborbital Flight Environment Monitor (SFEM)9. There may be potential benefits of using the SFEM, although the Slam Stick X™ offers comparable or longer recording time, DC and piezoelectric accelerometers (enabling both g level and high frequency vibration measurements), higher sampling frequencies, a wider operating temperature range (− 40 °C to + 80˚C) and much lower ( > 10 × ) mass and volume. Another COTS option is the Lansmont 3X90 , although the Slam Stick X™ specifications provide benefits in several areas (size, mass, sampling rates, and temperature range). One consideration for parabolic flight experiments is that the GIA environment is not constant across the aircraft. In some cases, it may be adequate to have a single reference flight profile to be used by multiple experiment teams. However, some applications may be better served through measurement of the local GIA environment of a given experimental apparatus. Here, the small size of our solution facilitates direct incorporation into a payload, as well as placement in the desired location or orientation. When selecting a data acquisition solution, it is also important to consider how the mounting of the accelerometer itself may impact the frequency response; in our case, use of double-sided sticky tape represents both an extremely practical and low bias option, enabled by the low device mass. Because no additional materials separate the accelerometer from the aircraft, there is no need to correct for the frequency response of the mounting interface. Device mounting and data acquisition Zero Gravity Corporation (ZGC) utilizes a standard system of mounting hardware to the aircraft structure consisting of a baseplate (61 cm × 61 cm × 1.27 cm aluminum plate, e.g., McMaster Carr 86825K25) bolted to the aircraft structure using four clearance holes at the corners of a square with 50.8 cm (20 in) sides, centered on the baseplate. Washers (McMaster Carr 92503A230) were used for mounting in combination with AN-6 steel bolts (3/8 inch) provided by ZGC. The Slam Stick X™ was mounted to a standard baseplate with double-sided sticky tape (3 M 950), which is the preferred mounting method due to its vibration frequency response (near unity) and robustness: this method has previously been validated during vibration testing at over 75 g at 1 kHz1. The Slam Stick X™ was configured using Slam Stick Lab 1.8. Acquisition was initiated and terminated manually using the control pad on the device. Sampling rates were 5 kHz (piezoelectric vibration sensor), 411 Hz (DC acceleration), and 1 Hz (pressure and temperature). Data calibration The raw IDE file generated by the Slam Stick X™ was converted to calibrated MAT (MATLAB, The Mathworks, Natick, MA) files using the ide2csv.exe command line utility (Mide Technology Corp.) using the factory calibration. Note that data calibration and export functions can also be performed directly using Slam Stick Lab. Here we focus on data from the DC accelerometer. We note that temperature varied less than 1 °C and pressure showed a typical regulated profile and was highly stable during parabolas (Supplementary Fig. 5). Orientation-independent approach In any given experiment, one accelerometer orientation may be more appropriate than another. Thus, we based our phase of flight identification method (below) on a measure that is independent of the accelerometer orientation: the Euclidean norm of the x, y, and z axes, which we hereafter refer to as the g level or g. As this variable is a positive scalar, it does not capture directional fluctuations in the gravity vector. Thus, for characterization of phases of flight, vector-based statistics should be used. For example, we estimated the mean g level during a 0 g parabola by averaging the x, y, and z components, and then computing the norm. Calibration verification The expected value of the g level is unity on Earth under non-accelerated conditions; as a verification of our accelerometer calibration, we found the norm under lab bench conditions (14.2 s recording) to be 0.9840 (rms) and 0.9840 ± 0.0055 (mean ± SD), consistent with < 2% error. This is a lower bound when vibration or specific force other than that caused by gravity is present, consistent with the rms value (1.07) observed during flight. Specific force was concentrated in the z axis as measured by root mean square (rms) values (0.0466, 0.0775, 1.0662 for x, y, and z axes, respectively), consistent with the accelerometer orientation (Fig. 1c). Calibration accuracy was also assessed after filtering (see below). Phase of flight characterization For parabola identification, we first filtered the raw data using a zero-phase 12th order Butterworth filter using the designfilt() function using a half power frequency (HPF) as described below. Next, we utilized change point detection7,8 as implemented by the MATLAB FindChangePts() function. Change point detection was first applied to the filtered g level gfilt to identify differences in mean g levels. A known number of change points was specified based on the parabola number within each set, e.g., two times the number of parabolas, plus two additional transitions (first pre-parabola pull up; last post-parabola pull up) for each set of parabolas. In our case sets of 5, 6, 4, and 5 (20 total) parabolas become 12, 14, 10, and 12 change points. This total number of change points (48) was specified and FindChangePts() identified all g level change points in an unsupervised manner (Fig. 1f). We desire to break down the flight into regions of stable g levels. Thus, for each change point, we used a secondary change point detection to identify differences in the slope of the g level vs. time curves. Data within 10 s of each change point was subjected to this secondary change point detection using a linear slope metric. This step successfully segmented the flight into regions of rapid “transition” (indicated by dotted lines, Fig. 1g-i) and more stable regimes. This resulted in 97 flight periods (2 × the number of change points + 1). Classification of non-“transition” flight periods into “parabola,” “hypergravity,” and “other” (which includes straight and level flight as well as standard rate turns) was then performed, first by categorizing any periods with duration > 100 s as “other”, then by segmenting data according to g level (“parabola” ≤ 0.9 g, 0.9 < “other” ≤ 1.1 g, “hypergravity > 1.1 g). Despite its simplicity, this classifier achieved good separation between classes (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phases of flight classification and characterization. a After identifying transitions, non-transition events were classified as duration < 100 s (horizontal line) and by mean g level (vertical dotted lines) into “parabola,” “hypergravity,” and “other.” The subset of “hypergravity” periods with lower duration were identified as those at the start or end of a set of parabolas. All phases of flight were unambiguously classified. b Parabola characteristics (see also: Supplementary Information). Error bars: mean ± SDParabola durations (mean ± s.d.) were 19.5 ± 1.4 s (0 g, N = 17, range 17 to 24 s), 23.7 s (Lunar g; N = 1), and 28.9 ± 0.7 s (Mars g; N = 2). The g levels achieved were 0.041 ± 0.005 g (0 g) and 0.159 g (lunar g). Both Mars parabolas achieved 0.356 g, indicating high consistency between parabolas targeting similar g levels. Higher g levels were significantly associated with longer-duration parabolas (Supplementary Fig. 4a), although not when lunar and Mars data were excluded (Supplemental Fig. 4b). Some limitations are inherent in our study, which focused solely on one flight and 20 parabolas. If analyzing multiple flights, with parabolas performed under more varied conditions, it is possible a slightly more complex classification strategy might be required; however, based on the wide separation between “parabola,” “hypergravity,” and “other” classes, this is not expected to present a significant challenge to standard unsupervised classification approaches (e.g., k-means). Filter optimization To optimize the filter, we selected a HPF based on the g level power spectral density (PSD, Supplementary Fig. 2a). The PSD was computed via the MATLAB pwelch() function with default parameters. To select the HPF, we examined the cumulative sum of the PSD (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which revealed a sharp increase in power above 0.01 Hz. We chose this value (HPF = 0.01 Hz) to maximize the low frequency content of the filtered data while rejecting as much spectral power from higher frequencies as possible. As an example, filtering at HPF = 0.01 Hz preserves parabola dynamics, whereas filtering at HPF = 0.001 Hz does not (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Our selected value provides the smoothest data for identifying parabolas, while still accurately representing g level transitions. A manual procedure identified similar values, e.g., adjusting the HPF toward DC until the rapid transitions between g levels showed systematic bias, then setting the HPF to 10 × this value, also gave HPF = 0.01 Hz. Filtering reduced the root mean square specific force in the lateral (x) direction but little in other directions (0.0161, 0.0681, 1.0623 for x, y, z, respectively), consistent with low frequency aircraft accelerations mainly due to pitch maneuvers. The g level was near unity during periods of relative calm (Supplemental Fig. 3a-b), including the first 1000 s of data collected during largely straight and level flight (rms 0.9919 and 0.9856, raw and filtered, respectively). This unfiltered estimate is 0.8% higher than under lab bench conditions, and both are consistent with accurate sensor calibration at DC to lower than 2% error, based on the factory calibration. Regression analysis Regression of parabola g level on duration was performed using the MATLAB fitlm() function. Confidence intervals were determined using the MATLAB coefCI() function.

Thus, our phase of flight identification is based on a metric that is independent of accelerometer orientation: the Euclidean norm of the accelerometer (x,y,z) axes, which we refer to as g level or g (Methods). To facilitate our analysis (Fig. 1d, Methods, Supplementary Figs. 1-5), acceleration data were filtered (Fig. 1e) using a zero-delay, low-pass filter prior to parabola identification using change point detection.7,8 Conceptually, this process finds the point for which a statistical property (e.g., mean), has minimum total residual error summed across two groups, e.g., before and after the change point. Here residual error is the difference between an observed value and the statistical property for the group. Change point detection was first applied to the filtered g level, gfilt, to identify differences in mean g levels in an unsupervised manner (Fig. 1f). To break down the flight into regions of stable g levels, data within 10 s of each change point was subjected to secondary change point detection using a linear slope metric, which segmented the flight into regions of rapid “transition” (indicated by dotted lines, Fig. 1g-i) and more stable regimes.

    "discussion": "Discussion Parabolic flights provide the opportunity to perform simulated space research in a cost-effective manner. Recently, Lambot and Ord (2016) evaluated data from over 400 parabolic flights and assessed the quality of reduced g datasets.9 Although considerable effort was dedicated to identifying the highest quality, low g time periods (with variations less than ± 0.01 g) from these flights, neither the acquisition hardware, the raw data, nor the code implemented for analysis, are currently available to the public. Indeed, when reviewing the literature, we found no such easily accessible parabolic flight acceleration data nor published analysis methodology. Here, we provide the following: (1) a commercially available hardware solution for data acquisition; (2) raw and calibrated data for all phases of flight; (3) data analysis methodology that is independent of accelerometer orientation, and (4) characterization of g levels and durations achieved for 20 parabolas. In addition, the code implementing our methodology to categorize all phases of flight and characterize g levels and durations of parabolas is publicly available in order to facilitate future parabolic flight research. In addition, our methods could be adapted to analysis of data from suborbital flights, drop towers, or studies involving launch and landing accelerations. Our hardware solution, the Slam Stick X™, offers a compact, flexible, low-power, high resolution solution for acceleration and vibration monitoring with favorable comparison to alternatives (Methods). The small size facilitates integration into experiments and measurement of the local GIA environment, which is not constant across the aircraft. In addition, mounting with double-sided tape is simple, robust, and does not impact the frequency response (Methods). Lambot and Ord9 identified a “sweet zone” in the middle of the parabola with low acceleration deviation. Our data are consistent with this conclusion (Supplementary Fig. 8), although Lambot and Ord9 used, after unspecified low-pass filtering, a much more stringent tolerance (± 0.01 g) that was not met by our filtered data. We encourage future parabolic flight experimenters to release raw data as well as to provide data processing details (ideally including in executable form) to facilitate validation and improvement of processing algorithms, as well as refine expected g levels and support planning and analysis that can be tailored to specific experimenter needs. Due to the limited availability and high cost of actual space environments, it is imperative that we continue to utilize parabolic flights as a means to simulate space – and to understand the accuracy and limitations of this modality. By making our data and methods available we hope to enable others to better plan, execute, and analyze parabolic flight experiments, and thus to help facilitate future space activities.",

Copyright notice ID: 6081456 PMID: 30109261 Abstract Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic flights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and processing methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic flights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classification of all phases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities.Introduction Parabolic flights are cost-effective, ground-based analogs that achieve variable g (Earth-relative GIA) level environments that recreate conditions experienced during space flight.1,2 Specialized aircraft can maintain approximately 20–30 s of a 0 g, freefall environment before an increased GIA recovery phase (Fig. 1a). Modified trajectories can achieve reduced g levels experienced on the lunar surface or on Mars (0.17 and 0.38 g, respectively). Parabolic flights serve as valuable proving grounds for experimental efforts to maximize the research potential of the International Space Station3,4 and to accommodate increasing interest in commercial space flight.5,6 Fig. 1.

Open in a new tab Phases of flight classification and characterization. a After identifying transitions, non-transition events were classified as duration < 100 s (horizontal line) and by mean g level (vertical dotted lines) into “parabola,” “hypergravity,” and “other.” The subset of “hypergravity” periods with lower duration were identified as those at the start or end of a set of parabolas. All phases of flight were unambiguously classified. b Parabola characteristics (see also: Supplementary Information). Error bars: mean ± SDParabola durations (mean ± s.d.) were 19.5 ± 1.4 s (0 g, N = 17, range 17 to 24 s), 23.7 s (Lunar g; N = 1), and 28.9 ± 0.7 s (Mars g; N = 2). The g levels achieved were 0.041 ± 0.005 g (0 g) and 0.159 g (lunar g). Both Mars parabolas achieved 0.356 g, indicating high consistency between parabolas targeting similar g levels. Higher g levels were significantly associated with longer-duration parabolas (Supplementary Fig. 4a), although not when lunar and Mars data were excluded (Supplemental Fig. 4b). Some limitations are inherent in our study, which focused solely on one flight and 20 parabolas. If analyzing multiple flights, with parabolas performed under more varied conditions, it is possible a slightly more complex classification strategy might be required; however, based on the wide separation between “parabola,” “hypergravity,” and “other” classes, this is not expected to present a significant challenge to standard unsupervised classification approaches (e.g., k-means).Filter optimization To optimize the filter, we selected a HPF based on the g level power spectral density (PSD, Supplementary Fig. 2a). The PSD was computed via the MATLAB pwelch() function with default parameters. To select the HPF, we examined the cumulative sum of the PSD (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which revealed a sharp increase in power above 0.01 Hz. We chose this value (HPF = 0.01 Hz) to maximize the low frequency content of the filtered data while rejecting as much spectral power from higher frequencies as possible. As an example, filtering at HPF = 0.01 Hz preserves parabola dynamics, whereas filtering at HPF = 0.001 Hz does not (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Our selected value provides the smoothest data for identifying parabolas, while still accurately representing g level transitions. A manual procedure identified similar values, e.g., adjusting the HPF toward DC until the rapid transitions between g levels showed systematic bias, then setting the HPF to 10 × this value, also gave HPF = 0.01 Hz. Filtering reduced the root mean square specific force in the lateral (x) direction but little in other directions (0.0161, 0.0681, 1.0623 for x, y, z, respectively), consistent with low frequency aircraft accelerations mainly due to pitch maneuvers. The g level was near unity during periods of relative calm (Supplemental Fig. 3a-b), including the first 1000 s of data collected during largely straight and level flight (rms 0.9919 and 0.9856, raw and filtered, respectively). This unfiltered estimate is 0.8% higher than under lab bench conditions, and both are consistent with accurate sensor calibration at DC to lower than 2% error, based on the factory calibration.Regression analysis Regression of parabola g level on duration was performed using the MATLAB fitlm() function. Confidence intervals were determined using the MATLAB coefCI() function.Code availability The MATLAB scripts implementing our analysis are available at: https://github.com/CarrCE/zerog.Data availability Raw and calibrated data are available via the Open Science Framework at: https://osf.io/nk2w4/.Electronic supplementary material 41526_2018_50_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (3.3MB, pdf) Supplementary Information: Acceleration Profiles and Processing Methods for Parabolic Flight Acknowledgements We thank the MIT Media Lab Space Exploration Initiative for providing the parabolic flight.
