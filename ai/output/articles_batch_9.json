The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Under microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. Animal experiments have facilitated the investigation of the structural changes in the myocardium and skeletal muscles that arise during space flights. Previous research has revealed atrophic changes in the skeletal muscles of rats after space flight [1–4]. Moreover, early readaptation leads to more pronounced negative changes in the structure of muscle fibers than those observed immediately after the flight [5–7]. A fluid shift in the cranial direction [8, 9] and changes in systolic output [10–12] that are observed under conditions of weightlessness, could lead to functional changes in the cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, despite the decrease in the functional capabilities of the myocardium under conditions of microgravity, structural changes in the myocardium have not been observed after landing [1]. Data obtained from murine cardiomyocytes after the flight of the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 (dissection was carried out within 13–16.5 hours after landing) indicated that the levels of cytoskeletal proteins (beta- and gamma-actin, actin-binding proteins, desmin, and tubulin), as well as the expression levels of the genes encoding those proteins, were significantly changed after a 30-day space flight [13]. In the same experiment, Povysheva T.V. et al. showed that there were also changes in the structure of the myelinated fibers [14]. Similar effects were also observed in cells cultivated under conditions simulating the effects of microgravity. It was shown under such conditions, a change in the structure of microfilaments and microtubules occurs in mesenchymal stem and embryonic stem cells, leading to a change in the cellular shape and differentiation potential [15–21]. Moreover, it was shown by live-cell imaging that poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells (FTC-133) developed less aggressive phenotypes under microgravity conditions [22]. However, recently obtained data indicate that under conditions of real weightlessness, the rearrangements of F-actin and intermediate filaments were not observed in macrophages [23]. The effects of microgravity on gene expression have been documented in mammalian cells [24, 25] and other model organisms, such as yeast and bacteria [26–28]. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear. DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic factors [29]. Although methylation patterns are established during development, environmental conditions can also induce changes in these patterns [30]. Thus, Weaver I.C. et al. showed that different maternal care leads to different methylation patterns of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (and correlates with its expression) in young rats and that these effects persist even into adulthood [31]. To date, very few studies have been dedicated to the analysis of DNA methylation levels in space flight conditions or the modeling of the subsequent effects on Earth. Ou X. et al. [32] conducted experiments with rice plants during space flight and only showed hypermethylation that correlated with the transcription levels of genes. In contrast, Singh K.P. et al. [33] studied human T-lymphocyte cells, which were grown in a rotary cell culture system, and showed hypomethylation of the DNA. Chowdhury B. et al. [34] used TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells and ground-based simulation of microgravity with an HARV Rotary Cell Culture System for 48 hours and revealed that simulated microgravity induced alterations in the methylome (~60% of the differentially methylated regions or DMRs were hypomethylated and ~92% of the differentially hydroxymethylated regions or DHMRs were hyperhydroxymethylated). Therefore, there is a substantial amount of conflicting data regarding the effects of space flight on cell structure and the regulation of transcription, which may be due to varying periods between landing and biomaterial fixation. We suggest that for cardiac tissue, the early period of readaptation is accompanied by a decrease in volume load due to fluid shift. It could lead to the changes of the cortical cytoskeleton structure that were observed after the BION-M1 mission [13]. Therefore, we were interested in comparing the data from that biomaterial with data from biomaterial fixed under weightlessness conditions to avoid landing and readaptation effects. It can be assumed that such a strategy could provide us with a unique possibility to find methods for future investigations with the aim of protecting humans subjected to long-term space flight and the subsequent readaptation to Earth’s gravity and possibly that of Mars. The Rodent Research-1 experiment provided such an opportunity. In this paper, we present the results of a study of mouse heart and lung tissues obtained from the Rodent Research-1 experiment, where the biomaterial was fixed under space flight conditions in the US Orbital Segment of the ISS. We tested the protein and mRNA levels of the same cytoskeletal proteins (beta-actin, gamma-actin, alpha-actin-1, alpha-actinin-4, tubulin, and desmin) and compared the results to the previously observed data. In addition, after observing the relative changes in mRNA expression, we analyzed one of the possible factors affecting gene expression, total DNA methylation and its regulation.",

The mRNA contents of Des (Fig 3A), Actn4 (Fig 3B), Cct5, Cct7 (Fig 3C), Cycs, and Gapdh (Fig 3D) in group F were reduced compared to those in group G by 72% (p < 0.05), 35% (p < 0.05), 44% (p < 0.05), 41% (p < 0.05), 31% (p < 0.05), and 29% (p < 0.05), respectively.

The Actn1 mRNA content of group F increased by 58% compared to that of group G (p < 0.05) (Fig 4B). The relative mRNA contents of the Actg, Arpc3, Lcp1, and BetaTub genes were unchanged in group F compared to group G (Fig 4A and 4B). DNA total methylation level The level of total DNA methylation in groups B and V did not differ from that in group G in either the cardiac or the lung tissue. In the flight group, F, the level of total DNA methylation was higher than that in the control group G by 21% (p < 0.05) in the cardiac tissue and by 32% (p < 0.05) in the lung tissue (Figs 5 and 6). In addition, the major changes in the methylation levels were associated with the methylation of the internal cytosine at the 5’-CCGG-3’ locus, and thus, no changes in the efficiency of MspI (which is blocked by methylation of exogenous cytosine) were observed in any of the study groups (Fig 6).

    "discussion": "Discussion The influence of the changes in external mechanical conditions, particularly gravity changes, on the cells of organisms that have evolved in Earth’s gravity conditions is still poorly understood. The main difficulty is the extrapolation of ground experimental data to the prediction of results under weightlessness conditions. Previous experiments conducted under space flight conditions were limited by the fact that the biomaterial of the flight animals could only be fixed after landing, usually occurring a few hours after the landing [1–7, 13]. Therefore, this experiment is the first in the history of human space exploration with the unique opportunity to fix mouse biomaterial under space flight conditions. Comparing these results with the results obtained after the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 flight of the same length, a number of deductions can be made regarding the structural changes in the cells as a result of the early period of readaptation to Earth’s gravity. Long duration microgravity does not lead to notable changes in cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue The relative contents of beta-actin, gamma-actin, beta-tubulin and desmin both in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cardiac tissue remained at the same level in all the study groups. These data agree with data Tauber S. et al. showed for macrophages, which were also recorded under weightlessness conditions in the ISS (Space-X3 mission). In addition, changes of the cytoskeleton structure after an 11-day spaceflight were not observed [23]. The contents of the actin-binding proteins alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4 in the membrane fraction were also unchanged. However, in the cytoplasmic fraction, alpha-actinin-1 decreased by 40% (p < 0.05), and alpha-actinin-4 decreased by 30% (p < 0.05) in group F compared to group G. The previous data from the 30-day space flight of the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 (2013, Russia) showed that the beta-actin content in the membrane fraction of proteins was at the same level, while in the cytoplasmic fraction, there was a decrease in the beta-actin protein and mRNA expression levels in the flight group [13]. The gamma-actin mRNA and protein contents were unchanged. The alpha-actinin-1 protein content remained unchanged in the post-flight group, while the corresponding mRNA content was higher in the post-flight group than in the control groups. The alpha-actinin-4 protein content in the membrane fraction was reduced by 28% (p < 0.05) in group F compared to the control, although there was not a similar change in the cytoplasmic fraction. At the same time, the corresponding gene expression was reduced by 18% [13]. The principal difference between the RR-1 and BION-M No. 1 experiments is that the biomaterial in the RR-1 experiment was fixed under space flight conditions, and the biomaterial in the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 experiment was fixed within 13 hours after landing, i.e., there was a brief period of readaptation. In addition, another critical point is the effects of congestion during landing. However, overload during early readaptation is also a sharp increase of the external mechanical load. Earlier, we proposed a model wherein changes of the external mechanical load can lead to the dissociation of actin-binding proteins from the cortical cytoskeleton and the triggering signaling pathways, leading to a change in the expression level of the corresponding genes, which in turn leads to a redistribution of cytoskeletal proteins between the cellular compartments [38]. Comparison of the data obtained from the RR-1 experiment with the data of the BION-M biosatellite experiment (Table 2) suggests that long-term space flight leads to a decrease in the expression levels of alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4 in the cytoplasmic fraction of cardiac proteins. Thirteen hours under Earth’s gravity after a long-term space flight causes a reduction in the beta-actin content in the cytoplasmic fraction of proteins, the recovery of the alpha-actinin-1 content to the reference level and the reallocation of alpha-actinin-4 between the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Table 2. Comparison of the RR-1 experiment with BION-M No.1 experiment (for cardiac tissue).

Cytoskeleton changes, observed in the early period of readaptation, can subsequently affect myocardial function. Summarizing these data, it can be assumed that the early period of readaptation is more damaging than space flight. Therefore, we can suggest that the development of protective measures could possibly focus on preparing for landing. It should be noted that only minor changes in the protein contents in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cardiac tissue were found, and no changes were detected in the lung tissue. Therefore, this finding raises the question of whether the absence of changes in the protein contents was associated with the absence of changes in gene expression and/or changes in translation/proteolysis efficiency. Thus, qRT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA content. For the cardiac tissue, we found no changes in the mRNA contents of genes encoding the isoforms of actin and tubulin (the protein contents were also unchanged). The mRNA content of the alpha-actinin-4 gene was reduced, as was the protein content. At the same time, in the cardiac and lung tissue, there was a decrease of the desmin mRNA content with an absence of the protein content. In addition to the desmin mRNA changes in the lung tissue with an absence of consequent protein content changes, the beta-actin mRNA content was also decreased. This finding suggests an increase of translation efficiency and/or decrease in the efficiency of the proteolysis of these proteins. One possible method is the release of phospholipase D, which leads to an increase in translation efficiency. In turn, phospholipase D associates with alpha-actinin-1, which inhibits their activity [39]. Accordingly, if the formation of the protein pattern in the weightlessness (after short-term duration) passed the stage of the cytoskeleton reorganization (it can be assumed on the basis of a number of model experiments [40, 41, 42]), phospholipase D could be released, leading to the formation of the observed protein pattern after long-term duration in the microgravity conditions. However, in the absence of changes in the alpha-actinin-1 mRNA content, the protein content in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes decreased; in the lung tissue, the alpha-actinin-1 protein content remained at control levels, but the mRNA content increased. Alpha-actinin-1 is a member of the spectrin family [43], which is located along stress-fibrils and connects microfilament bundles [44]. Alpha-actinin-1 (as well as alpha-actinin-4) is a non-muscle isoform of the alpha-actinins, but it is expressed in cardiomyocytes [45] and is able to interact with a large number of signaling molecules and transcriptional factors [46, 47]. The reduction of the alpha-actinin-1 content may occur in the cytoplasmic fraction as a result of its migration into the nucleus. Although we did not detect alpha-actinin-1 in the nucleus, its highly homologous protein alpha-actinin-4 can transfer to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of certain genes [48]. It should be mentioned that procedure of freeze-defrost-freeze for the estimated tissues could lead to decreased protein content. However, we estimated the relative contents of the proteins and mRNA. Because we compared the flight group results with those of the control groups and the procedure for all groups was identical, we can estimate relative changes in the flight group. Total transcriptional efficiency of DNA of mouse cardiac and lung tissue after a long duration space flight The cause of the reduction of the mRNA content of certain genes that encode cytoskeletal proteins remains unclear. The transcription efficiency of eukaryotic promoters, especially in higher animals, is closely related to the level of genome methylation. DNA from mammalian somatic tissue is methylated in 70% of all CpG sites [49]. The key exceptions to this global methylation are the CpG islands, which mark the promoters and 5’- domains of genes [50]. The reported data regarding DNA methylation in rice plants, human T-lymphocyte cells and human lymphoblastoid cells under space flight conditions and the results of modeling experiments suggest that DNA methylation patterns change [32, 33, 34]. Therefore, we decided to estimate the total methylation level in our samples. We showed that methylation in the mouse cardiac and lung tissue shifted to hypermethylation after a 37-day space flight. In addition, these data agreed with the data that Ou X. et al. [32] obtained after space flight. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes of the methylation levels after space flight are currently unknown. The methylation level of the genome increased because heavy ions radiation, which can make a difference in the space flight conditions [51, 52]. In addition, this can contribute to the observed increase in the methylation level in the flight group. However, this contribution is unlikely to be decisive, since this experiment was conducted on board an International Space Station. Animals and humans were in the same compartments, which have both special protection against cosmic radiation and natural protection, since the orbit passes below the Earth's magnetosphere. In general, it is known that that de novo methylation can be mediated by histone deacetylation in the nucleosome area [53–58]. In addition, changes of methylation levels can result from increases in the methylase activity/content. Singh K.P. et al. [33] showed that the expression levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b were increased at 72 h and decreased at 7 days in microgravity-exposed cells, but at the same time, there was decreased expression of HDAC1. The authors suggested that the decreased expression of HDAC1 would result in an increased level of acetylated histone H3; however, a decreased level of acetylated H3 was observed under the microgravity condition, which indicated that other HDACs may be involved in the regulation of H3 deacetylation [33]. Ou X. et al. [32] found that several genes encoding the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler (DDM1) and siRNA-related proteins are extremely sensitive to perturbation by space flight, which may be an underlying cause for the altered methylation patterns in plants subjected to space flight. Therefore, we decided to assess the expression level of genes encoding methylases as well as the basic histone acetylase/deacetylase. The obtained results indicate that the gene expression levels of the histone aminotransferase Hat1, the histone deacetylase Hdac1, and the cytosine methylases Dnmt1 (S-phase methylation) and Dnmt3A (de novo methylation) were unchanged under weightlessness conditions. On the other hand, the methylation level can increase as a result of a reduction of the intensity of active DNA demethylation. Researchers believe that 5 hmC is the intermediate product in the process of active DNA demethylation [59–63] and is generated by Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) protein-mediated oxidative catalysis of 5mC [64]. Therefore, we measured the mRNA content of cytosine demethylases (Tet1, Tet2, Tet3) in the tested tissues. There were no changes in Tet1 and Tet3 mRNA content, but there was a significant decrease Tet2 mRNA content in mouse cardiac and lungs tissues. The data regarding Tet2 contents are quite limited and inconsistent; in TET2-mutated acute myeloid leukemia samples, Ko M. et al. [65] observed DNA hypomethylation, but Figueroa M.E. et al. [66] showed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype. Moreover, Menon M.P. et al. [67] showed that patients with primary central nervous system T-cell lymphomas had tumor cell necrosis as well as mutations of a number of genes, in particular TET2, the products of which are involved in the regulation of transcription efficiency. Thus, in our experiment, we can only assume that the mechanism of the change in total methylation levels in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice was associated with the decrease in the Tet2 mRNA content under space flight conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Our study, in which murine biomaterial was fixed for the first time under space flight conditions (after 37 days of weightlessness), showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice. At the same time, there were significant changes in the mRNA content, which, on the one hand, indicates changes in translation efficiency and/or proteolysis levels that act to maintain normal levels of proteins and on the other hand, indicates the alteration of the expression levels of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins, perhaps as a result of the total genome methylation increase. The mRNA contents of the DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase were unchanged, and the mRNA content of the cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased, which could cause changes in the total methylation level.",

Copyright notice ID: 5955502 PMID: 29768411 Abstract The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of multiple cytoskeletal proteins in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice that were euthanized onboard the United States Orbital Segment of the International Space Station 37 days after the start of the SpaceX-4 mission (September 2014, USA). The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.Introduction Under microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. Animal experiments have facilitated the investigation of the structural changes in the myocardium and skeletal muscles that arise during space flights. Previous research has revealed atrophic changes in the skeletal muscles of rats after space flight [1–4]. Moreover, early readaptation leads to more pronounced negative changes in the structure of muscle fibers than those observed immediately after the flight [5–7]. A fluid shift in the cranial direction [8, 9] and changes in systolic output [10–12] that are observed under conditions of weightlessness, could lead to functional changes in the cardiovascular system. Nevertheless, despite the decrease in the functional capabilities of the myocardium under conditions of microgravity, structural changes in the myocardium have not been observed after landing [1]. Data obtained from murine cardiomyocytes after the flight of the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 (dissection was carried out within 13–16.5 hours after landing) indicated that the levels of cytoskeletal proteins (beta- and gamma-actin, actin-binding proteins, desmin, and tubulin), as well as the expression levels of the genes encoding those proteins, were significantly changed after a 30-day space flight [13]. In the same experiment, Povysheva T.V. et al. showed that there were also changes in the structure of the myelinated fibers [14]. Similar effects were also observed in cells cultivated under conditions simulating the effects of microgravity. It was shown under such conditions, a change in the structure of microfilaments and microtubules occurs in mesenchymal stem and embryonic stem cells, leading to a change in the cellular shape and differentiation potential [15–21]. Moreover, it was shown by live-cell imaging that poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells (FTC-133) developed less aggressive phenotypes under microgravity conditions [22]. However, recently obtained data indicate that under conditions of real weightlessness, the rearrangements of F-actin and intermediate filaments were not observed in macrophages [23]. The effects of microgravity on gene expression have been documented in mammalian cells [24, 25] and other model organisms, such as yeast and bacteria [26–28]. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear. DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic factors [29]. Although methylation patterns are established during development, environmental conditions can also induce changes in these patterns [30]. Thus, Weaver I.C. et al. showed that different maternal care leads to different methylation patterns of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (and correlates with its expression) in young rats and that these effects persist even into adulthood [31]. To date, very few studies have been dedicated to the analysis of DNA methylation levels in space flight conditions or the modeling of the subsequent effects on Earth. Ou X. et al. [32] conducted experiments with rice plants during space flight and only showed hypermethylation that correlated with the transcription levels of genes. In contrast, Singh K.P. et al. [33] studied human T-lymphocyte cells, which were grown in a rotary cell culture system, and showed hypomethylation of the DNA. Chowdhury B. et al. [34] used TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells and ground-based simulation of microgravity with an HARV Rotary Cell Culture System for 48 hours and revealed that simulated microgravity induced alterations in the methylome (~60% of the differentially methylated regions or DMRs were hypomethylated and ~92% of the differentially hydroxymethylated regions or DHMRs were hyperhydroxymethylated). Therefore, there is a substantial amount of conflicting data regarding the effects of space flight on cell structure and the regulation of transcription, which may be due to varying periods between landing and biomaterial fixation. We suggest that for cardiac tissue, the early period of readaptation is accompanied by a decrease in volume load due to fluid shift. It could lead to the changes of the cortical cytoskeleton structure that were observed after the BION-M1 mission [13]. Therefore, we were interested in comparing the data from that biomaterial with data from biomaterial fixed under weightlessness conditions to avoid landing and readaptation effects. It can be assumed that such a strategy could provide us with a unique possibility to find methods for future investigations with the aim of protecting humans subjected to long-term space flight and the subsequent readaptation to Earth’s gravity and possibly that of Mars. The Rodent Research-1 experiment provided such an opportunity. In this paper, we present the results of a study of mouse heart and lung tissues obtained from the Rodent Research-1 experiment, where the biomaterial was fixed under space flight conditions in the US Orbital Segment of the ISS. We tested the protein and mRNA levels of the same cytoskeletal proteins (beta-actin, gamma-actin, alpha-actin-1, alpha-actinin-4, tubulin, and desmin) and compared the results to the previously observed data. In addition, after observing the relative changes in mRNA expression, we analyzed one of the possible factors affecting gene expression, total DNA methylation and its regulation.Materials and methods Experimental design C57Bl6/J mice were used (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) in the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) experiment. The date of birth of the mice was June 3, 2014. The adaptation period was approximately 4 weeks. The age of the mice at the time of the launch was 16 weeks. The animals were placed in a transport container (10 mice in each container divided into 2 parts) on September 19, 2014. For two days, the transport container remained in the Dragon spacecraft capsule at the launch table. The SpaceX-4 spacecraft was launched on September 21, 2014. The animals were transferred from the transport container to the animal habitat block on the ISS (5 mice per block divided into 2 parts) on September 25, 2014. The biomaterial sampling schedule was as follows. 22 September 2014: Animals of the basal control group (B) were euthanized at the laboratory shortly after the launch. 28 October 2014: Animals of the flight group (F) were euthanized onboard the ISS 37 days after the launch (after a 33-day stay on the ISS with food and water provided ad libitum). 31 October 2014: Animals of the vivarium control group (V), which were housed in standard vivarium conditions, were euthanized. 01 November 2014: Animals of the ground control group (G) were euthanized at the laboratory after spending the same amount of time as the flight duration in the chamber simulating the conditions of the environment on the ISS located in the John F. Kennedy Space Center (USA). The mice used in this study were immediately frozen after euthanasia without biomaterial isolation. The time from cervical dislocation to the freezing of the carcasses was approximately 2 minutes. The carcasses were wrapped in two layers of foil and placed into plastic bags, which were then inserted into bags intended for storage at low temperatures (packed with 3 pre-chilled ice packs). The bags were stored in the MELFI freezer (-80°C) located in the USOS of the ISS until the return to the Earth. The biomaterial was delivered to Earth by SpaceX-5 (landed 11 February 2015). The schedule of the work with the animals in the ground and vivarium control groups matched the schedule of the work with the animals on the flight. All animal procedures were approved by the Ames Institution Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol CAS-13-001-Y1, approved May 13, 2014, Ames, USA). The organs were isolated from the frozen carcasses on Earth by our colleagues from the Ames Research Center of NASA. The dissections were performed after defrosting the carcasses to +4°C. The dissection procedure used for the control groups was identical to that used for the flight group. After isolation, the right side of the heart and one lung were frozen in liquid nitrogen and the left ventricle of the heart and the second lung were placed in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Qiagen, Germany). We investigated the biomaterial of 5 animals from each group (n = 5 for each group). All tests were carried out at least three times for each sample. The obtained samples, according to the NASA-Roscosmos protocol “Utilization Sharing Plan On-Board ISS” (signed on July 18, 2013), were delivered to the Russian Federation in dry ice without defrosting, which was controlled by temperature detectors.Determination of the protein content levels using gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting One of the lungs and the right side of the heart were frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent determination of the content of several cytoskeletal proteins. Tissue extracts were used to prepare the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of the proteins [35]. Denaturing electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels was performed using the Laemmli method and a Bio-Rad system (USA). Based on the measured concentration, an equal amount of protein was placed into each well, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane [36]. The following specific primary monoclonal antibodies were used at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturers to determine the levels of each protein: mouse antibodies against beta-actin (diluted 1:300), gamma-actin (diluted 1:100), alpha-actinin-1 (diluted 1:100), alpha-actinin-4 (diluted1:100), desmin (diluted 1:300) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA), and rabbit antibodies against beta-tubulin (diluted 1:1000) (Pierce Thermo Scientific, Inc., USA). Biotinylated goat antibodies were used as the secondary antibodies to detect rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab, Inc., USA) at a dilution of 1:10,000; to detect mouse IgG (Sigma, Germany), the secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:20,000. Afterwards, all the membranes were treated with a streptavidin solution conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, Germany) that was diluted 1:10,000. Protein bands were detected using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Merck, USA). The ImageJ program was used to analyze the obtained data.Determination of mRNA content using quantitative PCR method Total RNA was isolated from the left ventricle of the heart and the lungs, stabilized in RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Qiagen, Germany), and isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to perform the target analysis of the mRNA content of the genes that encode a number of cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins, as well as different cytosine methylases and demethylases, and histone acetylase and deacetylase. Reverse transcription was performed using d(T)15, and 500 ng of RNA was used as an inoculum, controlled by measuring the concentration. After reverse transcription, the amount of cDNA was measured. To avoid artifacts, all samples had at least three replicates. Real-time PCR was performed using the primers selected via the Primer3Plus program (Table 1) to assess the expression levels of the studied genes. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method [37] was used to determine the fold change. Table 1. Primer sequences and product sizes.

For the total CpG methylation analysis at the 5’-CCGG-3’ locus, an EpiJET Methylation Analysis Kit (MspI/HpaII) (Thermo Scientific, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When the internal CpG in the 5’-CCGG-3’ tetranucleotide is methylated, cleavage by Epi HpaII is blocked, but cleavage by Epi MspI is not affected. During the restriction digest, 1 μg of genomic DNA and 2 μg of unmethylated plasmid DNA pUC DNA/SmaI and fully methylated plasmid DNA mpUC DNA/SmaI were used in the absence of DNA degradation in the buffer as a control for the restriction and efficiency of the MspI and HpaII enzymes. The restriction results analysis was carried out in a 1% agarose gel with a size marker, FastRuler Middle Range DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific, USA), and the results were processed with the Image Lab program (Bio-Rad, USA), with normalization of the total content of the undigested genomic DNA in the corresponding sample.Statistical analysis The results obtained from the determination of the protein and mRNA expression levels and the methylation level were analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc t-test, and a significance level of p < 0.05 was applied to assess the significance of differences between the groups. The data are presented as the M±SE, where M represents the mean, and SE represents the standard error of the mean. All data used to build graphs were uploaded to the Dryad Digital Repository (doi:10.5061/dryad.h2j2466).Results Cytoskeletal protein content in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions The relative contents of beta-actin, gamma-actin, alpha-actinin-1, alpha-actinin-4, and beta-tubulin in the membrane fraction of the right ventricle of the heart were similar among the B, V, G and F groups (Fig 1). In the cytoplasmic fraction, the relative protein contents of beta-actin (Fig 1C), gamma-actin (Fig 1D), beta-tubulin (Fig 1E), and desmin (Fig 1F) were also unchanged in groups B, V, G and F. At the same time, the relative protein contents of alpha-actinin-1 (Fig 1A) and alpha-actinin-4 (Fig 1B) decreased by 40% (p < 0.05) and 30% (p < 0.05), respectively, in group F compared to group G.

We failed to isolate total protein of the membrane fraction of lung tissue that was of adequate quality in groups B and V, but in this case, no differences between groups G and F were found (Fig 2).

The mRNA contents of Des (Fig 3A), Actn4 (Fig 3B), Cct5, Cct7 (Fig 3C), Cycs, and Gapdh (Fig 3D) in group F were reduced compared to those in group G by 72% (p < 0.05), 35% (p < 0.05), 44% (p < 0.05), 41% (p < 0.05), 31% (p < 0.05), and 29% (p < 0.05), respectively. In the lung tissue, the relative mRNA contents of group F compared to that of group G decreased by 25% for Actb (p < 0.05), 29% for Des (p < 0.05) (Fig 4A), 41% for Svil (p < 0.05), 72% for Actn4 (p < 0.05) (Fig 4B), 35% for Cct7 (p < 0.05) (Fig 4C), 58% for Cycs (p < 0.05), and 32% for Gapdh (p < 0.05) (Fig 4D). The Actn1 mRNA content of group F increased by 58% compared to that of group G (p < 0.05) (Fig 4B). The relative mRNA contents of the Actg, Arpc3, Lcp1, and BetaTub genes were unchanged in group F compared to group G (Fig 4A and 4B).DNA total methylation level The level of total DNA methylation in groups B and V did not differ from that in group G in either the cardiac or the lung tissue. In the flight group, F, the level of total DNA methylation was higher than that in the control group G by 21% (p < 0.05) in the cardiac tissue and by 32% (p < 0.05) in the lung tissue (Figs 5 and 6). In addition, the major changes in the methylation levels were associated with the methylation of the internal cytosine at the 5’-CCGG-3’ locus, and thus, no changes in the efficiency of MspI (which is blocked by methylation of exogenous cytosine) were observed in any of the study groups (Fig 6).

Moreover, in the cells of both tissue types in the flight group, F, the relative mRNA contents of genes encoding the methylases Dnmt1 (S-phase methylation) and Dnmt3A (de novo methylation), the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3 (Fig 7A and 7C), the histone aminotransferase Hat1 and the histone deacetylase Hdac1 (Fig 7B and 7D) did not differ from those of the control group. However, the mRNA content of the cytosine demethylase Tet2 decreased by 55% (p < 0.05) in the cardiac tissue (Fig 7A) and 36% (p < 0.05) in the lung tissue (Fig 7C) in the flight group compared to the control group.

The main difficulty is the extrapolation of ground experimental data to the prediction of results under weightlessness conditions. Previous experiments conducted under space flight conditions were limited by the fact that the biomaterial of the flight animals could only be fixed after landing, usually occurring a few hours after the landing [1–7, 13]. Therefore, this experiment is the first in the history of human space exploration with the unique opportunity to fix mouse biomaterial under space flight conditions. Comparing these results with the results obtained after the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 flight of the same length, a number of deductions can be made regarding the structural changes in the cells as a result of the early period of readaptation to Earth’s gravity. Long duration microgravity does not lead to notable changes in cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue The relative contents of beta-actin, gamma-actin, beta-tubulin and desmin both in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cardiac tissue remained at the same level in all the study groups. These data agree with data Tauber S. et al. showed for macrophages, which were also recorded under weightlessness conditions in the ISS (Space-X3 mission). In addition, changes of the cytoskeleton structure after an 11-day spaceflight were not observed [23]. The contents of the actin-binding proteins alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4 in the membrane fraction were also unchanged. However, in the cytoplasmic fraction, alpha-actinin-1 decreased by 40% (p < 0.05), and alpha-actinin-4 decreased by 30% (p < 0.05) in group F compared to group G. The previous data from the 30-day space flight of the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 (2013, Russia) showed that the beta-actin content in the membrane fraction of proteins was at the same level, while in the cytoplasmic fraction, there was a decrease in the beta-actin protein and mRNA expression levels in the flight group [13]. The gamma-actin mRNA and protein contents were unchanged. The alpha-actinin-1 protein content remained unchanged in the post-flight group, while the corresponding mRNA content was higher in the post-flight group than in the control groups. The alpha-actinin-4 protein content in the membrane fraction was reduced by 28% (p < 0.05) in group F compared to the control, although there was not a similar change in the cytoplasmic fraction. At the same time, the corresponding gene expression was reduced by 18% [13]. The principal difference between the RR-1 and BION-M No. 1 experiments is that the biomaterial in the RR-1 experiment was fixed under space flight conditions, and the biomaterial in the BION-M Biosatellite No. 1 experiment was fixed within 13 hours after landing, i.e., there was a brief period of readaptation. In addition, another critical point is the effects of congestion during landing. However, overload during early readaptation is also a sharp increase of the external mechanical load. Earlier, we proposed a model wherein changes of the external mechanical load can lead to the dissociation of actin-binding proteins from the cortical cytoskeleton and the triggering signaling pathways, leading to a change in the expression level of the corresponding genes, which in turn leads to a redistribution of cytoskeletal proteins between the cellular compartments [38]. Comparison of the data obtained from the RR-1 experiment with the data of the BION-M biosatellite experiment (Table 2) suggests that long-term space flight leads to a decrease in the expression levels of alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4 in the cytoplasmic fraction of cardiac proteins. Thirteen hours under Earth’s gravity after a long-term space flight causes a reduction in the beta-actin content in the cytoplasmic fraction of proteins, the recovery of the alpha-actinin-1 content to the reference level and the reallocation of alpha-actinin-4 between the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Table 2. Comparison of the RR-1 experiment with BION-M No.1 experiment (for cardiac tissue).

Cytoskeleton changes, observed in the early period of readaptation, can subsequently affect myocardial function. Summarizing these data, it can be assumed that the early period of readaptation is more damaging than space flight. Therefore, we can suggest that the development of protective measures could possibly focus on preparing for landing. It should be noted that only minor changes in the protein contents in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cardiac tissue were found, and no changes were detected in the lung tissue. Therefore, this finding raises the question of whether the absence of changes in the protein contents was associated with the absence of changes in gene expression and/or changes in translation/proteolysis efficiency. Thus, qRT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA content. For the cardiac tissue, we found no changes in the mRNA contents of genes encoding the isoforms of actin and tubulin (the protein contents were also unchanged). The mRNA content of the alpha-actinin-4 gene was reduced, as was the protein content. At the same time, in the cardiac and lung tissue, there was a decrease of the desmin mRNA content with an absence of the protein content. In addition to the desmin mRNA changes in the lung tissue with an absence of consequent protein content changes, the beta-actin mRNA content was also decreased. This finding suggests an increase of translation efficiency and/or decrease in the efficiency of the proteolysis of these proteins. One possible method is the release of phospholipase D, which leads to an increase in translation efficiency. In turn, phospholipase D associates with alpha-actinin-1, which inhibits their activity [39]. Accordingly, if the formation of the protein pattern in the weightlessness (after short-term duration) passed the stage of the cytoskeleton reorganization (it can be assumed on the basis of a number of model experiments [40, 41, 42]), phospholipase D could be released, leading to the formation of the observed protein pattern after long-term duration in the microgravity conditions. However, in the absence of changes in the alpha-actinin-1 mRNA content, the protein content in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes decreased; in the lung tissue, the alpha-actinin-1 protein content remained at control levels, but the mRNA content increased. Alpha-actinin-1 is a member of the spectrin family [43], which is located along stress-fibrils and connects microfilament bundles [44]. Alpha-actinin-1 (as well as alpha-actinin-4) is a non-muscle isoform of the alpha-actinins, but it is expressed in cardiomyocytes [45] and is able to interact with a large number of signaling molecules and transcriptional factors [46, 47]. The reduction of the alpha-actinin-1 content may occur in the cytoplasmic fraction as a result of its migration into the nucleus. Although we did not detect alpha-actinin-1 in the nucleus, its highly homologous protein alpha-actinin-4 can transfer to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of certain genes [48]. It should be mentioned that procedure of freeze-defrost-freeze for the estimated tissues could lead to decreased protein content. However, we estimated the relative contents of the proteins and mRNA. Because we compared the flight group results with those of the control groups and the procedure for all groups was identical, we can estimate relative changes in the flight group.Total transcriptional efficiency of DNA of mouse cardiac and lung tissue after a long duration space flight The cause of the reduction of the mRNA content of certain genes that encode cytoskeletal proteins remains unclear. The transcription efficiency of eukaryotic promoters, especially in higher animals, is closely related to the level of genome methylation. DNA from mammalian somatic tissue is methylated in 70% of all CpG sites [49]. The key exceptions to this global methylation are the CpG islands, which mark the promoters and 5’- domains of genes [50]. The reported data regarding DNA methylation in rice plants, human T-lymphocyte cells and human lymphoblastoid cells under space flight conditions and the results of modeling experiments suggest that DNA methylation patterns change [32, 33, 34]. Therefore, we decided to estimate the total methylation level in our samples. We showed that methylation in the mouse cardiac and lung tissue shifted to hypermethylation after a 37-day space flight. In addition, these data agreed with the data that Ou X. et al. [32] obtained after space flight. However, the mechanisms underlying the changes of the methylation levels after space flight are currently unknown. The methylation level of the genome increased because heavy ions radiation, which can make a difference in the space flight conditions [51, 52]. In addition, this can contribute to the observed increase in the methylation level in the flight group. However, this contribution is unlikely to be decisive, since this experiment was conducted on board an International Space Station. Animals and humans were in the same compartments, which have both special protection against cosmic radiation and natural protection, since the orbit passes below the Earth's magnetosphere. In general, it is known that that de novo methylation can be mediated by histone deacetylation in the nucleosome area [53–58]. In addition, changes of methylation levels can result from increases in the methylase activity/content. Singh K.P. et al. [33] showed that the expression levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b were increased at 72 h and decreased at 7 days in microgravity-exposed cells, but at the same time, there was decreased expression of HDAC1. The authors suggested that the decreased expression of HDAC1 would result in an increased level of acetylated histone H3; however, a decreased level of acetylated H3 was observed under the microgravity condition, which indicated that other HDACs may be involved in the regulation of H3 deacetylation [33]. Ou X. et al. [32] found that several genes encoding the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler (DDM1) and siRNA-related proteins are extremely sensitive to perturbation by space flight, which may be an underlying cause for the altered methylation patterns in plants subjected to space flight. Therefore, we decided to assess the expression level of genes encoding methylases as well as the basic histone acetylase/deacetylase. The obtained results indicate that the gene expression levels of the histone aminotransferase Hat1, the histone deacetylase Hdac1, and the cytosine methylases Dnmt1 (S-phase methylation) and Dnmt3A (de novo methylation) were unchanged under weightlessness conditions. On the other hand, the methylation level can increase as a result of a reduction of the intensity of active DNA demethylation. Researchers believe that 5 hmC is the intermediate product in the process of active DNA demethylation [59–63] and is generated by Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) protein-mediated oxidative catalysis of 5mC [64]. Therefore, we measured the mRNA content of cytosine demethylases (Tet1, Tet2, Tet3) in the tested tissues. There were no changes in Tet1 and Tet3 mRNA content, but there was a significant decrease Tet2 mRNA content in mouse cardiac and lungs tissues. The data regarding Tet2 contents are quite limited and inconsistent; in TET2-mutated acute myeloid leukemia samples, Ko M. et al. [65] observed DNA hypomethylation, but Figueroa M.E. et al. [66] showed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype. Moreover, Menon M.P. et al. [67] showed that patients with primary central nervous system T-cell lymphomas had tumor cell necrosis as well as mutations of a number of genes, in particular TET2, the products of which are involved in the regulation of transcription efficiency. Thus, in our experiment, we can only assume that the mechanism of the change in total methylation levels in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice was associated with the decrease in the Tet2 mRNA content under space flight conditions.Conclusions Our study, in which murine biomaterial was fixed for the first time under space flight conditions (after 37 days of weightlessness), showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice. At the same time, there were significant changes in the mRNA content, which, on the one hand, indicates changes in translation efficiency and/or proteolysis levels that act to maintain normal levels of proteins and on the other hand, indicates the alteration of the expression levels of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins, perhaps as a result of the total genome methylation increase. The mRNA contents of the DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase were unchanged, and the mRNA content of the cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased, which could cause changes in the total methylation level.Supporting information S1 Table.

    "title": "Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10285634/",
    "abstract": "Summary We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3β content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3β was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. Subject area(s): Musculoskeletal medicine, Space medicine",
    "introduction": "Introduction From the first manned flight into space to sending humans to the surface of the moon, we have gained a better appreciation and understanding of the complexities of space travel. Now in the 21st century, current efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that take humans to Mars for the first time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident. NASA has identified several hazards of human spaceflight including space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures, and microgravity.1 As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to microgravity with spaceflight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth. GSK3 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that has two known isoforms: GSK3α and GSK3β, with the latter being dominant in most tissues. It is a constitutively active enzyme, indicating that it has high protein kinase activity under resting conditions, though it can be inhibited through Ser phosphorylation (Ser21, GSK3α; and Ser9, GSK3β).2 As both isoforms are structurally similar (95% sequence identity in their catalytic domains3), it is not surprising that they also share some functional redundancy, though unique and tissue-specific roles have also been demonstrated.4,5,6,7,8 In general, GSK3 is thought to act as a “brake” in many anabolic pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and insulin signaling pathways.2 In the context of the musculoskeletal system, GSK3 is a well-known negative regulator of both muscle9,10,11,12,13 and bone mass2,10,14,15 that not only slows the anabolic pathways but in many cases can also accelerate the catabolic ones. With its involvement in the regulation of both bone and muscle mass, it is possible that targeting GSK3 could represent a viable mitigation strategy against the musculoskeletal declines seen with spaceflight. Several lines of evidence found here on Earth are in support of this. We have shown that inhibiting GSK3 with lithium can increase myoblast fusion and differentiation10 and promote osteogenic signaling in bones from mice.10 Furthermore, patients being treated with lithium for bipolar disorder have been previously shown to have significantly reduced risk of fracture.16 In addition, an impressive body of work from Dr. Boris Shenkman’s laboratory has shown that GSK3 is more active in muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) – a well-accepted simulated microgravity model – and that its inhibition can attenuate the consequential muscle remodeling (for review readers are referred to ref. 17). Although the evidence from ground-based models suggests that GSK3 may be a viable target against the musculoskeletal decline observed with spaceflight, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have investigated this possibility in space. Moreover, the effects of spaceflight, if any, on muscle and bone GSK3 content/signaling remains unknown. This could be an initial first step in firmly establishing GSK3 inhibition as a potential countermeasure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on murine muscle and bone GSK3 content and activation status. We obtained samples from various missions/payloads where male or female mice were exposed to microgravity for 30–37 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or the BION-M1 biosatellite. In addition to this, we characterized the effects of dual muscle-specific GSK3α/β knockdown on muscle size and strength as well as region-specific (tibia, femur, lumbar spine) bone mineral density (BMD) in response to simulated microgravity via HLS. In doing so, we provide evidence in support of targeting GSK3 to enhance bone and muscle health during spaceflight.",

Fajardo (vfajardo@brocku.ca).Materials availability This study did not generate new unique reagents. Experimental models and subject details Muscle samples from RR1, RR9, RR18, and BION-M1 missions Soleus, EDL, and TA muscle samples were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the RR1, RR9, and RR18 missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. For all missions, we were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the BION-M1 mission, male C57BL/6N (19–20 week old at time of launch) mice were maintained in high-orbit (∼550 km) for 30 days in specialized flight modules.44 For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) and female C57BL/6J (RR1, 16 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats45 on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere for RR1, RR9, and BION-M1.18,19 For the RR18 mission, flight mice were aboard the ISS for 30 days with weekly injections of either sterile saline (0.9%) or the antioxidant metalloporphyrin (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, herein referred to as BuOE). The mice used in this study were part of a live animal return cohort where tissue dissection occurred 1 day after landing. Soleus muscles were collected and stored in RNAlater at −80°C, prior to being homogenized in PMSF buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5)). We did not find any differences in GSK3 content or MHC isoform expression between the two saline and BuOE cohorts, and thus we elected to keep them separate in our analysis. In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018. Thus, differences in GSK3 expression and activation were first examined in R9 cohort controls to determine if a normalizing factor would be required. Importantly, we found no differences in GSK3 phosphorylation in the TA muscles from Cohort Control 1 (CC1) and Cohort Control 2 (CC2) (Figure S12). We also found no significant differences between cohort controls (CC1 vs. CC2) in any of the bone outcomes measured (Table S3).Animals Skeletal muscle-specific Gsk3 partial knockdown mice of a C57BL/6J background were generated by crossing GSK3α/β floxed mice (kindly donated by Dr. Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania) with ACTA-1-Cre mice (Jackson laboratories) under the control of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter.23 Heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice also heterozygously expressing ACTA-1 Cre were considered GSK3mKD, whereas heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice without ACTA-1 Cre were considered the flox control (GSK3flox). For the lithium feeding experiments, male 3–6 month old C57BL/6 mice were used. All mice were fed a standard chow diet (2014 Teklad global, 14% protein rodent maintenance diet, Harlan Teklad, Mississauga, ON), and were kept on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water through the entirety of the study. Mice were housed at a temperature of 22–24°C for the duration of the study.Ethics statement This study utilized murine muscle samples provided to us through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. All animal procedures performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Experimental protocols for the GSK3mKD and lithium feeding experiments were approved by the Brock University Animal Care Committee (files #17-06-03, #20-07-01, and #21-06-02) and were in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Method details Hindlimb suspension For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water. After 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their soleus muscles were collected.Lithium feeding and tenotomy surgery For the lithium feeding study, C57BL/6 male mice (3–6 months of age) were randomly divided into a control or lithium group. The lithium group received a dose of 10 mg/kg/day of LiCl via their drinking water as previously described10,23,25,46 whereas the control group received drinking water without LiCl supplementation. The total duration of treatment was 6 weeks. On the fourth week, all mice underwent the tenotomy surgery as previously described.47,48,49 Briefly, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, prior to severing the soleus and gastrocnemius tendons from one leg. A sham surgery was conducted on the contralateral leg to serve as an internal control. Both wounds on both legs were closed with silk suture and mice were returned to their home cages, where LiCl or control treatment was maintained for an additional two weeks prior to euthanization. After euthanizing the mice via cervical dislocation, soleus muscles were collected for future analyses.DXA scanning of individual bones A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.Soleus muscle contractility Soleus muscle contractility was assessed as previously described25,47 at 25°C using an Aurora Scientific contractile apparatus with a biphasic simulator (model 305B and 701B). Soleus muscles were subjected to a force frequency curve (1, 20, 40, 80 and 160) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.50 For force-frequency analysis, peak isometric force was obtained. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated using the following formula: CSA = m/l∗d∗(Lf/Lo), where m, muscle mass (mg); l, muscle length (mm); d, mammalian skeletal muscle density (1.06 mg/mm3); Lf/Lo is the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio (0.71 for soleus). Specific force was calculated by normalizing peak isometric force by CSA.Western blotting A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). Western blotting was performed to determine GSK3β, phosphorylated (p)-GSK3β, GSK3α, (p)-GSK3α, β catenin, MHC I, MHC IIa, MHC IIx, MHC IIb. Antibodies from pGSK3β (9336), total (t)-GSK3-β (9315), pGSK3α (9316), tGSK3α (4818), β-Catenin (8480) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). MHC I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIx (6H1), and IIb (BF-F3) antibodies as well as the antibodies for Pax7 (AB_528428) and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). The antibodies for FNDC5 and COXIV were obtained from Abcam (ab13190 and abS16056, respectively) and the antibody for PGC-1α was obtained from Millipore (ST1204). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086: BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis. Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min. Following blocking, the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation at 4°C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling Technology; MHC I, IIa, IIx, IIb) or anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3α, GSK3α p-GSK3β, GSK3β, β-catenin) antibody both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation, membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each. Millipore Immobilon (#WBKLSO500) chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection. Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).GSK3 fiber type analysis To assess the fiber type expression of GSK3β, we performed immunofluorescent microscopy experiments on serial 10 μm cryosections obtained from O.C.T. (optimal cutting temperature) embedded soleus and EDL muscles from n = 3 mobile wild-type C57BL/6J male mice. One serial cryosection underwent immunofluorescent fiber type staining as previously described to demarcate the various fiber types with MHC I, IIa, IIx, and IIb isoforms.30,47 The other serial cryosection underwent immunofluorescent staining with a primary antibody for GSK3β (9315, Cell Signaling, 1:2500 dilution) and an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescent secondary antibody (A27040, ThermoFisher Scientific, 1:5000 dilution). Once fiber types were identified with MHC isoform expression/fluorescence, GSK3β was quantified by converting the image to grayscale and quantifying the mean gray value with ImageJ. Within a single muscle, 10 of each fiber type were randomly analyzed.Histological analysis Soleus muscles embedded in O.C.T. matrix from GSK3mKD and GSK3flox HLS mice were processed into 10 μm cryosections prior to undergoing H&E staining. For each muscle, 2–3 images were randomly taken and the CSA of 20 fibers per mouse (n = 3–4 per group) were obtained using ImageJ. For central nuclei counts, the total number of fibers from the H&E images were counted, ranging from 150 to 230 fibers per image and the number of fibers with central nuclei calculated as a percent of the total number of fibers within the image.Micro-computed tomography bone imaging Micro-computed tomography (μCT, SkyScan 1176 V.1.1 build 12, Bruker microCT, Belgium) was performed as previously described.51 Following euthanasia, the right tibia was excised, cleaned of surrounding tissue, and wrapped in parafilm wax to prevent moisture loss throughout the duration of the 180-degree high resolution (9 μm) scan. A 0.25 mm aluminum filter was applied. The beam strength was set at 45 kV and 545 μA for an exposure time of 850 ms. Resulting images were reconstructed (smoothing kernel = 2, ring artifact reduction = 8, beam hardening = 30%, and dynamic image range = 0.000–0.155; NRecon V.1.7.3.1 software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) into 3D images and reoriented in anatomical position (DataViewer V.1.5.6.2 64-bit software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) for consistency when selecting the regions of interest. Quantification of trabecular and cortical bone structure outcomes was performed at the proximal tibia and tibia midpoint, respectively.Assessment of trabecular bone structure at the proximal tibia Trabecular bone region of interest began 0.855 mm from the point in which the primary spongiosa disconnects and formation of the growth plate is evident and expanded 0.675 mm toward the tibia midpoint. Trabecular bone was manually delineated from the cortical bone and quantified using an adaptive thresholding of 49 to determine total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, trabecular number, degree of anisotropy, and connectivity density.Assessment of cortical bone structure at the tibia midpoint For cortical bone structure analysis, the tibia midpoint was used to define the region of interest (0.450 mm toward the proximal and distal ends; total height of 0.900 mm). Cortical bone structure outcomes, including total cross-sectional area, cortical area, cortical area fraction, cortical thickness, periosteal perimeter, endocortical perimeter, medullary area, and eccentricity, were calculated using an adaptive threshold of 67. Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical analyses To examine the combined effect of spaceflight on GSK3 content and phosphorylation, fold-change values were calculated for each mission relative to the average of both GC and VIV controls. The fold-change values were compared with GCVIV controls using a Student’s t test. For the western blot data across the individual experiments (Figures S1–S3, S5, and S6), a one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunnet’s post-hoc test was used to strictly compare GC vs. Flight and VIV vs. Flight. This method was chosen since no significant differences between GC and VIV for any outcome measure related to muscle were detected for any mission. Similarly, for the bone analysis (DXA, μCT, and western blot analyses) GC and VIV controls were combined as there were no differences between the two groups. This was done to increase statistical power. A Student’s t test was then used to make comparisons between F and GCVIV. For the GSK3mKD experiments, most comparisons were made Student’s t test unless otherwise stated where a two-way ANOVA was used. For the lithium and tenotomy experiments, a two-way ANOVA was also used to test the main effects of lithium treatment and tenotomy. All data are presented as mean +/− standard error unless stated otherwise. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality for both studies. Statistical tests were conducted through GraphPad Prism 8 Software. Any statistical outliers detected using the ROUT test (Q = 5%) on GraphPad Prism were removed prior to analysis. A p ≤ 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.",
    "results": "Results GSK3β content is reduced in muscles from spacefaring mice Soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle samples from the flight (F), ground control (GC), and vivarium control (VIV) groups were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the rodent research 1 (RR1), RR9, and RR18 (BuOE and saline-treated) missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. Absolute muscle mass data for the RR9 (soleus and TA) and RR1 (soleus) missions were reported in a recent study published by our group showing significant muscle atrophy.18 Muscle mass data for the BION-M1 (soleus and EDL) mission were also reported previously where although both soleus and EDL muscles appeared to be smaller in the F group, there were no significant differences when compared with GC or VIV.19 Muscle mass data for RR18 are reported here in Table S1. We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation, and although there was no effect of spaceflight in the EDL or TA, we found significant differences in the soleus - a postural muscle that is most affected by microgravity exposure (Figures S1–S7). To summarize the soleus data, we examined the fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups (Figure 1). Across all missions, we observed significant reductions in total GSK3β content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined reduction of 36% (Figure 1A). When examining the overall effect of spaceflight on Ser9 phosphorylated GSK3β content, we found a combined 1.2-fold increase in phosphorylation, however, this was only statistically significant for the BION-M1 and RR18 saline cohorts. Unlike GSK3β content, we did not find a consistent reduction in GSK3α across all missions (Figure 1C). Similarly, we found no combined effect of spaceflight on Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α (Figure 1D). Altogether, these findings suggest that spaceflight more prominently affects the GSK3β isoform by reducing its protein levels and, though not consistent for all missions, by also increasing its Ser9 phosphorylation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The combined effect of spaceflight across all missions on GSK3 content, phosphorylation status and MHC isoform content in soleus muscles (A) Total GSK3β content. (B) Phosphorylated GSK3β (Ser9) relative to total GSK3β content. (C) Total GSK3α content. (D) Phosphorylated GSK3α (Ser21) relative to total GSK3β content. (E) MHC I content. (F) MHC IIa content. (G) MHC IIx content. (H) MHC IIb content. Fold-change (FC) data were calculated for each mission by dividing the Flight group by the average of the combined GC and VIV groups. The combined dataset represents the mean ± SEM and p value (Student’s t test) for all FC data (RR1, RR9, RR18, and BION-M1).To help explain why GSK3β was lower in soleus muscles after spaceflight, we followed up on our previous findings showing that the fast-twitch EDL muscle has lower GSK3β content compared with the slow-twitch soleus.13 We posited that the reduction in GSK3β found with spaceflight would be largely attributed to the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that occurs within the murine soleus.19,20,21,22 Across all missions analyzed, there were signs of a slow-to-fast fiber type shift in the soleus after spaceflight with an average 30% and 61% reduction in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa, respectively (Figures 1E, 1F, S8, and S9). Conversely, we found an average 4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in MHC IIx and IIb isoforms, respectively, in the soleus after spaceflight (Figures 1G, 1H, S8, and S9). The reduction in type IIa is of particular interest as our immunofluorescent microscopy experiments indicate that in the soleus and EDL muscles from otherwise healthy mice (e.g., mobile control), GSK3β is most abundant in the type IIA fibers that are identified with MHC IIa (Figure 2). Thus, the reduction in type IIA fibers found with spaceflight likely accounts for the reduction in GSK3β protein observed with spaceflight. Figure 2.

Scale bars are set to 200 μm. Muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increases soleus muscle size and strength under simulated microgravity conditions The reduction in GSK3β observed after spaceflight in the murine soleus could suggest that GSK3 has only a minimal role in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness. However, given that our analyses of GSK3 content was conducted in muscle samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight, we next wanted to determine the effects of GSK3 inhibition before microgravity-induced muscle unloading, and more importantly, before any change in fiber type distribution that would result in lowered GSK3β content. To this end, we employed the NASA developed HLS model to simulate microgravity exposure on Earth. To inhibit GSK3, we used a muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown (GSK3mKD) mouse model previously generated in our lab.23 These mice display partial knockdown (-40-50%) of both GSK3 isoforms in the soleus (Figure S10). In turn, these mice have significantly larger soleus muscles - both in absolute and relative to body mass terms (Figure S10). Furthermore, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans show that these mice have lowered body fat % and increased lean mass % (Figure S10). After 7 days of HLS, GSK3mKD mice still had lowered % fat mass, elevated % lean mass, and increased soleus:body mass ratio when compared with GSK3flox mice (Figures 3A–3E). However, although GSK3mKD mice had larger soleus muscles after HLS (Figure 3), normalizing the data to mobile controls demonstrated that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS as both GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice experienced a ∼50–60% reduction in absolute soleus mass and a ∼40–50% reduction in normalized soleus mass (Figures 3F and 3G). Nonetheless, soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice were still larger when compared to GSK3flox HLS mice, which was further supported by H&E analysis and a rightward shift in fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution (Figures 3H and 3I). Upon closer inspection, we also found that the GSK3mKD HLS mice had a greater proportion of fibers with centrally located nuclei (Figure 3J), which is indicative of enhanced myogenic repair. Corroborating these findings, myogenic markers Pax7 and myogenin were significantly greater in HLS soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice versus GSK3flox mice (Figure 3K). Furthermore, we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice also had greater MHC IIa, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) protein levels versus GSK3mKD HLS mice (Figure 3L). With a significant reduction in MHC IIx (Figure 3L), these results provide evidence for an oxidative fiber type shift with muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown, which is consistent with our previous findings in mice treated with various pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors.24,25 In terms of soleus muscle strength, we found that after HLS, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production across submaximal and maximal frequencies (Figure 3M). This effect was not found in a mobile state (Figure 3N), and therefore, calculating the percent reduction in specific force (HLS mice relative to their respective mobile controls), we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice had significantly greater preservation (e.g. lower % reduction) of force across submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies (Figure 3O). Altogether, these results show that targeted GSK3 inhibition before muscle unloading can increase soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and the oxidative fiber type while also preserving muscle strength.

Characterizing GSK3 activation in bones after spaceflight and the effects of muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown on femur, tibia, and lumbar bone mineral density We then investigated the effects of microgravity exposure on GSK3β content and phosphorylation in femur bones obtained from the RR9 mission. As expected, DXA scan analysis of the femurs showed significantly reduced bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the F group compared with the combined GCVIV control (Figures 4A and 4B). Additional micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of the tibia from these same mice demonstrated decrements in bone structure were apparent in the cortical bone outcomes, whereas no differences in trabecular bone outcomes were evident (Table S2). Specifically, flight mice presented lower cortical area fraction and periosteal perimeter, which was aligned with lower cortical thickness, compared to GCVIV control mice. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in the pGSK3β in the femur compared with GCVIV with no changes in total GSK3β content (Figures 4C–4E). This in turn led to a reduction in the phosphorylation status of GSK3β, and though it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4F), it is perhaps indicative of greater GSK3β activation in murine bones after spaceflight.

For (A–F), GC and VIV controls were combined to increase statistical power. All values are presented as means ± SEM.Using the DXA scans from the GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mobile and HLS mice, we then performed bone-specific regional BMD analysis on the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine to determine whether muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could provide positive effects on BMD crosstalk (Figure 4H). In the mobile state, we did not find any differences in region-specific BMD between GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice (Figures 4G and 4H). However, after 7 days of HLS, we found that tibia BMD was greater in GSK3mKD HLS mice versus GSK3flox HLS mice (Figure 4I). A similar result was found in the lumbar spine; albeit, this was not statistically significant (Figure 4I). In terms of tissue crosstalk, we examined the effects of muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown on soleus muscle fibronectin type III domain-containing protein (FNDC5), which is the precursor for the myokine irisin that gets secreted out into circulation with exercise and activation of PGC-1α in muscle.26 Irisin produced and secreted from muscle can promote bone strength and mass in mice; and has been shown to limit bone loss associated with HLS.27,28 Here, we demonstrate that the increase in region-specific BMD found with GSK3mKD was associated with a significant increase in FNDC5 in the soleus (Figure 4J). Though our study is limited in that we did not collect serum to measure irisin levels, we think it is possible that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could positively impact BMD (particularly in the tibia and lumbar spine) by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5 in muscle (Figure 4K).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we questioned whether GSK3 would be a viable therapeutic target that when inhibited could prevent or limit the muscle and bone loss associated with spaceflight. To this end, we first examined the effects of at least 30 days of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation status in murine muscle and bone samples. We then supplemented this work with Earth-based HLS experiments in GSK3mKD mice where we assessed muscle size and strength with region-specific BMD. In the postural soleus muscle, we found that GSK3β but not GSK3α was consistently and significantly reduced in the F group compared with GCVIV, which is in line with previous proteomics analysis from the BION-M1 mission (see Tables S1 and S4 from ref. 19) and indicates that the two isoforms may be differentially regulated during spaceflight. Indeed, these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by separate genes located on two different chromosomes (Gsk3α, mouse chromosome 7; and Gsk3β, mouse chromosome 18). Furthermore, inhibitory Ser phosphorylation was only enhanced with the GSK3β isoform after spaceflight; albeit not consistently across all missions, whereas Ser phosphorylation of GSK3α was virtually unaltered, which again indicates the two GSK3 isoforms are differentially regulated with spaceflight. Although the observed reduction in GSK3β content and its increase in inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation in the soleus may argue against its involvement in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness found with muscle unloading and spaceflight, it may just reflect the slow-to-fast fiber type shift, namely a reduction in type IIA fibers which we have shown are particularly enriched with GSK3β. This is consistent with our previous findings showing that GSK3β is highly expressed in the soleus versus the EDL29 as the soleus comprises nearly 50% IIA fibers versus the EDL, which only comprises 10% type IIA fibers.30 Moreover, we previously found greater Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in the EDL versus the soleus.29 Alternatively, or perhaps congruently, it is also possible that these changes in GSK3β content and activation may point toward an adaptive/compensatory response aimed at limiting GSK3 activation to limit muscle atrophy and weakness. Providing additional GSK3 inhibition, preferably before the onset of muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type changes may then preserve muscle health and function during spaceflight. To establish whether GSK3 inhibition could potentially preserve muscle size and strength in response to microgravity exposure, we utilized the simulated microgravity HLS model. Our results show that muscle-specific genetic reduction before muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type shift increased soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength in the face of HLS. We elected to partially knockdown (-40-50%) both GSK3 isoforms despite the fact that only GSK3β was affected by spaceflight to limit any potential compensatory activation of GSK3α. In a previous study by Pansters et al., sole genetic deletion of Gsk3β appeared to have upregulated protein levels of GSK3α in the murine soleus.31 In this study, the authors found that genetic knockdown of Gsk3β did not attenuate soleus muscle atrophy in response to HLS, however, they did find an acceleration in muscle recovery with reloading.31 These findings are consistent with our present results showing that although muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased soleus muscle size, it did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS, but it did enhance myogenic signaling. Moreover, our findings extend those from Pansters et al. because they did not examine soleus muscle contractile force. In this respect, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production versus GSK3flox mice but only after 7 days of HLS and not in the mobile state. This suggests that the effect of GSK3mKD on muscle strength only manifests after an added stress such as HLS; and it further suggests that in the face of HLS, GSK3mKD mice exhibit a preservation of muscle force production that could be important for spaceflight. The increase in myogenic signaling observed with GSK3mKD mice is also highly relevant to spaceflight. Though HLS is considered to be the Earth-based analog of spaceflight, the mechanisms behind the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness with HLS versus actual spaceflight differ in many respects and there is actually very little overlap.32 However, one common pathway that is negatively affected in both HLS and spaceflight is myogenesis.32 Thus, the observed increase in myogenic signaling in GSK3mKD HLS mice could potentially be translated to spaceflight; however, future studies that investigate the effects of spaceflight directly on these mice are required if not warranted. The GSK3mKD HLS mice also displayed a promotion toward the oxidative phenotype with a significant increase in MHC IIa, PGC-1α, and COXIV. This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3 not only attenuates muscle atrophy and weakness but may also attenuate the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that could lead to decrements in muscle performance and fatigue resistance. These results are not entirely surprising given that we and others have shown that GSK3 inhibition in muscle can promote the oxidative fiber type and PGC-1α content.24,25,33,34,35,36 Moreover, the increase in PGC-1α content in muscle can provide benefits outside of muscle by promoting the expression, production, and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin is a myokine secreted from muscle that can positively impact bone mass and strength even in the face of HLS.27,28,37 Specifically, genetic deletion of irisin in mice severely compromises bone strength and mass with an increased number of osteoclasts,27 whereas, irisin treatment prevented bone loss with HLS and accelerated bone recovery in response to reloading in mice.28 Here, we show that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5 in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and in the lumbar spine (though not statistically significant in the latter, p = 0.08). Combined with our results showing that GSK3β is overactive in bones (e.g., less inhibitory Ser phosphorylation) from obtained mice subjected to spaceflight, our study provides ample evidence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for the promotion of musculoskeletal health during spaceflight. In human astronauts, the inhibition of GSK3 before and during spaceflight could be achieved with pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug. It is most commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, because Li also exerts adverse effects when taken at relatively high doses (serum [Li] concentration exceeding 1.0 mM) for a prolonged period of time, it must be prescribed within a narrow therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 mM serum concentration) (for review see ref. 38). Conversely, we have shown that treating mice with lower doses of Li (serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) increases soleus and EDL muscle specific force production while also promoting PGC-1α and the oxidative fiber type.25 In cell culture, we have also shown that low dose Li supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and fusion,29 which could have implications for spaceflight. In fact, pre-treating mice with a low dose of Li (10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) for 4 weeks before unloading the soleus muscle via tenotomy, inhibited GSK3 and increased soleus muscle size even in the face of tenotomy surgery (Figure S10). In addition to muscle, Li has been shown to have osteoprotective effects.2,10,14,15,16 In a recent and large epidemiological study, it was found that patients living with bipolar disorder and receiving Li treatment had reduced risk of developing osteoporosis.39 This is consistent with our findings in mice whereby low dose Li supplementation augmented osteogenic signaling by inhibiting GSK3, which in turn activated the anabolic Wnt/β-catenin pathway.10 It should be noted that Li has several osteoprotective effects acting on other pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) transduction pathways (for review see40). Altogether, the results from our study warrant future investigations with spaceflight and/or HLS to examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 before and during microgravity exposure to further establish whether targeting GSK3 can exert musculoskeletal protection against spaceflight. Undoubtedly, other GSK3 inhibitors aside from Li that are more specific to GSK3 would be important to test and could include drugs like tideglusib, which is the most clinically advanced GSK3 inhibitor currently being tested for other diseases and conditions.41,42 We have recently shown that tideglusib treatment can preserve muscle size, strength, and quality in dystrophic mice.24 The limitations of our study include low sample size, particularly with the RR1 and BION-M1 missions. Although the RR1 mission was conducted in female mice, the limitation in sample size prevented us from truly examining any potential influence of biological sex. Future studies, with age-matched male and female mice, preferably part of the same mission, are required to better elucidate the potential sex-specific effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system. Our study was also limited in that we were not able to obtain bone samples from all missions, and thus our analysis was restricted to the RR9 mission. Within this mission, μCT analyses of the tibia indicated that cortical bone was primarily affected by spaceflight. However, we suspect that limitations in sample size prevented us from detecting a statistically significant effect on trabecular bone. Indeed, previous μCT analyses in the lumbar vertebrae and femur from the BION-M1 mission showed significant reductions in trabecular bone outcomes in the F group versus GC and VIV controls.43 In muscle, where we obtained samples from RR9, RR1, RR18, and BION-M1 missions, we utilized a “meta-analytical” approach with the fold-change response as the common measure of effect size. However, differences in experimental conditions (i.e., food, temperature, pressure, strain differences, age differences, and etc.) should not be discounted. These differences could have contributed to the differences in phosphorylation status of GSK3, where we found significant increases in Ser phosphorylation of GSK3 in BION-M1 and RR18 F soleus muscles but not in any other soleus muscles from RR1 or RR9. Finally, our study is limited in that we did not assess the effects of bone-specific Gsk3 deletion on BMD and strength in response to HLS. Future studies should generate these mice and perform these experiments to firmly establish whether GSK3 inhibition before simulated microgravity exposure can protect against bone loss. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that inhibiting GSK3 specifically in muscle may exert positive effects on the bone thereby highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with whole-body GSK3 inhibition afforded through pharmacological means. In summary, our study shows that GSK3 content and activation status are altered in murine soleus and bone samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight. Although GSK3β content was reduced after spaceflight, our results with the simulated microgravity HLS model shows that inhibiting GSK3 before muscle unloading via muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion can increase muscle mass, myogenic signaling, and can preserve muscle force production. Moreover, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion may also help to maintain bone mass by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5; and thus, future studies aboard the ISS are warranted to examine whether these mice are protected against spaceflight-induced declines in musculoskeletal health. In addition, future studies that examine the effects of pharmacological, and thus, whole-body GSK3 inhibition before and during spaceflight should also be done in mice. Collectively, our present study represents an important first step in hopes of enabling longer duration spaceflight missions to Mars – possibly through GSK3 inhibition.",

Copyright notice ID: 10285634 PMID: 37360691 Summary We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3β content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3β was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight.

Now in the 21st century, current efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that take humans to Mars for the first time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident. NASA has identified several hazards of human spaceflight including space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures, and microgravity.1 As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to microgravity with spaceflight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth. GSK3 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that has two known isoforms: GSK3α and GSK3β, with the latter being dominant in most tissues. It is a constitutively active enzyme, indicating that it has high protein kinase activity under resting conditions, though it can be inhibited through Ser phosphorylation (Ser21, GSK3α; and Ser9, GSK3β).2 As both isoforms are structurally similar (95% sequence identity in their catalytic domains3), it is not surprising that they also share some functional redundancy, though unique and tissue-specific roles have also been demonstrated.4,5,6,7,8 In general, GSK3 is thought to act as a “brake” in many anabolic pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and insulin signaling pathways.2 In the context of the musculoskeletal system, GSK3 is a well-known negative regulator of both muscle9,10,11,12,13 and bone mass2,10,14,15 that not only slows the anabolic pathways but in many cases can also accelerate the catabolic ones. With its involvement in the regulation of both bone and muscle mass, it is possible that targeting GSK3 could represent a viable mitigation strategy against the musculoskeletal declines seen with spaceflight. Several lines of evidence found here on Earth are in support of this. We have shown that inhibiting GSK3 with lithium can increase myoblast fusion and differentiation10 and promote osteogenic signaling in bones from mice.10 Furthermore, patients being treated with lithium for bipolar disorder have been previously shown to have significantly reduced risk of fracture.16 In addition, an impressive body of work from Dr. Boris Shenkman’s laboratory has shown that GSK3 is more active in muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) – a well-accepted simulated microgravity model – and that its inhibition can attenuate the consequential muscle remodeling (for review readers are referred to ref. 17). Although the evidence from ground-based models suggests that GSK3 may be a viable target against the musculoskeletal decline observed with spaceflight, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have investigated this possibility in space. Moreover, the effects of spaceflight, if any, on muscle and bone GSK3 content/signaling remains unknown. This could be an initial first step in firmly establishing GSK3 inhibition as a potential countermeasure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on murine muscle and bone GSK3 content and activation status. We obtained samples from various missions/payloads where male or female mice were exposed to microgravity for 30–37 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or the BION-M1 biosatellite. In addition to this, we characterized the effects of dual muscle-specific GSK3α/β knockdown on muscle size and strength as well as region-specific (tibia, femur, lumbar spine) bone mineral density (BMD) in response to simulated microgravity via HLS. In doing so, we provide evidence in support of targeting GSK3 to enhance bone and muscle health during spaceflight.Results GSK3β content is reduced in muscles from spacefaring mice Soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle samples from the flight (F), ground control (GC), and vivarium control (VIV) groups were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the rodent research 1 (RR1), RR9, and RR18 (BuOE and saline-treated) missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. Absolute muscle mass data for the RR9 (soleus and TA) and RR1 (soleus) missions were reported in a recent study published by our group showing significant muscle atrophy.18 Muscle mass data for the BION-M1 (soleus and EDL) mission were also reported previously where although both soleus and EDL muscles appeared to be smaller in the F group, there were no significant differences when compared with GC or VIV.19 Muscle mass data for RR18 are reported here in Table S1. We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation, and although there was no effect of spaceflight in the EDL or TA, we found significant differences in the soleus - a postural muscle that is most affected by microgravity exposure (Figures S1–S7). To summarize the soleus data, we examined the fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups (Figure 1). Across all missions, we observed significant reductions in total GSK3β content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined reduction of 36% (Figure 1A). When examining the overall effect of spaceflight on Ser9 phosphorylated GSK3β content, we found a combined 1.2-fold increase in phosphorylation, however, this was only statistically significant for the BION-M1 and RR18 saline cohorts. Unlike GSK3β content, we did not find a consistent reduction in GSK3α across all missions (Figure 1C). Similarly, we found no combined effect of spaceflight on Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α (Figure 1D). Altogether, these findings suggest that spaceflight more prominently affects the GSK3β isoform by reducing its protein levels and, though not consistent for all missions, by also increasing its Ser9 phosphorylation.

The combined dataset represents the mean ± SEM and p value (Student’s t test) for all FC data (RR1, RR9, RR18, and BION-M1).To help explain why GSK3β was lower in soleus muscles after spaceflight, we followed up on our previous findings showing that the fast-twitch EDL muscle has lower GSK3β content compared with the slow-twitch soleus.13 We posited that the reduction in GSK3β found with spaceflight would be largely attributed to the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that occurs within the murine soleus.19,20,21,22 Across all missions analyzed, there were signs of a slow-to-fast fiber type shift in the soleus after spaceflight with an average 30% and 61% reduction in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa, respectively (Figures 1E, 1F, S8, and S9). Conversely, we found an average 4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in MHC IIx and IIb isoforms, respectively, in the soleus after spaceflight (Figures 1G, 1H, S8, and S9). The reduction in type IIa is of particular interest as our immunofluorescent microscopy experiments indicate that in the soleus and EDL muscles from otherwise healthy mice (e.g., mobile control), GSK3β is most abundant in the type IIA fibers that are identified with MHC IIa (Figure 2). Thus, the reduction in type IIA fibers found with spaceflight likely accounts for the reduction in GSK3β protein observed with spaceflight. Figure 2.

Scale bars are set to 200 μm.Muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increases soleus muscle size and strength under simulated microgravity conditions The reduction in GSK3β observed after spaceflight in the murine soleus could suggest that GSK3 has only a minimal role in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness. However, given that our analyses of GSK3 content was conducted in muscle samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight, we next wanted to determine the effects of GSK3 inhibition before microgravity-induced muscle unloading, and more importantly, before any change in fiber type distribution that would result in lowered GSK3β content. To this end, we employed the NASA developed HLS model to simulate microgravity exposure on Earth. To inhibit GSK3, we used a muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown (GSK3mKD) mouse model previously generated in our lab.23 These mice display partial knockdown (-40-50%) of both GSK3 isoforms in the soleus (Figure S10). In turn, these mice have significantly larger soleus muscles - both in absolute and relative to body mass terms (Figure S10). Furthermore, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans show that these mice have lowered body fat % and increased lean mass % (Figure S10). After 7 days of HLS, GSK3mKD mice still had lowered % fat mass, elevated % lean mass, and increased soleus:body mass ratio when compared with GSK3flox mice (Figures 3A–3E). However, although GSK3mKD mice had larger soleus muscles after HLS (Figure 3), normalizing the data to mobile controls demonstrated that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS as both GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice experienced a ∼50–60% reduction in absolute soleus mass and a ∼40–50% reduction in normalized soleus mass (Figures 3F and 3G). Nonetheless, soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice were still larger when compared to GSK3flox HLS mice, which was further supported by H&E analysis and a rightward shift in fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution (Figures 3H and 3I). Upon closer inspection, we also found that the GSK3mKD HLS mice had a greater proportion of fibers with centrally located nuclei (Figure 3J), which is indicative of enhanced myogenic repair. Corroborating these findings, myogenic markers Pax7 and myogenin were significantly greater in HLS soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice versus GSK3flox mice (Figure 3K). Furthermore, we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice also had greater MHC IIa, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) protein levels versus GSK3mKD HLS mice (Figure 3L). With a significant reduction in MHC IIx (Figure 3L), these results provide evidence for an oxidative fiber type shift with muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown, which is consistent with our previous findings in mice treated with various pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors.24,25 In terms of soleus muscle strength, we found that after HLS, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production across submaximal and maximal frequencies (Figure 3M). This effect was not found in a mobile state (Figure 3N), and therefore, calculating the percent reduction in specific force (HLS mice relative to their respective mobile controls), we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice had significantly greater preservation (e.g. lower % reduction) of force across submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies (Figure 3O). Altogether, these results show that targeted GSK3 inhibition before muscle unloading can increase soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and the oxidative fiber type while also preserving muscle strength.

Data are presented as means ± SEM.Characterizing GSK3 activation in bones after spaceflight and the effects of muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown on femur, tibia, and lumbar bone mineral density We then investigated the effects of microgravity exposure on GSK3β content and phosphorylation in femur bones obtained from the RR9 mission. As expected, DXA scan analysis of the femurs showed significantly reduced bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the F group compared with the combined GCVIV control (Figures 4A and 4B). Additional micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of the tibia from these same mice demonstrated decrements in bone structure were apparent in the cortical bone outcomes, whereas no differences in trabecular bone outcomes were evident (Table S2). Specifically, flight mice presented lower cortical area fraction and periosteal perimeter, which was aligned with lower cortical thickness, compared to GCVIV control mice. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in the pGSK3β in the femur compared with GCVIV with no changes in total GSK3β content (Figures 4C–4E). This in turn led to a reduction in the phosphorylation status of GSK3β, and though it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4F), it is perhaps indicative of greater GSK3β activation in murine bones after spaceflight. Figure 4.

For (A–F), GC and VIV controls were combined to increase statistical power. All values are presented as means ± SEM.Using the DXA scans from the GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mobile and HLS mice, we then performed bone-specific regional BMD analysis on the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine to determine whether muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could provide positive effects on BMD crosstalk (Figure 4H). In the mobile state, we did not find any differences in region-specific BMD between GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice (Figures 4G and 4H). However, after 7 days of HLS, we found that tibia BMD was greater in GSK3mKD HLS mice versus GSK3flox HLS mice (Figure 4I). A similar result was found in the lumbar spine; albeit, this was not statistically significant (Figure 4I). In terms of tissue crosstalk, we examined the effects of muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown on soleus muscle fibronectin type III domain-containing protein (FNDC5), which is the precursor for the myokine irisin that gets secreted out into circulation with exercise and activation of PGC-1α in muscle.26 Irisin produced and secreted from muscle can promote bone strength and mass in mice; and has been shown to limit bone loss associated with HLS.27,28 Here, we demonstrate that the increase in region-specific BMD found with GSK3mKD was associated with a significant increase in FNDC5 in the soleus (Figure 4J). Though our study is limited in that we did not collect serum to measure irisin levels, we think it is possible that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could positively impact BMD (particularly in the tibia and lumbar spine) by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5 in muscle (Figure 4K).Discussion Here, we questioned whether GSK3 would be a viable therapeutic target that when inhibited could prevent or limit the muscle and bone loss associated with spaceflight. To this end, we first examined the effects of at least 30 days of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation status in murine muscle and bone samples. We then supplemented this work with Earth-based HLS experiments in GSK3mKD mice where we assessed muscle size and strength with region-specific BMD. In the postural soleus muscle, we found that GSK3β but not GSK3α was consistently and significantly reduced in the F group compared with GCVIV, which is in line with previous proteomics analysis from the BION-M1 mission (see Tables S1 and S4 from ref. 19) and indicates that the two isoforms may be differentially regulated during spaceflight. Indeed, these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by separate genes located on two different chromosomes (Gsk3α, mouse chromosome 7; and Gsk3β, mouse chromosome 18). Furthermore, inhibitory Ser phosphorylation was only enhanced with the GSK3β isoform after spaceflight; albeit not consistently across all missions, whereas Ser phosphorylation of GSK3α was virtually unaltered, which again indicates the two GSK3 isoforms are differentially regulated with spaceflight. Although the observed reduction in GSK3β content and its increase in inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation in the soleus may argue against its involvement in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness found with muscle unloading and spaceflight, it may just reflect the slow-to-fast fiber type shift, namely a reduction in type IIA fibers which we have shown are particularly enriched with GSK3β. This is consistent with our previous findings showing that GSK3β is highly expressed in the soleus versus the EDL29 as the soleus comprises nearly 50% IIA fibers versus the EDL, which only comprises 10% type IIA fibers.30 Moreover, we previously found greater Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in the EDL versus the soleus.29 Alternatively, or perhaps congruently, it is also possible that these changes in GSK3β content and activation may point toward an adaptive/compensatory response aimed at limiting GSK3 activation to limit muscle atrophy and weakness. Providing additional GSK3 inhibition, preferably before the onset of muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type changes may then preserve muscle health and function during spaceflight. To establish whether GSK3 inhibition could potentially preserve muscle size and strength in response to microgravity exposure, we utilized the simulated microgravity HLS model. Our results show that muscle-specific genetic reduction before muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type shift increased soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength in the face of HLS. We elected to partially knockdown (-40-50%) both GSK3 isoforms despite the fact that only GSK3β was affected by spaceflight to limit any potential compensatory activation of GSK3α. In a previous study by Pansters et al., sole genetic deletion of Gsk3β appeared to have upregulated protein levels of GSK3α in the murine soleus.31 In this study, the authors found that genetic knockdown of Gsk3β did not attenuate soleus muscle atrophy in response to HLS, however, they did find an acceleration in muscle recovery with reloading.31 These findings are consistent with our present results showing that although muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased soleus muscle size, it did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS, but it did enhance myogenic signaling. Moreover, our findings extend those from Pansters et al. because they did not examine soleus muscle contractile force. In this respect, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production versus GSK3flox mice but only after 7 days of HLS and not in the mobile state. This suggests that the effect of GSK3mKD on muscle strength only manifests after an added stress such as HLS; and it further suggests that in the face of HLS, GSK3mKD mice exhibit a preservation of muscle force production that could be important for spaceflight. The increase in myogenic signaling observed with GSK3mKD mice is also highly relevant to spaceflight. Though HLS is considered to be the Earth-based analog of spaceflight, the mechanisms behind the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness with HLS versus actual spaceflight differ in many respects and there is actually very little overlap.32 However, one common pathway that is negatively affected in both HLS and spaceflight is myogenesis.32 Thus, the observed increase in myogenic signaling in GSK3mKD HLS mice could potentially be translated to spaceflight; however, future studies that investigate the effects of spaceflight directly on these mice are required if not warranted. The GSK3mKD HLS mice also displayed a promotion toward the oxidative phenotype with a significant increase in MHC IIa, PGC-1α, and COXIV. This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3 not only attenuates muscle atrophy and weakness but may also attenuate the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that could lead to decrements in muscle performance and fatigue resistance. These results are not entirely surprising given that we and others have shown that GSK3 inhibition in muscle can promote the oxidative fiber type and PGC-1α content.24,25,33,34,35,36 Moreover, the increase in PGC-1α content in muscle can provide benefits outside of muscle by promoting the expression, production, and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin is a myokine secreted from muscle that can positively impact bone mass and strength even in the face of HLS.27,28,37 Specifically, genetic deletion of irisin in mice severely compromises bone strength and mass with an increased number of osteoclasts,27 whereas, irisin treatment prevented bone loss with HLS and accelerated bone recovery in response to reloading in mice.28 Here, we show that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5 in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and in the lumbar spine (though not statistically significant in the latter, p = 0.08). Combined with our results showing that GSK3β is overactive in bones (e.g., less inhibitory Ser phosphorylation) from obtained mice subjected to spaceflight, our study provides ample evidence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for the promotion of musculoskeletal health during spaceflight. In human astronauts, the inhibition of GSK3 before and during spaceflight could be achieved with pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug. It is most commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, because Li also exerts adverse effects when taken at relatively high doses (serum [Li] concentration exceeding 1.0 mM) for a prolonged period of time, it must be prescribed within a narrow therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 mM serum concentration) (for review see ref. 38). Conversely, we have shown that treating mice with lower doses of Li (serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) increases soleus and EDL muscle specific force production while also promoting PGC-1α and the oxidative fiber type.25 In cell culture, we have also shown that low dose Li supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and fusion,29 which could have implications for spaceflight. In fact, pre-treating mice with a low dose of Li (10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) for 4 weeks before unloading the soleus muscle via tenotomy, inhibited GSK3 and increased soleus muscle size even in the face of tenotomy surgery (Figure S10). In addition to muscle, Li has been shown to have osteoprotective effects.2,10,14,15,16 In a recent and large epidemiological study, it was found that patients living with bipolar disorder and receiving Li treatment had reduced risk of developing osteoporosis.39 This is consistent with our findings in mice whereby low dose Li supplementation augmented osteogenic signaling by inhibiting GSK3, which in turn activated the anabolic Wnt/β-catenin pathway.10 It should be noted that Li has several osteoprotective effects acting on other pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) transduction pathways (for review see40). Altogether, the results from our study warrant future investigations with spaceflight and/or HLS to examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 before and during microgravity exposure to further establish whether targeting GSK3 can exert musculoskeletal protection against spaceflight. Undoubtedly, other GSK3 inhibitors aside from Li that are more specific to GSK3 would be important to test and could include drugs like tideglusib, which is the most clinically advanced GSK3 inhibitor currently being tested for other diseases and conditions.41,42 We have recently shown that tideglusib treatment can preserve muscle size, strength, and quality in dystrophic mice.24 The limitations of our study include low sample size, particularly with the RR1 and BION-M1 missions. Although the RR1 mission was conducted in female mice, the limitation in sample size prevented us from truly examining any potential influence of biological sex. Future studies, with age-matched male and female mice, preferably part of the same mission, are required to better elucidate the potential sex-specific effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system. Our study was also limited in that we were not able to obtain bone samples from all missions, and thus our analysis was restricted to the RR9 mission. Within this mission, μCT analyses of the tibia indicated that cortical bone was primarily affected by spaceflight. However, we suspect that limitations in sample size prevented us from detecting a statistically significant effect on trabecular bone. Indeed, previous μCT analyses in the lumbar vertebrae and femur from the BION-M1 mission showed significant reductions in trabecular bone outcomes in the F group versus GC and VIV controls.43 In muscle, where we obtained samples from RR9, RR1, RR18, and BION-M1 missions, we utilized a “meta-analytical” approach with the fold-change response as the common measure of effect size. However, differences in experimental conditions (i.e., food, temperature, pressure, strain differences, age differences, and etc.) should not be discounted. These differences could have contributed to the differences in phosphorylation status of GSK3, where we found significant increases in Ser phosphorylation of GSK3 in BION-M1 and RR18 F soleus muscles but not in any other soleus muscles from RR1 or RR9. Finally, our study is limited in that we did not assess the effects of bone-specific Gsk3 deletion on BMD and strength in response to HLS. Future studies should generate these mice and perform these experiments to firmly establish whether GSK3 inhibition before simulated microgravity exposure can protect against bone loss. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that inhibiting GSK3 specifically in muscle may exert positive effects on the bone thereby highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with whole-body GSK3 inhibition afforded through pharmacological means. In summary, our study shows that GSK3 content and activation status are altered in murine soleus and bone samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight. Although GSK3β content was reduced after spaceflight, our results with the simulated microgravity HLS model shows that inhibiting GSK3 before muscle unloading via muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion can increase muscle mass, myogenic signaling, and can preserve muscle force production. Moreover, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion may also help to maintain bone mass by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5; and thus, future studies aboard the ISS are warranted to examine whether these mice are protected against spaceflight-induced declines in musculoskeletal health. In addition, future studies that examine the effects of pharmacological, and thus, whole-body GSK3 inhibition before and during spaceflight should also be done in mice. Collectively, our present study represents an important first step in hopes of enabling longer duration spaceflight missions to Mars – possibly through GSK3 inhibition.STAR★Methods Key resources table REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies GSK3β Cell signaling Cat# 9315; RRID: AB_490890 GSK3β (Ser9 phosphorylated) Cell signaling Cat# 9322; RRID: AB_2115196 GSK3α Cell signaling Cat# 4818; RRID: AB_10831511 GSK3α (Ser9 phosphorylated) Cell signaling Cat# 9316; RRID: AB_659836 PGC-1α Millipore Cat# ST1204; RRID: AB_10807905 COXIV Abcam Cat# ab16056; RRID: AB_443304 FNDC5 Abcam Cat# ab131390 MHCI DHSB Cat# BA-F8; RRID: AB_10572253 MHC IIa DHSB Cat# SC-71; RRID: AB_2147165 MHC IIx DHSB Cat# 6H1; RRID: AB_1157897 MHC IIb DHSB Cat# BF-F3; RRID: AB_2266724 Pax7 DHSB Cat# APAX7; RRID: AB_2299243 Myogenin DHSB Cat# Myog; RRID: AB_2722260 Anti-mouse HRP Cell Signaling Cat# 7076; RRID: AB_330924 Anti-rabbit HRP Cell Signaling Cat# 7074; RRID: AB_2099233 Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit ThermoFisher Cat# A27040; RRID: AB_2536101 Alexa Fluor 350 anti-mouse ThermoFisher Cat# A-21140; RRID: AB_2535777 Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse ThermoFisher Cat# A-21121; RRID: AB_2535764 Alexa Fluor 555 anti-mouse ThermoFisher Cat# A-21426; RRID: AB_2535847 Biological samples RR9 soleus and tibialis anterior NASA Biospecimens Sharing Program N/A RR1 soleus NASA Biospecimens Sharing Program N/A RR18 soleus NASA Biospecimens Sharing Program N/A BION-M1 soleus and extensor digitorum longus Dr. Fabrice Bertile (Strasbourg, France) N/A Experimental models: Organisms/strains GSK3α/β floxed mice Brock University N/A ACTA-1 Cre mice Jackson Laboratories and now housed at Brock University N/A Software and algorithms Molecular Devices SoftMax Pro Molecular Devices https://www.moleculardevices.com/products/microplate-readers/acquisition-and-analysis-software/softmax-pro-software?cmp=7010g000000nNCH&utm_source=AdWords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=MPR-Brand_CANADA&utm_adgroup={adgroup}&utm_location=9000776&utm_keyword=molecular%20devices%20softmax%20pro&utm_device=c&utm_devicemodel=&utm_placement=&utm_adpostion=&utm_target=&utm_network=g&utm_creative=413034758091&gclid=CjwKCAjw0dKXBhBPEiwA2bmObfQYfxhI9dqx2kDoEaENs2bFYuBzCML-NluCxhjnZ3efLgFFif0rvhoCsnYQAvD_BwE ImageLab BioRad https://www.bio-rad.com/fr-ca/product/image-lab-software?ID=KRE6P5E8Z Graphpad Prism 8 Graphpad Prism https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/ ImageJ  https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html NRecon V.1.7.3.1 software Bruker microCT N/A Osteosys software for INSIGHT small animal DXA scanner Scintica https://www.scintica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FAQ-iNSiGHT-DXA_v0122-1.pdf Aurora Scientific 600A software Aurora Scientific https://aurorascientific.com/products/muscle-physiology/muscle-daq-software/600a-real-time-muscle-system/ Open in a new tabResource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Val A.

For all missions, we were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the BION-M1 mission, male C57BL/6N (19–20 week old at time of launch) mice were maintained in high-orbit (∼550 km) for 30 days in specialized flight modules.44 For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) and female C57BL/6J (RR1, 16 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats45 on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere for RR1, RR9, and BION-M1.18,19 For the RR18 mission, flight mice were aboard the ISS for 30 days with weekly injections of either sterile saline (0.9%) or the antioxidant metalloporphyrin (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, herein referred to as BuOE). The mice used in this study were part of a live animal return cohort where tissue dissection occurred 1 day after landing. Soleus muscles were collected and stored in RNAlater at −80°C, prior to being homogenized in PMSF buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5)). We did not find any differences in GSK3 content or MHC isoform expression between the two saline and BuOE cohorts, and thus we elected to keep them separate in our analysis. In addition to the F, GC, and VIV groups, we also received two cohort control groups from the RR9 mission. Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018. Thus, differences in GSK3 expression and activation were first examined in R9 cohort controls to determine if a normalizing factor would be required. Importantly, we found no differences in GSK3 phosphorylation in the TA muscles from Cohort Control 1 (CC1) and Cohort Control 2 (CC2) (Figure S12). We also found no significant differences between cohort controls (CC1 vs. CC2) in any of the bone outcomes measured (Table S3).Animals Skeletal muscle-specific Gsk3 partial knockdown mice of a C57BL/6J background were generated by crossing GSK3α/β floxed mice (kindly donated by Dr. Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania) with ACTA-1-Cre mice (Jackson laboratories) under the control of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter.23 Heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice also heterozygously expressing ACTA-1 Cre were considered GSK3mKD, whereas heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice without ACTA-1 Cre were considered the flox control (GSK3flox). For the lithium feeding experiments, male 3–6 month old C57BL/6 mice were used. All mice were fed a standard chow diet (2014 Teklad global, 14% protein rodent maintenance diet, Harlan Teklad, Mississauga, ON), and were kept on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water through the entirety of the study. Mice were housed at a temperature of 22–24°C for the duration of the study.Ethics statement This study utilized murine muscle samples provided to us through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. All animal procedures performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Experimental protocols for the GSK3mKD and lithium feeding experiments were approved by the Brock University Animal Care Committee (files #17-06-03, #20-07-01, and #21-06-02) and were in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care.Method details Hindlimb suspension For the hindlimb suspension (HLS) experiments, the hindlimbs of male GSK3mKD and GSK3flox (4–6 month old) mice were suspended using a taping method where the tails of mice were taped to a copper ring attached to a steel bar that was mounted on top of a modified mouse cage. For these experiments, mice were pair-housed in the cages and had as libitum access to food and water. After 7-day of HLS, all mice were sacrificed via cervical dislocation (under isoflurane) and their soleus muscles were collected.Lithium feeding and tenotomy surgery For the lithium feeding study, C57BL/6 male mice (3–6 months of age) were randomly divided into a control or lithium group. The lithium group received a dose of 10 mg/kg/day of LiCl via their drinking water as previously described10,23,25,46 whereas the control group received drinking water without LiCl supplementation. The total duration of treatment was 6 weeks. On the fourth week, all mice underwent the tenotomy surgery as previously described.47,48,49 Briefly, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, prior to severing the soleus and gastrocnemius tendons from one leg. A sham surgery was conducted on the contralateral leg to serve as an internal control. Both wounds on both legs were closed with silk suture and mice were returned to their home cages, where LiCl or control treatment was maintained for an additional two weeks prior to euthanization. After euthanizing the mice via cervical dislocation, soleus muscles were collected for future analyses.DXA scanning of individual bones A small animal DXA scanner (OsteoSys InSIGHT, Scintica) was used to scan the individual femur bones collected from the RR9 mission. Overall coefficient of variation of our analysis was 1.7% for BMD and 3.2% for BMC. In addition, we also performed region-specific BMD analysis for the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine from mobile and HLS GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice.Soleus muscle contractility Soleus muscle contractility was assessed as previously described25,47 at 25°C using an Aurora Scientific contractile apparatus with a biphasic simulator (model 305B and 701B). Soleus muscles were subjected to a force frequency curve (1, 20, 40, 80 and 160) with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.50 For force-frequency analysis, peak isometric force was obtained. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated using the following formula: CSA = m/l∗d∗(Lf/Lo), where m, muscle mass (mg); l, muscle length (mm); d, mammalian skeletal muscle density (1.06 mg/mm3); Lf/Lo is the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio (0.71 for soleus). Specific force was calculated by normalizing peak isometric force by CSA.Western blotting A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was used to determine sample protein concentration using an M2 Molecular Devices Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). Western blotting was performed to determine GSK3β, phosphorylated (p)-GSK3β, GSK3α, (p)-GSK3α, β catenin, MHC I, MHC IIa, MHC IIx, MHC IIb. Antibodies from pGSK3β (9336), total (t)-GSK3-β (9315), pGSK3α (9316), tGSK3α (4818), β-Catenin (8480) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). MHC I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIx (6H1), and IIb (BF-F3) antibodies as well as the antibodies for Pax7 (AB_528428) and myogenin (F5D) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). The antibodies for FNDC5 and COXIV were obtained from Abcam (ab13190 and abS16056, respectively) and the antibody for PGC-1α was obtained from Millipore (ST1204). All Western blots used BioRad TGX 4–15% gradient gels (4561086: BioRad) and PVDF membranes. Samples were then prepped and equally loaded for gel electrophoresis. Transfer was conducted via BioRad Transblot Turbo. Following transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 60 min or BioRad Every Blot blocking buffer (12010020) for 10 min. Following blocking, the appropriate primary antibody was appropriately diluted and added during an overnight incubation at 4°C. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with TBST then incubated for 60 min with the analogous secondary anti-mouse (7076; Cell Signaling Technology; MHC I, IIa, IIx, IIb) or anti-rabbit (7074; Cell Signaling Technology; p-GSK3α, GSK3α p-GSK3β, GSK3β, β-catenin) antibody both conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Upon secondary incubation, membranes were washed another 3 times with TBST for 5-min each. Millipore Immobilon (#WBKLSO500) chemiluminescent substrate was added and then visualized using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP for protein detection. Ponceau staining was used for protein normalization (59803; Cell Signaling Technology).GSK3 fiber type analysis To assess the fiber type expression of GSK3β, we performed immunofluorescent microscopy experiments on serial 10 μm cryosections obtained from O.C.T. (optimal cutting temperature) embedded soleus and EDL muscles from n = 3 mobile wild-type C57BL/6J male mice. One serial cryosection underwent immunofluorescent fiber type staining as previously described to demarcate the various fiber types with MHC I, IIa, IIx, and IIb isoforms.30,47 The other serial cryosection underwent immunofluorescent staining with a primary antibody for GSK3β (9315, Cell Signaling, 1:2500 dilution) and an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescent secondary antibody (A27040, ThermoFisher Scientific, 1:5000 dilution). Once fiber types were identified with MHC isoform expression/fluorescence, GSK3β was quantified by converting the image to grayscale and quantifying the mean gray value with ImageJ. Within a single muscle, 10 of each fiber type were randomly analyzed.Histological analysis Soleus muscles embedded in O.C.T. matrix from GSK3mKD and GSK3flox HLS mice were processed into 10 μm cryosections prior to undergoing H&E staining. For each muscle, 2–3 images were randomly taken and the CSA of 20 fibers per mouse (n = 3–4 per group) were obtained using ImageJ. For central nuclei counts, the total number of fibers from the H&E images were counted, ranging from 150 to 230 fibers per image and the number of fibers with central nuclei calculated as a percent of the total number of fibers within the image.Micro-computed tomography bone imaging Micro-computed tomography (μCT, SkyScan 1176 V.1.1 build 12, Bruker microCT, Belgium) was performed as previously described.51 Following euthanasia, the right tibia was excised, cleaned of surrounding tissue, and wrapped in parafilm wax to prevent moisture loss throughout the duration of the 180-degree high resolution (9 μm) scan. A 0.25 mm aluminum filter was applied. The beam strength was set at 45 kV and 545 μA for an exposure time of 850 ms. Resulting images were reconstructed (smoothing kernel = 2, ring artifact reduction = 8, beam hardening = 30%, and dynamic image range = 0.000–0.155; NRecon V.1.7.3.1 software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) into 3D images and reoriented in anatomical position (DataViewer V.1.5.6.2 64-bit software, Bruker microCT, Belgium) for consistency when selecting the regions of interest. Quantification of trabecular and cortical bone structure outcomes was performed at the proximal tibia and tibia midpoint, respectively.Assessment of trabecular bone structure at the proximal tibia Trabecular bone region of interest began 0.855 mm from the point in which the primary spongiosa disconnects and formation of the growth plate is evident and expanded 0.675 mm toward the tibia midpoint. Trabecular bone was manually delineated from the cortical bone and quantified using an adaptive thresholding of 49 to determine total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, trabecular number, degree of anisotropy, and connectivity density.Assessment of cortical bone structure at the tibia midpoint For cortical bone structure analysis, the tibia midpoint was used to define the region of interest (0.450 mm toward the proximal and distal ends; total height of 0.900 mm). Cortical bone structure outcomes, including total cross-sectional area, cortical area, cortical area fraction, cortical thickness, periosteal perimeter, endocortical perimeter, medullary area, and eccentricity, were calculated using an adaptive threshold of 67.Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical analyses To examine the combined effect of spaceflight on GSK3 content and phosphorylation, fold-change values were calculated for each mission relative to the average of both GC and VIV controls. The fold-change values were compared with GCVIV controls using a Student’s t test. For the western blot data across the individual experiments (Figures S1–S3, S5, and S6), a one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunnet’s post-hoc test was used to strictly compare GC vs. Flight and VIV vs. Flight. This method was chosen since no significant differences between GC and VIV for any outcome measure related to muscle were detected for any mission. Similarly, for the bone analysis (DXA, μCT, and western blot analyses) GC and VIV controls were combined as there were no differences between the two groups. This was done to increase statistical power. A Student’s t test was then used to make comparisons between F and GCVIV. For the GSK3mKD experiments, most comparisons were made Student’s t test unless otherwise stated where a two-way ANOVA was used. For the lithium and tenotomy experiments, a two-way ANOVA was also used to test the main effects of lithium treatment and tenotomy. All data are presented as mean +/− standard error unless stated otherwise. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality for both studies. Statistical tests were conducted through GraphPad Prism 8 Software. Any statistical outliers detected using the ROUT test (Q = 5%) on GraphPad Prism were removed prior to analysis. A p ≤ 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.Acknowledgments This work was supported by a Brock University Vice President Research Discretionary Fund (to VAF), a CRC Tier 2 Award (to VAF), a Canadian Space Agency Grant (to VAF and WEW), as well as an NSERC Discovery Grants (to VAF, WEW, and AJM).

All mice were treated weekly with either BuOE (1 mg/kg) or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for the duration of spaceflight.

SERCA activity assay and ionophore ratio SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay as previously described19. Full SERCA ATPase-pCa curves were run in the presence of ionophore as well as in the absence of ionophore specifically at maximal stimulating Ca2+ concentrations (pCa = 5.0) to gain a measure of SR Ca2+ leak and permeability as previously described34–36. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 induces SR membrane permeability, which encourages maximal SERCA activity by preventing back inhibition. Thus, if the SR membrane is inherently ‘leaky’ then the calculated ionophore ratio (maximal SERCA activity in the presence of ionophore: maximal SERCA activity in the absence of ionophore) will be relatively smaller. Western blotting Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD, and the three SERCA regulators, sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as previously described5,19.

Copyright notice ID: 11271499 PMID: 39030182 Abstract Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. Subject terms: Calcium channels, Physiology Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to cause extensive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially to postural muscles such as the soleus1–6. Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness precedes muscle atrophy4 and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca2+ dysregulation7. Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR) -1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca2+ uptake ability of the sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely impaired following ~1 month of spaceflight5. In muscle, SERCA is responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) by bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)8,9. Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca2+]i, leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and muscle weakness and atrophy10–14. Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly susceptible to post-translational modifications (e.g., tyrosine nitration, cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic activity 5,15–22. The ensuing elevated [Ca2+]i will not only lead to muscle damage but can also further increase RONS production23–25 creating a negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology. While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signaling molecules at low concentrations26. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for review, see ref. 27). Mice deficient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity, muscle weakness, and atrophy11,20,22; but, the pharmacological activation of SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle atrophy despite increased oxidative stress11,12. Thus, targeting SERCA, either through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic28,29, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. BuOE has been effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-induced injury30–33, a relevant injury mechanism to spaceflight, providing strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study. Following 35 days of exposure to microgravity, absolute soleus weight was significantly reduced in the flight groups compared to GC/VIV groups (p = 0.0005) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 1A). No effects of flight or treatment were observed on body weight (Fig. 1B) resulting in a main effect of flight reducing the soleus:body weight ratio (p = 0.0053, Fig. 1C). Fig. 1. Spaceflight induces soleus muscle atrophy that is not attenuated by BuOE treatment. Open in a new tab Soleus weight is significantly reduced following spaceflight (A) with no changes in body weight (B), resulting in a significant reduction of the soleus:body weight ratio in the flight groups compared to controls (C). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented above the graphs.Ionophore supported Ca2+-dependent SERCA ATPase activity was assessed across a range of [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0–5.0) and was presented as percentage of maximal activity (Fig. 2A) to assess the pCa50 (i.e., [Ca2+] required to elicit ½ maximal activity) as a measure of SERCA’s apparent affinity for Ca2+. There was no effect of spaceflight or BuOE treatment on maximal SERCA ATPase activity (Fig. 2B), but a main effect of BuOE treatment increasing SERCA’s apparent affinity for Ca2+ was detected (p = 0.0323, Fig. 2C). In dividing the maximal ATPase rates with ionophore (no Ca2+ gradient) by the rates without ionophore (Ca2+ gradient), a measure of SR Ca2+ permeability and leak can be obtained34–36. In doing this, we observed a main effect of flight reducing the ionophore ratio (p = 0.0255, Fig. 2D), indicative of increased SR Ca2+ leak. Fig. 2. BuOE increases SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ and exposure to microgravity reduces SERCA’s ionophore ratio. Open in a new tab SERCA activity-pCa curves presented as % max (A). No changes in maximal SERCA ATPase activity were detected (B); but, a main effect of BuOE increasing the pCa50 was found (C). The ionophore ratio was significantly reduced in spaceflight groups with no effect of BuOE (D). Densitometric analysis and representative western blot images show significant increases in SERCA1a and SERCA2a protein content in the space-flown soleus (E). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented above the graphs (A–D) or above bars (E).Western blotting revealed significant increases in SERCA1a (p = 0.0039) and SERCA2a (p = 0.0107) protein content in the spaceflight groups compared to GC/VIV with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 2E). Total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein, RYR, was also investigated with no effects on total RYR, but increases in p-RYR (increases Ca2+ release) in flight groups compared to GC/VIV, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0905, Fig. 2E). 4-HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation due to increased RONS and therefore serves as a marker of oxidative stress37. Significant increases in 4-HNE were observed in flight groups compared to GC/VIV (p = 0.0387) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 3A). Further, total SOD content was reduced in flight groups compared to controls, though this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0510, Fig. 3A). Investigating protein content of the three SERCA regulators demonstrated dynamic changes in response to spaceflight. Significant reductions in SLN (p = 0.0080), increases in NNAT (p = 0.0158), and reductions in PLN approaching statistical significance (p = 0.0828) were all observed in the space-flown soleus compared to GC/VIV (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. BuOE treatment does not attenuate increased oxidative stress following spaceflight. Open in a new tab Densitometric analysis and representative western blots show significant increases in 4-HNE following spaceflight and reductions in SOD approaching statistical significance with no effects of BuOE treatment (A). Protein content of the three SERCA regulators shows significant reductions in SLN and PLN and significant increases in NNAT following spaceflight (B). All values are mean ± SEM with p-values presented in bars.To extend our previous work demonstrating that soleus SERCA Ca2+ uptake is impaired following spaceflight, which we attributed to increased RONS content5, we investigated whether treatment with the antioxidant, BuOE, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction following spaceflight. We found BuOE was unable to attenuate soleus muscle atrophy following 35 days in space. While BuOE treatment increased SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ in both the GC/VIV and flight groups, it was unable to rescue the significant increases in 4-HNE content or SR Ca2+ leak, measured using an ionophore ratio, induced by microgravity exposure. Consistent with previous work5, we observed increases in protein content of both SERCA isoforms following spaceflight as well as increases in oxidative stress and dynamic changes in the expression of the three SERCA regulators, SLN, NNAT, and PLN. Spaceflight also tended to reduce SOD content and increase p-RYR, both of which may be contributing to increased SR Ca2+ leak. Past literature using both ground-based and spaceflight models in rodents and humans has begun to suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in skeletal muscle may be an early step in the pathogenesis of weakness and atrophy4,5,38. Specifically, we have previously shown the Ca2+ uptake ability of SERCA to be impaired following spaceflight which we attributed, at least partially, to increases in total protein RONS5. SERCA pumps have highly susceptible tyrosine residues that, in the presence of increased RONS, can result in tyrosine nitration15–18. Tyrosine 294 and 295 of SERCA appear to be most vulnerable to tyrosine nitration and reside in the transmembrane domain of the pump, a necessary domain for Ca2+ translocation16. The structural changes that ensue following tyrosine nitration of these residues result in impaired catalytic activity and increased [Ca2+]i. Here, we investigated ATPase activity of the SERCA pump and found no changes in response to microgravity; though, we do observe a main effect of BuOE treatment increasing SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. This is consistent with our previous work showing that heterozygous deletion of SOD2 reduces SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+20. The increases in both SERCA isoforms with spaceflight are consistent with our previous work5 and were similarly unable to attenuate spaceflight-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Given that SERCA density is the primary determinant of Ca2+ uptake39 the increased protein content should increase SERCA catalytic activity; however, this was not detected, suggesting protein dysfunction or a failed compensatory response. The mechanism underlying increased SERCA protein expression following spaceflight requires further investigation but has been observed in other muscle-wasting diseases and myopathies21,40,41. SLN and PLN act to reduce SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake through reductions in affinity as well as inducing Ca2+ slippage42–44; however, no effects of BuOE were detected on the protein expression of SLN, NNAT, or PLN with the only changes being observed with spaceflight. With regards to the SERCA regulators, inconsistencies were observed with the previous RR-9 mission where there was a clear increase in SLN and decrease in NNAT following spaceflight5; but, RR-18 shows the opposite with reductions in SLN and increases in NNAT, which is maintained even when loaded on the same gel (Supplemental Fig. 1A, B). At present, we can only speculate that possible differences in reloading time (~20 h for RR-1845 and ~38 h for RR-946) would lead to altered expression patterns, but this warrants further investigation. It has been well established that Ca2+ accumulates in the cytosol of muscle fibers following unloading7,47–51 and we also contribute to the growing literature on Ca2+ dysregulation by demonstrating that SR Ca2+ leak is significantly increased in the murine soleus following microgravity exposure, consistent with what has been reported with hindlimb suspension52. Increased SR Ca2+ leak has been observed in various muscle pathologies, many of which are related to post-translational modifications of RYR and its regulators53–56. Here, we observed increases in phosphorylated RYR, albeit non-statistically significant, that may still be contributing to increased Ca2+ leak. Notably, previous work has demonstrated that blocking L-type Ca2+ channels attenuates unloading-induced Ca2+ overload in the rat soleus57. In addition to alterations to RYR, the lipid composition of the SR membrane can also drastically alter Ca2+ handling34,58,59. More specifically, it has been shown that increased lipid peroxidation will increase membrane permeability60–62 and with significant increases in 4-HNE, a product of lipid peroxidation37, in the space-flown soleus, it is likely that alterations to SR permeability are contributing to increased Ca2+ leak, though more targeted studies are required. As well as SR Ca2+ leak, there are several other mechanisms that can lead to elevations in [Ca2+]i that were not explored in the present study. One such mechanism is early muscle membrane depolarization, due to reduced Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity63,64, possibly triggering the opening of the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors and increasing [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ overload may also be a product of store-operated Ca2+ entry - the process of Ca2+ influx triggered by reductions in SR luminal [Ca2+] (for review, see ref. 65), which could be triggered by SERCA dysfunction. This phenomenon has been identified to contribute to Ca2+ overload in dystrophic muscle66,67 and various other myopathies68, though its contributions to muscle atrophy and weakness following unloading remain to be explored. In skeletal muscle, BuOE was unable to attenuate the increases in 4-HNE caused by spaceflight; but, was effective in reducing 4-HNE in the retina from the same mice45, indicative of tissue-specific responses to BuOE at the dose provided in this study. Though speculative, it is possible that BuOE was unable to compensate for the reductions in SOD content observed following spaceflight, an effect also seen in astronaut muscle following spaceflight, albeit in hair samples69. Future studies focused on skeletal muscle, namely SERCA function in the soleus, may benefit from higher doses of BuOE treatment or other modes of cytotoxic protection. For example, HSP70 can protect SERCA from oxidant damage in conditions of muscular dystrophy70, and it would be of interest to determine whether pharmacological induction or genetic overexpression of HSP70 could protect SERCA function in the context of spaceflight. While we were limited in our ability to measure the sources of RONS in this study, previous work has demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction71,72, and increased NADPH oxidase expression and activity73,74 to contribute to RONS production with spaceflight and simulated microgravity exposure. Further investigation into whether targeting RONS production at the source can counteract muscle weakness and atrophy is needed. Regardless, targeting Ca2+ leak from the SR has shown to be beneficial to muscle health in aged mice75, hypoxia-induced atrophy in rodents76, and murine dystrophic muscle77 indicating that this may be a viable target for spaceflight-induced changes in SR permeability and leak. Importantly, a recent study by Sharlo, et al. 78 treated rats with the SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simulated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of Ca2+ homeostasis. This finding, along with others targeting SERCA activation in situations of muscle impairment11,12 demonstrate the importance of directly targeting SERCA in space. We observe some discrepancies related to SLN expression following spaceflight between the RR-95 and the present RR-18 study. SLN expression has been shown to upregulated in several muscle-wasting conditions, but whether this upregulation is beneficial or detrimental to muscle is still under debate (for review, see ref. 79). Procedurally, the RR-1, RR-9, and RR-18 studies all maintained mouse strain and housing temperature but disparities in reloading time prior to euthanasia (RR-9, ~38 h46; RR-18, ~20 h45) may contribute to the differences in SLN expression between missions. This hypothesis remains speculative but would be an interesting avenue of investigation in the future. Finally, due to limitations on the amount of sample, we were unable to investigate SERCA-specific analysis of RONS modifications which could provide insight into the changes in Ca2+ affinity observed here. In summary, with soleus muscles from space-flown male mice, we investigated the effects of antioxidant treatment with BuOE on soleus muscle atrophy, SERCA ATPase function, and SR Ca2+ leak. We found spaceflight to induce soleus muscle atrophy and increases in SR Ca2+ leak that could not be overcome by BuOE treatment, despite increases in SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. Future studies aimed at reducing Ca2+ leak or increasing SERCA activation could reveal SERCA and Ca2+ handling as viable targets to counteract weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Methods Muscle samples Soleus muscles were obtained from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection. Muscles came from male C57BL/6 J mice from the RR-18 mission which had two control groups, ground control (GC) and vivarium (VIV) control, as well as a flight group which had mice housed on the International Space Station for 35 days as previously described5,45,80–83. All mice were treated weekly with either BuOE (1 mg/kg) or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for the duration of spaceflight. Upon live return to Earth, soleus muscles were dissected and stored in RNALater at −80 °C. Muscles were thawed, rinsed from RNALater, and homogenized in homogenizing buffer prior to further analysis5.SERCA activity assay and ionophore ratio SERCA ATPase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay as previously described19. Full SERCA ATPase-pCa curves were run in the presence of ionophore as well as in the absence of ionophore specifically at maximal stimulating Ca2+ concentrations (pCa = 5.0) to gain a measure of SR Ca2+ leak and permeability as previously described34–36. The Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 induces SR membrane permeability, which encourages maximal SERCA activity by preventing back inhibition. Thus, if the SR membrane is inherently ‘leaky’ then the calculated ionophore ratio (maximal SERCA activity in the presence of ionophore: maximal SERCA activity in the absence of ionophore) will be relatively smaller.Western blotting Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the Ca2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD, and the three SERCA regulators, sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as previously described5,19. Specific methods for the aforementioned proteins are listed in Supplemental Table 1.Statistical analysis All data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). No statistical differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups and so they were combined within their respective treatment groups to increase statistical power. A two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was used to compare the main effects of GC/VIV vs flight and saline vs BuOE as well as any interaction that may exist. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05 and outliers were detected and removed prior to analysis if they were ±2 standard deviations from the mean of their respective group. All statistical tests were employed using GraphPad Prism 9. p-values are presented above graphs.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (144.4KB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program for the provision of samples and the NASA Ames Research Center team who worked on the RR-18 mission.

    "abstract": "Abstract The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Changes to the cardiovascular system during spaceflight have prompted molecular biologists to understand the mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to culture aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth. Recent research in our own laboratory has shown that neonatal human CPCs cultured under two-dimensional (2D) clinorotation, which approximates weightlessness by rotating the cell culture vessel about a horizontal axis, exhibit increased expression of markers of early cardiovascular development and pluripotency (i.e., MESP1, T (Brachyury), and OCT4) as well as broad changes to microRNA expression.1 The changes in microRNA expression experienced by CPCs in these experiments mirrored the expression of similar microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) under normal conditions of early cardiovascular development, thereby suggesting that such culture conditions induce an epigenetic environment that favors an earlier development status. Such a state appears increasingly beneficial for cardiovascular repair. For example, the efficacy of multipotent stem cells expressing Isl1+ and SSEA-1+ in ameliorating the symptoms of severe heart failure was recently demonstrated in one patient.2 Furthermore, KEGG analysis indicated that the microRNAs downregulated in CPCs in these experiments target several signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Wnt, which are relevant to well-characterized repair mechanisms or cardiac stem cell proliferation mechanisms in the heart. For example, non-canonical Wnt ligands (i.e., Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) have been shown to be associated with the injury response in neonatal rodent heart tissue.3 Therefore, our observations suggest that 2D clinorotation may foster a developmental state and signaling events that could enhance the use of CPCs for cardiovascular repair. This is supported by one recent study by Jha et al.4, which demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cells more readily differentiate into cardiomyocytes following three-dimensional (3D) (i.e., embryoid) culture under the influence of a random positioning machine. In the context of our previous findings, these experiments may highlight a potential phenomenon in which 2D clinorotation promotes an enhanced state of stemness that results in increased differentiation potential when the cells are returned to normal gravity conditions. It is currently believed that small RhoGTPases act as transducers of the mechanical alterations that are observed under conditions of spaceflight.5,6 As actors in the planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, they have central roles in cytoskeletal remodeling. Along with the Hippo pathway and calcium signaling, small RhoGTPases represent one potential molecular substrate of gravity sensing. Notably, in the context of cardiogenesis, these processes are central to maintaining multipotency or directing differentiation.7 Despite the early reports of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells, much is unknown about the mechanisms by which CPCs respond to spaceflight or how these cell types develop enhanced stemness. Hence, we are not yet able to leverage the therapeutic potential of spaceflight here on Earth. While current clinical trials to stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising,8–10 they are stymied by a failure of cells to engraft into the host tissue and by the use of progenitor types that are restricted in potency.11 Therefore, identifying the molecular events that promote enhanced stemness and regenerative potential in CPCs during spaceflight will benefit stem cell-based cardiac repair. The successful use of autologous CPC sources to regenerate heart tissue in a predominately adult population requires additional understanding of the differences between adult and neonatal CPCs. Our laboratory has previously documented differences in age-dependent expression of microRNAs related to MAPK signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction expression, and focal adhesion maintenance.12 The relationship between these processes and the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight remain unknown, but they imply deficits in the intracellular transduction of environmental cues in the functional shortcomings of adult CPCs. Therefore, in this study, clonal lines of neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the ISS. We sought to identify changes in these CPCs in response to spaceflight that impact signaling, development, and stemness. We then characterized the divergent response of neonatal and adult CPCs to spaceflight. In doing so, we present components of the adaptive cellular response to culture aboard the ISS and their implications for enhancing the regenerative potential of neonatal and adult CPCs.",
    "methods": "Methods Isolation and culture of early CPCs CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1 day–1 month) or adult (57–72 year old) human patients, as previously described.27 The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient-specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0 mm3) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1 mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40-µm cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion. Cells were then screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit. Clonal CPC cultures were selected for other markers of early cardiac development (KDR and PDGFRA) and then supplemented with growth media comprised of 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 µg/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 22% endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mycoplasma contamination was tested using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometry Progenitor cell populations were fluorescently labeled with antibodies, as recommended by their respective manufacturers. Briefly, for developmental marker detection, CPCs were incubated with Viobility 405/520 before being washed in 1 × PBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.5% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Then, CPCs were stained for cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (PDGFRα, CXCR4, c-Kit, and SSEA1). CPCs were then fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), blocked in 0.6 M glycine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution containing 10% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL), and stained for intracellular, cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (Isl1 and Mesp1). For directed differentiation assays, cells were stained for TropT after being fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or directly for vWF or SMA. Stained CPCs were then analyzed using a MACSQuant® analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Quantification of data was performed using FlowJo software version 10 (Ashland, OR). Compensation was performed using UltraComp eBeads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, one drop of compensation beads were incubated with each antibody individually for 30 min at 4 °C and then detected using the same MACSQuant® analyzer just prior to experiments requiring compensation. FlowJo was then used to generate a compensation matrix, which was applied to all experimental data. Information concerning antibodies, isotype controls, and reagents used in antibody labeling is provided in Table S2. Directed differentiation of CPCs To validate the ability of neonatal and adult CPCs to differentiate into cells of the cardiovascular lineage, directed differentiation assays were performed, as described in Le et al.40 and Smits et al.41 In brief, to generate cardiomyocytes, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent. CPC growth media was then replaced with differentiation media (47% IMDM, 47% Ham’s F12 with GlutaMAX, 2% penicillin–streptomycin, 2% horse serum, 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution, and 1% insulin-transferring selenium (all reagents from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5 µM 5-Azacytidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)), which was refreshed daily for 3 days. Then, 1 ng/mL TGF-β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in fresh differentiation media was added routinely until day 14, at which time cells were stained for TropT or placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis. To generate endothelium, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 25 ng/mL Bmp4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 50 ng/mL Vegf (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 days. The media was then replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 50 ng/mL Vegf and cultured for 4 days. Then, cells were regularly fed endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) until day 14, at which time cells were stained for vWF, placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis, or seeded onto Matrigel for endothelial-like tube formation assay analysis, as described below. Finally, to generate smooth muscle cells, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 4.5 g/L d-glucose, 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 50 ng/mL PDGF-BB (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This media was regularly replaced until day 14, at which time cells were stained for smooth muscle actin or placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis. CPC culture aboard the ISS Neonatal and adult CPCs were seeded into Biocells (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO) at two seeding densities (7500 cells or 5000 cells) and loaded into self-contained environments containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The seeding conditions were carefully titrated on Earth to identify the most optimal conditions under which CPCs could be cultured over the course of the experiment. These conditions were then tested during an Experiment Verification Test, which was performed with BioServe Space Technologies ahead of the mission launch. They were then flown aboard SpaceX CRS-11 to the US National Lab on the ISS where they were placed in an incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fresh media was provided every 4 to 5 days while aboard the ISS (Fig S3). At 12 days, the Biocells that were seeded with 7500 cells were flooded with RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at −80 °C. At 30 days, the Biocells seeded with 5000 cells were fed and returned to Earth. Clone-matched and passage-matched ground controls were fed and treated in parallel with the feeding schedule and activities performed by astronauts aboard the ISS. Post-flight sample processing Upon landing and retrieval of the payload, live cells were trypsinized, counted, and used to assess cell cycle, migration, and endothelial-like tube formation, as well as to prepare protein lysates. Biocells containing cells fixed and frozen in RNAprotect were thawed at room temperature. The RNAprotect was removed and centrifuged at 10,000×g at 4 °C for 10 min. Biocells were disassembled and the culture membranes were then rinsed with TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was purified from the RNAprotect samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), per the manufacturer’s instructions, while total RNA was purified from TRIzol® reagent using isopropanol-based and ethanol-based precipitation. cDNA was generated and RT-PCR was performed as described below. RT2 microRNA profiler array and miRNA RT-PCR MicroRNA array profiling was performed as previously described.1 Briefly, the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to convert 500 ng of total RNA into cDNA, which was diluted, added to miScript SYBR Green PCR master mix and 10× universal primer mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and run on human development and differentiation miScript plates (MIHS-103ZA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fold changes were determined for each clone using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/) using all available housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two-tailed Student’s t-test to calculate P-values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below. Individual primers for SNORD96a, SNORD72, hsa-miR-100-5p, and hsa-miR-99a-5p (SABiosciences, Valencia CA) were also used (Table S2). The average Ct value of SNORD96a and SNORD72 was used as a housekeeping control. The PCR conditions for the microRNA arrays and individual microRNA assays were: 95 °C for 15 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 70 °C for 30 s. Differences in fold changes between ground-cultured and ISS-cultured CPCs were then analyzed as described in the statistics sub-section. MicroRNA targeting prediction KEGG analysis was performed using DIANA mirPath version 3 and TarBase v7.042 for microRNAs that were found to be significantly altered in neonatal and adult CPCs. Results were merged by pathway union after controlling for error rate due to multiple comparisons via selecting the “correct for FDR” feature. After removing categories related to cancer, neurological diseases, and viruses/pathogenesis, the KEGG categories whose P-values were <0.05 were reported. RT2 profiler array We used custom array plates (CLAH22469A; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions to measure gene expression changes in ISS-cultured adult and neonatal CPCs that were relevant to Wnt, ERK, BMP/Smad, and Notch signaling; cytoskeletal maintenance; calcium handling; apoptosis and cell cycle; cardiac development and stemness; and regeneration. Briefly, 2 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, as described above, and then thoroughly mixed with 2×RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix and RNase-free and DNase-free water before being loaded into the profiler array plate. Samples were amplified in the iCycler iQ™5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a protocol of 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Fold changes were determined for each clone individually using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/) using GAPDH and ACTB (β-actin) as housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two-tailed Student’s t-test to calculate P-values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below. Quantitative RT-PCR Changes in the expression of select genes were analyzed using RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from CPCs as described above. cDNA was prepared using 2 µg of RNA with Superscript III (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using Go-Taq® qPCR Mastermix (Promega, Madison, WI) and the iCycler iQ™5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following a protocol of 94 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 46-68 °C (depending on the primer) for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. RT-PCR products were visualized using 1%-2% agarose gel electrophoresis and low mass DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primers were designed using the  Primer-BLAST program and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primers used in experiments are listed in Table S2. Endothelial-like tube formation assay Matrigel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to a 96-well plate (50 μL/well) and hardened in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells (20,000 per well) were then incubated for seven hours in EGM-2 media (Lonza Allendale, NJ) before being stained with Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) for 30 min. Their ability to form capillary-like networks was measured using an EVOS imaging system (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and quantified with ImageJ (v1.47f, , Bethesda, MD). Cell cycle analysis Aliquots of 250,000 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, incubated for 60 min with RNAse A (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and stained with propidium iodide, prior to running samples on a MACSquant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and analyzing cell cycle progression using the Dean–Jett–Fox model in the cell cycle analysis tool of FlowJo software (Ashland, OR). Migration assay CPCs were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in starving medium that contained IMDM with GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1% Insulin–Transferrin–Selenium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.5% FBS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 50,000 CPCs were plated in the top chamber of a 96-well transwell migration assay (Corning, Union City, CA) with 8 μm pores. Standard CPC growth medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL of SDF-1α (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used in the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. After 6 h, migrated cells in the bottom chamber were stained using Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific Pittsburg, PA) and quantified using a FLX800 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Statistical analysis The Shapiro–Wilk test for normality was used to test the normality of data distribution. We then performed a two-tailed, paired t-test to compare the mean of all normally distributed data. Non-normally distributed data were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank text. For cell cycle, migration, and endothelial-like tube formation assay, samples in each group were pooled and either a two-tailed, unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the mean of normally or non-normally distributed data, respectively. All data are reported as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. Prism 7 version 7.02 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. P-values < 0.05 were assumed to indicate statistical significance. Data availability Gene and microRNA expression data used in RT-PCR, custom array, and microarray experiments have been deposited in ’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE110563.43 Additional data relating to this publication are available upon request to the corresponding author.",
    "results": "Results CPCs exhibit markers of early cardiovascular development CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Representative adult and neonatal clones are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig S1. Neonatal and adult CPCs are able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1b), endothelial cells (Fig. 1c), and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1d) when cultured using directed differentiation protocols (Fig. S2). Clonal lines of CPCs obtained from neonatal and adult patients were then flown aboard the ISS for 12 days and fixed in RNAprotect during orbit (Fig. S3). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Spaceflight alters microRNA expression in neonatal and adult early CPCs. Neonatal (blue) and adult (red) CPC clones were screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and then ultimately selected for experiments based upon the co-expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, KDR, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 a. Directed differentiation of these CPCs is able to induce cardiomyocytes b, endothelial cells c, and smooth muscle cells d. Neonatal and adult CPCs both exhibited significant alterations in microRNA expression following 12 days of culture aboard the ISS e. KEGG analysis (Table S1) indicated likely targeting of ECM interactions, membrane metabolism, and Hippo signaling by these microRNAs. n = 3 unique clones per age per group for all miRs, except miR-99a and miR100, which were measured in biological and technical triplicates. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 The spaceflight environment mediates changes to expression of microRNAs that target membrane synthesis and extracellular interactions In an effort to understand the relevant signaling events by which CPCs adapt to culture aboard the ISS, we performed microarray analysis to measure broad alterations to transcriptional control. Among both neonatal and adult CPCs, 14 microRNAs exhibited significant alterations in levels of expression (Fig. 1e). KEGG analysis by age group (Table S1) indicated that fatty acid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interactions, and Hippo signaling were the most significantly affected targets of these microRNAs. Cytoskeletal maintenance is altered in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after culture aboard the ISS Since the pathways targeted by the significantly dysregulated microRNAs affect cytoskeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction pathways (Fig. 2a), we sought to measure changes in the expression of YAP1, a gene involved in Hippo signaling; small RhoGTPases; and cytoskeletal molecules. YAP1 was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.24-fold, P < 0.01) and modestly upregulated in adult CPCs (2.6-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2b). This prompted us to assess the mechanosensitive small RhoGTPases, which indicated that only RHOA was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.15-fold, P < 0.05, Fig. 2c), which led us to assess the possible effects of spaceflight on cytoskeletal dysregulation. In doing so, we found that the cytoskeletal genes VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, and LMNA were all significantly upregulated (5.2-, 22-, 6-, 5.1-, and 10-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) following spaceflight (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, in adult CPCs, only NES expression decreased significantly (0.30-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2d, f). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Spaceflight impacts expression of genes involved in mechanotransduction and cytoskeleton maintenance. Integrin and mechanical signaling impact Hippo activity and small RhoGTPases, which function along the Wnt planar cell polarity pathway a. YAP1 expression was significantly reduced in neonatal CPCs and upregulated in adult CPCs b. RHOA, a small RhoGTPase, was expressed at significantly lower levels in neonatal c, but not adult d, CPCs. Accordingly, cytoskeletal gene expression was significantly upregulated in neonatal e, but not adult f, CPCs. n = 3 biological replicates for all gene expression data, except YAP1 (n = 6 measures of three pooled clones). Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 Transcripts for non-canonical/Ca2+ signaling in neonatal CPCs are elevated during spaceflight Given the role of small RhoGTPases in non-canonical, planar cell polarity Wnt signaling and the impact of RhoA on regulating calcium signaling,13 we sought to assess the expression of genes involved in the canonical and calcium Wnt pathways. (Fig. 3a–f). We observed significantly increased expression of GSK3B (6.8-fold, P < 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3a) and significantly increased expression of CTNNB1 (1.9-fold, P < 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. 3d). Since Gsk3β sequesters β-catenin for degradation in the cytoplasm, thereby suggesting suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in neonatal CPCs and the promotion of canonical Wnt signaling in adult CPCs, we measured non-canonical Wnt ligand expression and that of genes in the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. We measured significantly increased WNT5A and WNT9A expression (36-fold and 17-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3b) and significantly decreased WNT9A expression (0.39-fold, P < 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. 3e). This was supported by significantly increased expression of PLCG1 and PRKCA (14-fold and 12-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) and a general increase in ITPR1 expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3c), but not adult CPCs (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway are expressed at higher levels along with mesendodermal markers in neonatal CPCs. Canonical Wnt signaling genes were measured in neonatal a and adult d CPCs along with non-canonical Wnt ligands b, e. Genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt/calcium pathway were elevated in neonatal c, but not adult f, CPCs. Markers of development were measured in neonatal and adult CPCs, which indicated elevation of early mesodermal markers (i.e., FOXC1, MESP1, and T) in the former and no changes in the latter population g. n = 3 unique clones per group. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05 Neonatal CPCs exhibit increased expression of genes involved in pre-mesodermal development Calcium and Wnt signaling have central roles in cardiogenesis. For this reason, we sought to assess the transcription of markers of various stages of cardiac development. In doing so, we observed that the expression of genes involved in embryonic stem cell self-renewal (POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2), mesodermal specification (FOXC1, MESP1, T), and early cardiogenesis (GATA4, KIT, PDGFRA, ISL1, KDR) increased, while NKX2-5 expression decreased, in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3g). In this population, the expression of genes involved in early mesodermal specification were the most significantly elevated. Conversely, adult CPCs generally exhibited decreased or unchanged expression of genes involved in early developmental processes (Fig. 3g). Expression of BMP4 and TBXs 3, 5, and 18 is elevated under ISS culture in neonatal CPCs These modifications to the expression of genes involved in cardiogenesis motivated us to measure the changes in the expression of genes in the Bmp, Smad, and Tbx families, which have important roles in pre- and early mesodermal development. We measured elevated expression of BMP4, TBX3, TBX5, and TBX18, and a general increase in BMP2 expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 4a). In adult CPCs, SMAD1 exhibited a significant increase in expression, while SMAD2 and TBX18 also trended towards an increase in expression (Fig. 4a). These findings indicate that the transcripts of genes involved in early pre-cardiac mesoderm development are upregulated by spaceflight in neonatal CPCs. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight reduces the propensity for neonatal CPCs to readily form endothelial-like tubes and express markers of terminal mesodermal derivatives. The expression of members of the BMP, Smad, and TBX families of genes was measured a and found to be elevated significantly in neonatal CPCs and modestly in adult CPCs. Following culture in biocells on the ground or the ISS for 30 days, CPCs were placed in endothelial growth media and incubated on Matrigel for 7 h to facilitate endothelial-like tube formation. The length of endothelial-like tubes formed b and the number of branches c were quantified using ImageJ for neonatal ground d and ISS e CPCs as well as for adult ground f and ISS g CPCs (ruler = 1000 µm). Changes in gene expression relevant to mesodermal derivatives were measured in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS for 12 days, indicating decreased expression of cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and osteogenic markers and increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers h. n = 3 unique clones per group for gene expression data; n = 3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay data. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, ***P < 0.001 Spaceflight reduces terminal mesodermal derivative marker expression and endothelial-like tube formation in neonatal CPCs Given the elevated expression of early to pre-mesodermal genes in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs, we sought to measure whether spaceflight impacts the expression of CPC and other mesodermal derivative markers. First, following 30 days in orbit, CPCs were returned to Earth and assayed for endothelial-like tube formation using a widely accepted assay to assess the potency of progenitor cells with the capacity to form tube-like structures.14,15 However, endothelial-specific markers were not measured on space-flown CPCs in this assay. Unlike adult CPCs, neonatal CPCs exhibited a significantly reduced ability to form endothelial-like tubes (Fig. 4b, c). Representative images of endothelial-like tube formation of neonatal ground (Fig. 4d) and ISS (Fig. 4e) as well as adult ground (Fig. 4f) and ISS (Fig. 4g) samples reflect this age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. This impact of ISS culture on endothelial-like tube formation ability led us to measure the expression of markers of other derivatives: cardiomyocyte (TNNT2), endothelial (VWF), and osteoblast (RUNX2). These markers were all significantly reduced in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after 12 days in orbit. Since spaceflight induces pre-cardiac mesodermal marker expression, we sought to assess whether markers of the sinoatrial node, which may represent embryonic myocardium maintained in its primitive state,16 were modified. Indeed, the sinoatrial nodal markers HCN4 and SHOX2 exhibited elevated expression in neonatal CPCs and reduced expression in adult CPCs (Fig. 4h). Taken together, these findings indicate that spaceflight induces a pre-cardiac mesoderm gene expression profile in neonatal CPCs. ISS-cultured neonatal CPCs proliferate more rapidly than adult or ground-control CPCs Given the change in developmental status of the cell, we sought to assess whether such changes would affect the proliferative potential of space-flown CPCs; hence, cell cycling was assessed using flow cytometry. The Dean–Jett–Fox model was fitted to fluorescence intensity curves generated for propidium iodide-stained neonatal and adult CPCs (Fig. 5a). Adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 phase (ISS vs Ground: 71% vs 61%, P < 0.01) and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (ISS vs Ground: 14% vs 17%, P = 0.05) (Fig. 5b). Neonatal CPCs were more frequently in the G2/M phase both on the ground and following culture aboard the ISS. Interestingly, neonatal CPCs exhibited increases in CDKN2A (14-fold, P < 0.05), E2F1 (9-fold, P = 0.01), and PLK1 (8.5-fold, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5c). These modulators of cell cycling were not significantly altered in adult CPCs (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhanced TERT expression (Fig. 5e), was observed in neonatal (6.8-fold, P < 0.05) and adult (21-fold, P < 0.01) CPCs. Regardless of age, CPCs demonstrate enhanced proliferative potential aboard the ISS. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Cell cycling and proliferation are enhanced following spaceflight in neonatal CPCs. Following 30 days of culture aboard the ISS, CPCs were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and measured using flow cytometry. The Dean–Jett–Fox model was then applied to the histogram of propidium iodide fluorescence intensity for ground-cultured and ISS-cultured CPCs a. Upon analysis b, adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. This was supported by increased expression of CDKN2A, E2F1, and PLK1, which function to regulate G1/S arrest, overcome G1/S arrests, and promote G2/M progression, respectively, in neonatal c, but not adult d, CPCs. Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhanced TERT expression e, was observed in both groups. In addition to enhanced proliferation, DNA repair gene expression was induced in neonatal CPCs, as indicated by increased levels of ATM, RAD23, and RAD50 f. Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased DNA repair genes; however, only ATM expression was significantly increased g. n = 3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for cell cycling analysis; n = 3 unique clones per group for all gene expression data, except for E2F1, TERT, ATM, RAD23, and RAD50 (n = 9, three biological samples each measured in triplicate). Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 DNA repair transcripts increased following spaceflight The broad alterations experienced by CPCs and the possibility of exposure to radiation in the extraterrestrial environment prompted us to consider possible cellular stress response mechanisms, including the expression of DNA repair gene programs. In doing so, we measured increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, as indicated by elevated levels of ATM (11-fold, P < 0.05), RAD23 (7.9-fold, P < 0.001), and RAD50 (21-fold, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5f). Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes (Fig. 5g); however, only ATM (24-fold, P = 0.001) expression was significantly elevated. Stress response, but not apoptosis, genes are induced in CPCs Given the broad induction of transcripts associated with DNA repair, we sought to characterize the impact of other stressors that could influence cellular function during spaceflight. Neonatal CPCs exhibited a 25-fold increase (P < 0.05) in NOTCH1 expression (Fig S4A, B), which confers protection as part of the adaptive cardiac stress response.17 In considering stress associated with spaceflight (Fig S4C, D),18,19,20 we found that HSP70 was elevated in both neonatal (12-fold, P < 0.01) and adult (20-fold, P < 0.05) CPCs, while TXNIP, TP53INP, and HMOX1 were all induced only in adult CPCs (21-fold, P < 0.01; 2.2-fold, P < 0.05; 3.2-fold, P < 0.001; respectively). Ultimately, neither adult nor neonatal CPCs exhibited an induction of transcripts associated with the apoptosis pathway (Fig S4E, F). Indeed, neither proliferation nor viability was reduced in either age group (Fig S5A, B). Adult and neonatal CPCs both exhibit a greater migratory capacity after ISS culture In addition to changes in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation, cytoskeletal alterations were anticipated to occur in response to spaceflight. For this reason, we measured the migratory capacity of ISS-cultured CPCs using a Transwell migration assay. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF-1α stimulation (neonate (ISS vs Ground): 2963 ± 15 cells vs 1972 ± 69 cells, P < 0.01; adult (ISS v Ground): 2247 ± 28 cells vs 1394 ± 52 cells, P < 0.001; Fig. 6a). Similarly, SDF1A expression was elevated in both neonatal (32-fold, P < 0.01, Fig. 6b) and adult (37-fold, P < 0.01, Fig. 6c) CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbit. VEGFA expression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs (16-fold, P < 0.01). Thus, CPCs, regardless of age, demonstrate enhanced migratory capacity aboard the ISS. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab CPCs have enhanced migratory capacity following spaceflight. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF-1α stimulation a. Similarly, SDF1A expression was elevated in both neonatal and adult CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbit b, c. VEGFA expression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs b, while most other paracrine and growth factors generally increased regardless of age. n = 5 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay; n = 3 unique clones each measured in triplicate for gene expression experiments. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we found that spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, some of which occurred in an age-dependent manner. In particular, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity following culture aboard the ISS. Meanwhile, adult CPCs experienced little change in the expression of genes indicative of their developmental state, but exhibited changes to migratory capacity. These findings suggest that broad cytoskeletal modifications resulting from reduced mechanotransduction impart improved migratory and adhesion capabilities (Fig. 2a) regardless of age, but that neonatal CPCs are able to propagate or experience additional intracellular signaling events (e.g., calcium signaling) that modify their developmental status. As we have shown elsewhere, one important difference between adult and neonatal CPCs is their epigenetic (i.e., microRNA) environment.12 Several microRNAs were observed to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight in neonatal and adult CPCs. Interestingly, the predicted targets of these microRNAs included activators and repressors of several pathways. A detailed inspection of the putative targets under each pathway impacted by the microRNAs identified in this study revealed the targeting of genes relating to Wnt signaling (FZD3, FZD5, FZD7, FZD8), cytoskeletal regulation (ACTB, ACTG1, LAMC3), cardiovascular development (TGFBR1, BMP2, BMP5, SMAD7), integrin function (ITGB4, ITGAV), extracellular proteins (COL4A2, COL5A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL4A1), and Hippo signaling (TEAD1, YAP1, LATS1). Interestingly, miR-16, whose expression was generally elevated in neonatal CPCs and repressed in adult CPCs, directly targets YAP1, which could account, at least in part, for the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. However, since KEGG analysis only identifies broad categories of genes (i.e., functional categories) that are likely targets of the microRNAs under study, further experiments are warranted to identify the cumulative impact of these microRNAs on signaling in space-flown CPCs. These results motivated us to assess the overall impact of spaceflight on YAP1, an effector of Hippo signaling that functions with TAZ to regulate transcription. Activation of Hippo kinases, such as through a loss of microRNA-mediated repression or through reduced mechanical signaling, results in elevated levels of phosphorylated Yap1 and Taz. This prevents translocation of these transcriptional activators to the nucleus. Similarly, the application of 2D clinorotation to bone mesenchymal stem cells prevented TAZ translocation to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression of RUNX2 and inhibiting osteogenesis.21 Similarly, the decreased expression of YAP1 and RUNX2 observed in this experiment indicate that spaceflight reduces mechanotransduction in neonatal CPCs. In addition to broadly targeting the Hippo signaling pathway and ECM interactions, select microRNAs that were modified by culture aboard the ISS are known to be critically involved in cardiac development. For example, miR-142-3p is involved in targeting genes involved in early cardiac development, such as TBX5.22 Meanwhile, miR-302, which targets the type II BMP receptor to regulate early cardiogenic events, is repressed by Bmp4 in a Smad-dependent manner.23 Interestingly, we observed both reduced expression of miR-302c and elevated expression of BMP4 in CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS. Moreover, studies have demonstrated a direct mechanistic role of certain microRNAs in cardiac regeneration. As neonatal mice age, their cardiomyocytes lose their proliferative potential in a manner that is concomitant with increased let-7 family expression,24 thereby indicating a relationship between let-7 over-expression and reduced proliferative potential. Indeed, let-7c along with miR-99/100, which were significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs, are also critically downregulated during cardiomyocyte proliferation in a zebrafish model after ventricle amputation.25 As part of the amputation injury response, zebrafish cardiomyocytes near the site of injury undergo sarcomeric structure disassembly as a form of limited de-differentiation to prepare myocytes for self-renewal. PLK1, which was upregulated in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS, is involved in this process.26 Interestingly, these changes to the cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes and subsequent limited de-differentiation appears to resemble the effects of 2D clinorotation12,27 and spaceflight on CPCs. Our laboratory has previously measured changes in microRNA expression in neonatal CPCs induced by 2D clinorotation.12 In comparing those findings to the microRNA changes induced by culture aboard the ISS, we found miR-99a and -100 as well as members of the let-7 family, all of which are implicated in differentiation and developmental regulation, exhibit significantly reduced expression under both conditions. Additionally, we have previously compared the effects of spaceflight and 2D clinorotation on the induction of signaling in neonatal CCPs and observed similar activation of calcium and Akt signaling under both conditions. Similarly, both clinorotation and spaceflight induced a gene expression profile that was consistent with an earlier stage of cardiovascular development, and that mechanical signaling processes were involved, at least in part, in mediating these effects. When considered together, these findings indicate that both processes readily alter the developmental properties of neonatal CPCs, possibly through reduced mechanotransduction. Therefore, the recapitulation of spaceflight-induced signaling events using clinorotation may represent an avenue by which ongoing studies can be conducted. This comparative study also allows for the separation of effects due to cell culture stress from those due to mechanical unloading since 2D clinorotation, which utilized cell cultures that were maintained under ideal conditions, elicited a similar effect as spaceflight.27 Alterations to microRNA expression as well as changes to ECM interactions in ISS-cultured CPCs highlight the significance of the environment in directing differentiation. For example, a single population of mesenchymal stem cells can express neurogenic, myogenic, or osteogenic transcription factors when cultured on soft, moderately stiff, or stiff matrices, respectively.28 In our experiments, we observed elevated expression of mesendodermal-stage developmental markers in neonatal CPCs. It is likely that ECM interactions prompted cytoskeleton remodeling while modifying intracellular signaling pathways such that proliferation and stemness were enhanced. Similar experiments in different cell types involving clinorotation or a low Earth orbit cell culture system have demonstrated that such systems modify the differentiation potential of stem cells. Mouse ESCs flown as embryoid bodies during the Space Tissue Loss Experiment exhibited a decrease in the expression of markers of terminal germ layer derivatives while maintaining expression of stem cell renewal markers.29 However, upon return to Earth, these mouse ESCs differentiated more readily into colonies of contracting cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured under conditions of 2D or 3D clinorotation exhibit a reduction in the expression of markers of cartilage and osteoblast formation,30,31 while also demonstrating enhanced proliferation potential and the maintenance or enhancement of stemness under such clinorotation.30,32 In addition to the expression of genes that are indicative of an earlier stage of development, neonatal CPCs exhibited both a reduced capacity to readily form endothelial-like tubes, as evidenced by the absence of any tube-like structures being formed that are indicative of endothelial-potential,14,15 and decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (i.e., cardiomyocte, endothelium, and osteoblast) in response to spaceflight. Notably, the increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers may reflect the emerging hypothesis that this unique functional cell type develops from myocardium that retains its primitive phenotype.16 Accordingly, the concomitant increased expression of sinoatrial nodal genes and decreased expression of other mesodermal derivatives indicates that spaceflight promotes the modest de-differentiation of neonatal CPCs. Additionally, the elevated expression of Tbx proteins, particularly, Tbx3, overlaps with previous reports in the regulation of pre-mesoderm (i.e., mesendoderm) gene expression.33 This concomitant induction of mesendodermal markers and Tbx gene expression reflects the potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair. The critical role of the Tbx family in cardiac development has been well documented34 and its application to cellular therapies for cardiac repair is beginning to be explored. For example, SSEA-1+ early cardiovascular progenitors expressing T, TBX5, and TBX18, were shown to engraft into non-human primate myocardium following infarction.35 Meanwhile, Tbx5 and Tbx18 are expressed in highly migratory and proliferative proepicardial cell lineages.36,37 These studies have demonstrated an increasingly appreciated observation that Tbx expression is related to the engraftment and function of CPCs following transplantation. Beyond directing developmental events via alterations in intracellular signaling, disrupted cytoskeletal organization impacts migration. In other models, cytoskeletal re-organization induces the expression of CXCR4, the SDF-1α chemokine receptor.38 As seen in our experiments, both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited elevated expression of SDF1A, which correlates to the age-independent increase in migratory capacity of CPCs following spaceflight. Interestingly, the age-dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers. This trend was supported by the significantly increased cell cycle and proliferation patterns observed only in neonatal CPCs. Broad differences have already been reported to exist between adult and neonatal CPCs, including at the genetic/epigenetic12 and proteomic levels.39 In particular, the secretome of adult CPCs was found to exhibit a greater number of proteins related to anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis, and senescence. Meanwhile, the secretome of neonatal CPCs exhibited higher levels of telomerases as well as proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis.39 Similarly, we observed age-disparate responses to spaceflight in nearly all of these categories. In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated. Although the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well-controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.27 As humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered. Meanwhile, on Earth, we can further explore the therapeutic potential of these adaptations for cardiac repair.",

Copyright notice ID: 6062551 PMID: 30062101 Abstract The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.Stem cells: Spaceflight changes nature of heart progenitors Spaceflight alters the developmental status, proliferative potential and migratory ability of heart stem cells. Mary Kearns-Jonker from Loma Linda University, California, USA, and colleagues characterized the molecular expression profiles of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) obtained from neonatal and adult patients and then cultured them aboard the International Space Station for 12 days. They found that spaceflight impacted the expression of microRNAs and genes related to cell cycling, DNA repair and important signaling events in both populations of CPCs, but there were some important differences. Of note, only neonatal CPCs showed enhanced potential for certain regenerative processes following spaceflight. Understanding the molecular basis for the beneficial effects induced in neonatal CPCs by spaceflight and mimicking these effects on Earth may boost the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies. The findings also inform strategies to preserve the health of CPCs in astronauts as exploration of space expands in the future.Introduction Changes to the cardiovascular system during spaceflight have prompted molecular biologists to understand the mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to culture aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth. Recent research in our own laboratory has shown that neonatal human CPCs cultured under two-dimensional (2D) clinorotation, which approximates weightlessness by rotating the cell culture vessel about a horizontal axis, exhibit increased expression of markers of early cardiovascular development and pluripotency (i.e., MESP1, T (Brachyury), and OCT4) as well as broad changes to microRNA expression.1 The changes in microRNA expression experienced by CPCs in these experiments mirrored the expression of similar microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) under normal conditions of early cardiovascular development, thereby suggesting that such culture conditions induce an epigenetic environment that favors an earlier development status. Such a state appears increasingly beneficial for cardiovascular repair. For example, the efficacy of multipotent stem cells expressing Isl1+ and SSEA-1+ in ameliorating the symptoms of severe heart failure was recently demonstrated in one patient.2 Furthermore, KEGG analysis indicated that the microRNAs downregulated in CPCs in these experiments target several signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Wnt, which are relevant to well-characterized repair mechanisms or cardiac stem cell proliferation mechanisms in the heart. For example, non-canonical Wnt ligands (i.e., Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) have been shown to be associated with the injury response in neonatal rodent heart tissue.3 Therefore, our observations suggest that 2D clinorotation may foster a developmental state and signaling events that could enhance the use of CPCs for cardiovascular repair. This is supported by one recent study by Jha et al.4, which demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cells more readily differentiate into cardiomyocytes following three-dimensional (3D) (i.e., embryoid) culture under the influence of a random positioning machine. In the context of our previous findings, these experiments may highlight a potential phenomenon in which 2D clinorotation promotes an enhanced state of stemness that results in increased differentiation potential when the cells are returned to normal gravity conditions. It is currently believed that small RhoGTPases act as transducers of the mechanical alterations that are observed under conditions of spaceflight.5,6 As actors in the planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, they have central roles in cytoskeletal remodeling. Along with the Hippo pathway and calcium signaling, small RhoGTPases represent one potential molecular substrate of gravity sensing. Notably, in the context of cardiogenesis, these processes are central to maintaining multipotency or directing differentiation.7 Despite the early reports of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells, much is unknown about the mechanisms by which CPCs respond to spaceflight or how these cell types develop enhanced stemness. Hence, we are not yet able to leverage the therapeutic potential of spaceflight here on Earth. While current clinical trials to stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising,8–10 they are stymied by a failure of cells to engraft into the host tissue and by the use of progenitor types that are restricted in potency.11 Therefore, identifying the molecular events that promote enhanced stemness and regenerative potential in CPCs during spaceflight will benefit stem cell-based cardiac repair. The successful use of autologous CPC sources to regenerate heart tissue in a predominately adult population requires additional understanding of the differences between adult and neonatal CPCs. Our laboratory has previously documented differences in age-dependent expression of microRNAs related to MAPK signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction expression, and focal adhesion maintenance.12 The relationship between these processes and the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight remain unknown, but they imply deficits in the intracellular transduction of environmental cues in the functional shortcomings of adult CPCs. Therefore, in this study, clonal lines of neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the ISS. We sought to identify changes in these CPCs in response to spaceflight that impact signaling, development, and stemness. We then characterized the divergent response of neonatal and adult CPCs to spaceflight. In doing so, we present components of the adaptive cellular response to culture aboard the ISS and their implications for enhancing the regenerative potential of neonatal and adult CPCs.Results CPCs exhibit markers of early cardiovascular development CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Representative adult and neonatal clones are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig S1. Neonatal and adult CPCs are able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1b), endothelial cells (Fig. 1c), and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1d) when cultured using directed differentiation protocols (Fig. S2). Clonal lines of CPCs obtained from neonatal and adult patients were then flown aboard the ISS for 12 days and fixed in RNAprotect during orbit (Fig. S3). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Spaceflight alters microRNA expression in neonatal and adult early CPCs. Neonatal (blue) and adult (red) CPC clones were screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and then ultimately selected for experiments based upon the co-expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, KDR, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 a. Directed differentiation of these CPCs is able to induce cardiomyocytes b, endothelial cells c, and smooth muscle cells d. Neonatal and adult CPCs both exhibited significant alterations in microRNA expression following 12 days of culture aboard the ISS e. KEGG analysis (Table S1) indicated likely targeting of ECM interactions, membrane metabolism, and Hippo signaling by these microRNAs. n = 3 unique clones per age per group for all miRs, except miR-99a and miR100, which were measured in biological and technical triplicates. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001The spaceflight environment mediates changes to expression of microRNAs that target membrane synthesis and extracellular interactions In an effort to understand the relevant signaling events by which CPCs adapt to culture aboard the ISS, we performed microarray analysis to measure broad alterations to transcriptional control. Among both neonatal and adult CPCs, 14 microRNAs exhibited significant alterations in levels of expression (Fig. 1e). KEGG analysis by age group (Table S1) indicated that fatty acid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interactions, and Hippo signaling were the most significantly affected targets of these microRNAs.Cytoskeletal maintenance is altered in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after culture aboard the ISS Since the pathways targeted by the significantly dysregulated microRNAs affect cytoskeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction pathways (Fig. 2a), we sought to measure changes in the expression of YAP1, a gene involved in Hippo signaling; small RhoGTPases; and cytoskeletal molecules. YAP1 was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.24-fold, P < 0.01) and modestly upregulated in adult CPCs (2.6-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2b). This prompted us to assess the mechanosensitive small RhoGTPases, which indicated that only RHOA was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.15-fold, P < 0.05, Fig. 2c), which led us to assess the possible effects of spaceflight on cytoskeletal dysregulation. In doing so, we found that the cytoskeletal genes VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, and LMNA were all significantly upregulated (5.2-, 22-, 6-, 5.1-, and 10-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) following spaceflight (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, in adult CPCs, only NES expression decreased significantly (0.30-fold, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2d, f). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Spaceflight impacts expression of genes involved in mechanotransduction and cytoskeleton maintenance. Integrin and mechanical signaling impact Hippo activity and small RhoGTPases, which function along the Wnt planar cell polarity pathway a. YAP1 expression was significantly reduced in neonatal CPCs and upregulated in adult CPCs b. RHOA, a small RhoGTPase, was expressed at significantly lower levels in neonatal c, but not adult d, CPCs. Accordingly, cytoskeletal gene expression was significantly upregulated in neonatal e, but not adult f, CPCs. n = 3 biological replicates for all gene expression data, except YAP1 (n = 6 measures of three pooled clones). Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01Transcripts for non-canonical/Ca2+ signaling in neonatal CPCs are elevated during spaceflight Given the role of small RhoGTPases in non-canonical, planar cell polarity Wnt signaling and the impact of RhoA on regulating calcium signaling,13 we sought to assess the expression of genes involved in the canonical and calcium Wnt pathways. (Fig. 3a–f). We observed significantly increased expression of GSK3B (6.8-fold, P < 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3a) and significantly increased expression of CTNNB1 (1.9-fold, P < 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. 3d). Since Gsk3β sequesters β-catenin for degradation in the cytoplasm, thereby suggesting suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in neonatal CPCs and the promotion of canonical Wnt signaling in adult CPCs, we measured non-canonical Wnt ligand expression and that of genes in the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. We measured significantly increased WNT5A and WNT9A expression (36-fold and 17-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3b) and significantly decreased WNT9A expression (0.39-fold, P < 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. 3e). This was supported by significantly increased expression of PLCG1 and PRKCA (14-fold and 12-fold, respectively; P < 0.05) and a general increase in ITPR1 expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3c), but not adult CPCs (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway are expressed at higher levels along with mesendodermal markers in neonatal CPCs. Canonical Wnt signaling genes were measured in neonatal a and adult d CPCs along with non-canonical Wnt ligands b, e. Genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt/calcium pathway were elevated in neonatal c, but not adult f, CPCs. Markers of development were measured in neonatal and adult CPCs, which indicated elevation of early mesodermal markers (i.e., FOXC1, MESP1, and T) in the former and no changes in the latter population g. n = 3 unique clones per group. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05Neonatal CPCs exhibit increased expression of genes involved in pre-mesodermal development Calcium and Wnt signaling have central roles in cardiogenesis. For this reason, we sought to assess the transcription of markers of various stages of cardiac development. In doing so, we observed that the expression of genes involved in embryonic stem cell self-renewal (POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2), mesodermal specification (FOXC1, MESP1, T), and early cardiogenesis (GATA4, KIT, PDGFRA, ISL1, KDR) increased, while NKX2-5 expression decreased, in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 3g). In this population, the expression of genes involved in early mesodermal specification were the most significantly elevated. Conversely, adult CPCs generally exhibited decreased or unchanged expression of genes involved in early developmental processes (Fig. 3g).Expression of BMP4 and TBXs 3, 5, and 18 is elevated under ISS culture in neonatal CPCs These modifications to the expression of genes involved in cardiogenesis motivated us to measure the changes in the expression of genes in the Bmp, Smad, and Tbx families, which have important roles in pre- and early mesodermal development. We measured elevated expression of BMP4, TBX3, TBX5, and TBX18, and a general increase in BMP2 expression in neonatal CPCs (Fig. 4a). In adult CPCs, SMAD1 exhibited a significant increase in expression, while SMAD2 and TBX18 also trended towards an increase in expression (Fig. 4a). These findings indicate that the transcripts of genes involved in early pre-cardiac mesoderm development are upregulated by spaceflight in neonatal CPCs. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight reduces the propensity for neonatal CPCs to readily form endothelial-like tubes and express markers of terminal mesodermal derivatives. The expression of members of the BMP, Smad, and TBX families of genes was measured a and found to be elevated significantly in neonatal CPCs and modestly in adult CPCs. Following culture in biocells on the ground or the ISS for 30 days, CPCs were placed in endothelial growth media and incubated on Matrigel for 7 h to facilitate endothelial-like tube formation. The length of endothelial-like tubes formed b and the number of branches c were quantified using ImageJ for neonatal ground d and ISS e CPCs as well as for adult ground f and ISS g CPCs (ruler = 1000 µm). Changes in gene expression relevant to mesodermal derivatives were measured in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS for 12 days, indicating decreased expression of cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and osteogenic markers and increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers h. n = 3 unique clones per group for gene expression data; n = 3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay data. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, ***P < 0.001Spaceflight reduces terminal mesodermal derivative marker expression and endothelial-like tube formation in neonatal CPCs Given the elevated expression of early to pre-mesodermal genes in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs, we sought to measure whether spaceflight impacts the expression of CPC and other mesodermal derivative markers. First, following 30 days in orbit, CPCs were returned to Earth and assayed for endothelial-like tube formation using a widely accepted assay to assess the potency of progenitor cells with the capacity to form tube-like structures.14,15 However, endothelial-specific markers were not measured on space-flown CPCs in this assay. Unlike adult CPCs, neonatal CPCs exhibited a significantly reduced ability to form endothelial-like tubes (Fig. 4b, c). Representative images of endothelial-like tube formation of neonatal ground (Fig. 4d) and ISS (Fig. 4e) as well as adult ground (Fig. 4f) and ISS (Fig. 4g) samples reflect this age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. This impact of ISS culture on endothelial-like tube formation ability led us to measure the expression of markers of other derivatives: cardiomyocyte (TNNT2), endothelial (VWF), and osteoblast (RUNX2). These markers were all significantly reduced in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after 12 days in orbit. Since spaceflight induces pre-cardiac mesodermal marker expression, we sought to assess whether markers of the sinoatrial node, which may represent embryonic myocardium maintained in its primitive state,16 were modified. Indeed, the sinoatrial nodal markers HCN4 and SHOX2 exhibited elevated expression in neonatal CPCs and reduced expression in adult CPCs (Fig. 4h). Taken together, these findings indicate that spaceflight induces a pre-cardiac mesoderm gene expression profile in neonatal CPCs.ISS-cultured neonatal CPCs proliferate more rapidly than adult or ground-control CPCs Given the change in developmental status of the cell, we sought to assess whether such changes would affect the proliferative potential of space-flown CPCs; hence, cell cycling was assessed using flow cytometry. The Dean–Jett–Fox model was fitted to fluorescence intensity curves generated for propidium iodide-stained neonatal and adult CPCs (Fig. 5a). Adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 phase (ISS vs Ground: 71% vs 61%, P < 0.01) and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (ISS vs Ground: 14% vs 17%, P = 0.05) (Fig. 5b). Neonatal CPCs were more frequently in the G2/M phase both on the ground and following culture aboard the ISS. Interestingly, neonatal CPCs exhibited increases in CDKN2A (14-fold, P < 0.05), E2F1 (9-fold, P = 0.01), and PLK1 (8.5-fold, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5c). These modulators of cell cycling were not significantly altered in adult CPCs (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhanced TERT expression (Fig. 5e), was observed in neonatal (6.8-fold, P < 0.05) and adult (21-fold, P < 0.01) CPCs. Regardless of age, CPCs demonstrate enhanced proliferative potential aboard the ISS. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Cell cycling and proliferation are enhanced following spaceflight in neonatal CPCs. Following 30 days of culture aboard the ISS, CPCs were fixed, stained with propidium iodide, and measured using flow cytometry. The Dean–Jett–Fox model was then applied to the histogram of propidium iodide fluorescence intensity for ground-cultured and ISS-cultured CPCs a. Upon analysis b, adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. This was supported by increased expression of CDKN2A, E2F1, and PLK1, which function to regulate G1/S arrest, overcome G1/S arrests, and promote G2/M progression, respectively, in neonatal c, but not adult d, CPCs. Furthermore, increased telomerase activity, as indicated by enhanced TERT expression e, was observed in both groups. In addition to enhanced proliferation, DNA repair gene expression was induced in neonatal CPCs, as indicated by increased levels of ATM, RAD23, and RAD50 f. Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased DNA repair genes; however, only ATM expression was significantly increased g. n = 3 measurements of four pooled clones per group for cell cycling analysis; n = 3 unique clones per group for all gene expression data, except for E2F1, TERT, ATM, RAD23, and RAD50 (n = 9, three biological samples each measured in triplicate). Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001DNA repair transcripts increased following spaceflight The broad alterations experienced by CPCs and the possibility of exposure to radiation in the extraterrestrial environment prompted us to consider possible cellular stress response mechanisms, including the expression of DNA repair gene programs. In doing so, we measured increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, as indicated by elevated levels of ATM (11-fold, P < 0.05), RAD23 (7.9-fold, P < 0.001), and RAD50 (21-fold, P < 0.05) (Fig. 5f). Adult CPCs generally exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes (Fig. 5g); however, only ATM (24-fold, P = 0.001) expression was significantly elevated.Stress response, but not apoptosis, genes are induced in CPCs Given the broad induction of transcripts associated with DNA repair, we sought to characterize the impact of other stressors that could influence cellular function during spaceflight. Neonatal CPCs exhibited a 25-fold increase (P < 0.05) in NOTCH1 expression (Fig S4A, B), which confers protection as part of the adaptive cardiac stress response.17 In considering stress associated with spaceflight (Fig S4C, D),18,19,20 we found that HSP70 was elevated in both neonatal (12-fold, P < 0.01) and adult (20-fold, P < 0.05) CPCs, while TXNIP, TP53INP, and HMOX1 were all induced only in adult CPCs (21-fold, P < 0.01; 2.2-fold, P < 0.05; 3.2-fold, P < 0.001; respectively). Ultimately, neither adult nor neonatal CPCs exhibited an induction of transcripts associated with the apoptosis pathway (Fig S4E, F). Indeed, neither proliferation nor viability was reduced in either age group (Fig S5A, B).Adult and neonatal CPCs both exhibit a greater migratory capacity after ISS culture In addition to changes in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation, cytoskeletal alterations were anticipated to occur in response to spaceflight. For this reason, we measured the migratory capacity of ISS-cultured CPCs using a Transwell migration assay. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF-1α stimulation (neonate (ISS vs Ground): 2963 ± 15 cells vs 1972 ± 69 cells, P < 0.01; adult (ISS v Ground): 2247 ± 28 cells vs 1394 ± 52 cells, P < 0.001; Fig. 6a). Similarly, SDF1A expression was elevated in both neonatal (32-fold, P < 0.01, Fig. 6b) and adult (37-fold, P < 0.01, Fig. 6c) CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbit. VEGFA expression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs (16-fold, P < 0.01). Thus, CPCs, regardless of age, demonstrate enhanced migratory capacity aboard the ISS. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab CPCs have enhanced migratory capacity following spaceflight. Both neonatal and adult CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS migrated at significantly higher levels in response to SDF-1α stimulation a. Similarly, SDF1A expression was elevated in both neonatal and adult CPCs following exposure to low Earth orbit b, c. VEGFA expression was also significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs b, while most other paracrine and growth factors generally increased regardless of age. n = 5 measurements of four pooled clones per group for migration assay; n = 3 unique clones each measured in triplicate for gene expression experiments. Data are reported as the mean ± SEM, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001Discussion In this study, we found that spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, some of which occurred in an age-dependent manner. In particular, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity following culture aboard the ISS. Meanwhile, adult CPCs experienced little change in the expression of genes indicative of their developmental state, but exhibited changes to migratory capacity. These findings suggest that broad cytoskeletal modifications resulting from reduced mechanotransduction impart improved migratory and adhesion capabilities (Fig. 2a) regardless of age, but that neonatal CPCs are able to propagate or experience additional intracellular signaling events (e.g., calcium signaling) that modify their developmental status. As we have shown elsewhere, one important difference between adult and neonatal CPCs is their epigenetic (i.e., microRNA) environment.12 Several microRNAs were observed to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight in neonatal and adult CPCs. Interestingly, the predicted targets of these microRNAs included activators and repressors of several pathways. A detailed inspection of the putative targets under each pathway impacted by the microRNAs identified in this study revealed the targeting of genes relating to Wnt signaling (FZD3, FZD5, FZD7, FZD8), cytoskeletal regulation (ACTB, ACTG1, LAMC3), cardiovascular development (TGFBR1, BMP2, BMP5, SMAD7), integrin function (ITGB4, ITGAV), extracellular proteins (COL4A2, COL5A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL4A1), and Hippo signaling (TEAD1, YAP1, LATS1). Interestingly, miR-16, whose expression was generally elevated in neonatal CPCs and repressed in adult CPCs, directly targets YAP1, which could account, at least in part, for the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. However, since KEGG analysis only identifies broad categories of genes (i.e., functional categories) that are likely targets of the microRNAs under study, further experiments are warranted to identify the cumulative impact of these microRNAs on signaling in space-flown CPCs. These results motivated us to assess the overall impact of spaceflight on YAP1, an effector of Hippo signaling that functions with TAZ to regulate transcription. Activation of Hippo kinases, such as through a loss of microRNA-mediated repression or through reduced mechanical signaling, results in elevated levels of phosphorylated Yap1 and Taz. This prevents translocation of these transcriptional activators to the nucleus. Similarly, the application of 2D clinorotation to bone mesenchymal stem cells prevented TAZ translocation to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression of RUNX2 and inhibiting osteogenesis.21 Similarly, the decreased expression of YAP1 and RUNX2 observed in this experiment indicate that spaceflight reduces mechanotransduction in neonatal CPCs. In addition to broadly targeting the Hippo signaling pathway and ECM interactions, select microRNAs that were modified by culture aboard the ISS are known to be critically involved in cardiac development. For example, miR-142-3p is involved in targeting genes involved in early cardiac development, such as TBX5.22 Meanwhile, miR-302, which targets the type II BMP receptor to regulate early cardiogenic events, is repressed by Bmp4 in a Smad-dependent manner.23 Interestingly, we observed both reduced expression of miR-302c and elevated expression of BMP4 in CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS. Moreover, studies have demonstrated a direct mechanistic role of certain microRNAs in cardiac regeneration. As neonatal mice age, their cardiomyocytes lose their proliferative potential in a manner that is concomitant with increased let-7 family expression,24 thereby indicating a relationship between let-7 over-expression and reduced proliferative potential. Indeed, let-7c along with miR-99/100, which were significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs, are also critically downregulated during cardiomyocyte proliferation in a zebrafish model after ventricle amputation.25 As part of the amputation injury response, zebrafish cardiomyocytes near the site of injury undergo sarcomeric structure disassembly as a form of limited de-differentiation to prepare myocytes for self-renewal. PLK1, which was upregulated in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS, is involved in this process.26 Interestingly, these changes to the cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes and subsequent limited de-differentiation appears to resemble the effects of 2D clinorotation12,27 and spaceflight on CPCs. Our laboratory has previously measured changes in microRNA expression in neonatal CPCs induced by 2D clinorotation.12 In comparing those findings to the microRNA changes induced by culture aboard the ISS, we found miR-99a and -100 as well as members of the let-7 family, all of which are implicated in differentiation and developmental regulation, exhibit significantly reduced expression under both conditions. Additionally, we have previously compared the effects of spaceflight and 2D clinorotation on the induction of signaling in neonatal CCPs and observed similar activation of calcium and Akt signaling under both conditions. Similarly, both clinorotation and spaceflight induced a gene expression profile that was consistent with an earlier stage of cardiovascular development, and that mechanical signaling processes were involved, at least in part, in mediating these effects. When considered together, these findings indicate that both processes readily alter the developmental properties of neonatal CPCs, possibly through reduced mechanotransduction. Therefore, the recapitulation of spaceflight-induced signaling events using clinorotation may represent an avenue by which ongoing studies can be conducted. This comparative study also allows for the separation of effects due to cell culture stress from those due to mechanical unloading since 2D clinorotation, which utilized cell cultures that were maintained under ideal conditions, elicited a similar effect as spaceflight.27 Alterations to microRNA expression as well as changes to ECM interactions in ISS-cultured CPCs highlight the significance of the environment in directing differentiation. For example, a single population of mesenchymal stem cells can express neurogenic, myogenic, or osteogenic transcription factors when cultured on soft, moderately stiff, or stiff matrices, respectively.28 In our experiments, we observed elevated expression of mesendodermal-stage developmental markers in neonatal CPCs. It is likely that ECM interactions prompted cytoskeleton remodeling while modifying intracellular signaling pathways such that proliferation and stemness were enhanced. Similar experiments in different cell types involving clinorotation or a low Earth orbit cell culture system have demonstrated that such systems modify the differentiation potential of stem cells. Mouse ESCs flown as embryoid bodies during the Space Tissue Loss Experiment exhibited a decrease in the expression of markers of terminal germ layer derivatives while maintaining expression of stem cell renewal markers.29 However, upon return to Earth, these mouse ESCs differentiated more readily into colonies of contracting cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured under conditions of 2D or 3D clinorotation exhibit a reduction in the expression of markers of cartilage and osteoblast formation,30,31 while also demonstrating enhanced proliferation potential and the maintenance or enhancement of stemness under such clinorotation.30,32 In addition to the expression of genes that are indicative of an earlier stage of development, neonatal CPCs exhibited both a reduced capacity to readily form endothelial-like tubes, as evidenced by the absence of any tube-like structures being formed that are indicative of endothelial-potential,14,15 and decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (i.e., cardiomyocte, endothelium, and osteoblast) in response to spaceflight. Notably, the increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers may reflect the emerging hypothesis that this unique functional cell type develops from myocardium that retains its primitive phenotype.16 Accordingly, the concomitant increased expression of sinoatrial nodal genes and decreased expression of other mesodermal derivatives indicates that spaceflight promotes the modest de-differentiation of neonatal CPCs. Additionally, the elevated expression of Tbx proteins, particularly, Tbx3, overlaps with previous reports in the regulation of pre-mesoderm (i.e., mesendoderm) gene expression.33 This concomitant induction of mesendodermal markers and Tbx gene expression reflects the potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair. The critical role of the Tbx family in cardiac development has been well documented34 and its application to cellular therapies for cardiac repair is beginning to be explored. For example, SSEA-1+ early cardiovascular progenitors expressing T, TBX5, and TBX18, were shown to engraft into non-human primate myocardium following infarction.35 Meanwhile, Tbx5 and Tbx18 are expressed in highly migratory and proliferative proepicardial cell lineages.36,37 These studies have demonstrated an increasingly appreciated observation that Tbx expression is related to the engraftment and function of CPCs following transplantation. Beyond directing developmental events via alterations in intracellular signaling, disrupted cytoskeletal organization impacts migration. In other models, cytoskeletal re-organization induces the expression of CXCR4, the SDF-1α chemokine receptor.38 As seen in our experiments, both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited elevated expression of SDF1A, which correlates to the age-independent increase in migratory capacity of CPCs following spaceflight. Interestingly, the age-dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers. This trend was supported by the significantly increased cell cycle and proliferation patterns observed only in neonatal CPCs. Broad differences have already been reported to exist between adult and neonatal CPCs, including at the genetic/epigenetic12 and proteomic levels.39 In particular, the secretome of adult CPCs was found to exhibit a greater number of proteins related to anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis, and senescence. Meanwhile, the secretome of neonatal CPCs exhibited higher levels of telomerases as well as proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis.39 Similarly, we observed age-disparate responses to spaceflight in nearly all of these categories. In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated. Although the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well-controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.27 As humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered. Meanwhile, on Earth, we can further explore the therapeutic potential of these adaptations for cardiac repair.Methods Isolation and culture of early CPCs CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1 day–1 month) or adult (57–72 year old) human patients, as previously described.27 The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient-specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0 mm3) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1 mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40-µm cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion. Cells were then screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit. Clonal CPC cultures were selected for other markers of early cardiac development (KDR and PDGFRA) and then supplemented with growth media comprised of 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 µg/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 22% endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mycoplasma contamination was tested using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer’s protocol.Flow cytometry Progenitor cell populations were fluorescently labeled with antibodies, as recommended by their respective manufacturers. Briefly, for developmental marker detection, CPCs were incubated with Viobility 405/520 before being washed in 1 × PBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.5% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Then, CPCs were stained for cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (PDGFRα, CXCR4, c-Kit, and SSEA1). CPCs were then fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), blocked in 0.6 M glycine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution containing 10% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL), and stained for intracellular, cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (Isl1 and Mesp1). For directed differentiation assays, cells were stained for TropT after being fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or directly for vWF or SMA. Stained CPCs were then analyzed using a MACSQuant® analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Quantification of data was performed using FlowJo software version 10 (Ashland, OR). Compensation was performed using UltraComp eBeads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, one drop of compensation beads were incubated with each antibody individually for 30 min at 4 °C and then detected using the same MACSQuant® analyzer just prior to experiments requiring compensation. FlowJo was then used to generate a compensation matrix, which was applied to all experimental data. Information concerning antibodies, isotype controls, and reagents used in antibody labeling is provided in Table S2.Directed differentiation of CPCs To validate the ability of neonatal and adult CPCs to differentiate into cells of the cardiovascular lineage, directed differentiation assays were performed, as described in Le et al.40 and Smits et al.41 In brief, to generate cardiomyocytes, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent. CPC growth media was then replaced with differentiation media (47% IMDM, 47% Ham’s F12 with GlutaMAX, 2% penicillin–streptomycin, 2% horse serum, 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution, and 1% insulin-transferring selenium (all reagents from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 5 µM 5-Azacytidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)), which was refreshed daily for 3 days. Then, 1 ng/mL TGF-β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in fresh differentiation media was added routinely until day 14, at which time cells were stained for TropT or placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis. To generate endothelium, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 25 ng/mL Bmp4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 50 ng/mL Vegf (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 days. The media was then replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 50 ng/mL Vegf and cultured for 4 days. Then, cells were regularly fed endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) until day 14, at which time cells were stained for vWF, placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis, or seeded onto Matrigel for endothelial-like tube formation assay analysis, as described below. Finally, to generate smooth muscle cells, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 4.5 g/L d-glucose, 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 50 ng/mL PDGF-BB (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This media was regularly replaced until day 14, at which time cells were stained for smooth muscle actin or placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis.CPC culture aboard the ISS Neonatal and adult CPCs were seeded into Biocells (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO) at two seeding densities (7500 cells or 5000 cells) and loaded into self-contained environments containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The seeding conditions were carefully titrated on Earth to identify the most optimal conditions under which CPCs could be cultured over the course of the experiment. These conditions were then tested during an Experiment Verification Test, which was performed with BioServe Space Technologies ahead of the mission launch. They were then flown aboard SpaceX CRS-11 to the US National Lab on the ISS where they were placed in an incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fresh media was provided every 4 to 5 days while aboard the ISS (Fig S3). At 12 days, the Biocells that were seeded with 7500 cells were flooded with RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at −80 °C. At 30 days, the Biocells seeded with 5000 cells were fed and returned to Earth. Clone-matched and passage-matched ground controls were fed and treated in parallel with the feeding schedule and activities performed by astronauts aboard the ISS.Post-flight sample processing Upon landing and retrieval of the payload, live cells were trypsinized, counted, and used to assess cell cycle, migration, and endothelial-like tube formation, as well as to prepare protein lysates. Biocells containing cells fixed and frozen in RNAprotect were thawed at room temperature. The RNAprotect was removed and centrifuged at 10,000×g at 4 °C for 10 min. Biocells were disassembled and the culture membranes were then rinsed with TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was purified from the RNAprotect samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), per the manufacturer’s instructions, while total RNA was purified from TRIzol® reagent using isopropanol-based and ethanol-based precipitation. cDNA was generated and RT-PCR was performed as described below.RT2 microRNA profiler array and miRNA RT-PCR MicroRNA array profiling was performed as previously described.1 Briefly, the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to convert 500 ng of total RNA into cDNA, which was diluted, added to miScript SYBR Green PCR master mix and 10× universal primer mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and run on human development and differentiation miScript plates (MIHS-103ZA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fold changes were determined for each clone using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/) using all available housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two-tailed Student’s t-test to calculate P-values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below. Individual primers for SNORD96a, SNORD72, hsa-miR-100-5p, and hsa-miR-99a-5p (SABiosciences, Valencia CA) were also used (Table S2). The average Ct value of SNORD96a and SNORD72 was used as a housekeeping control. The PCR conditions for the microRNA arrays and individual microRNA assays were: 95 °C for 15 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 70 °C for 30 s. Differences in fold changes between ground-cultured and ISS-cultured CPCs were then analyzed as described in the statistics sub-section.MicroRNA targeting prediction KEGG analysis was performed using DIANA mirPath version 3 and TarBase v7.042 for microRNAs that were found to be significantly altered in neonatal and adult CPCs. Results were merged by pathway union after controlling for error rate due to multiple comparisons via selecting the “correct for FDR” feature. After removing categories related to cancer, neurological diseases, and viruses/pathogenesis, the KEGG categories whose P-values were <0.05 were reported.RT2 profiler array We used custom array plates (CLAH22469A; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions to measure gene expression changes in ISS-cultured adult and neonatal CPCs that were relevant to Wnt, ERK, BMP/Smad, and Notch signaling; cytoskeletal maintenance; calcium handling; apoptosis and cell cycle; cardiac development and stemness; and regeneration. Briefly, 2 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, as described above, and then thoroughly mixed with 2×RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix and RNase-free and DNase-free water before being loaded into the profiler array plate. Samples were amplified in the iCycler iQ™5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a protocol of 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Fold changes were determined for each clone individually using the Qiagen Data Analysis Center (http://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/) using GAPDH and ACTB (β-actin) as housekeeping genes. Since this analysis center performs only a two-tailed Student’s t-test to calculate P-values, all fold changes for individual clones were exported to Prism and analyzed, as described below.Quantitative RT-PCR Changes in the expression of select genes were analyzed using RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from CPCs as described above. cDNA was prepared using 2 µg of RNA with Superscript III (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using Go-Taq® qPCR Mastermix (Promega, Madison, WI) and the iCycler iQ™5 PCR Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following a protocol of 94 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 46-68 °C (depending on the primer) for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. RT-PCR products were visualized using 1%-2% agarose gel electrophoresis and low mass DNA ladder (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primers were designed using the  Primer-BLAST program and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primers used in experiments are listed in Table S2.Endothelial-like tube formation assay Matrigel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to a 96-well plate (50 μL/well) and hardened in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells (20,000 per well) were then incubated for seven hours in EGM-2 media (Lonza Allendale, NJ) before being stained with Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) for 30 min. Their ability to form capillary-like networks was measured using an EVOS imaging system (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and quantified with ImageJ (v1.47f, , Bethesda, MD).Cell cycle analysis Aliquots of 250,000 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, incubated for 60 min with RNAse A (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA), and stained with propidium iodide, prior to running samples on a MACSquant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and analyzing cell cycle progression using the Dean–Jett–Fox model in the cell cycle analysis tool of FlowJo software (Ashland, OR).Migration assay CPCs were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in starving medium that contained IMDM with GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1% Insulin–Transferrin–Selenium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.5% FBS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 50,000 CPCs were plated in the top chamber of a 96-well transwell migration assay (Corning, Union City, CA) with 8 μm pores. Standard CPC growth medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL of SDF-1α (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used in the bottom chamber as a chemoattractant. After 6 h, migrated cells in the bottom chamber were stained using Calcein AM (Fisher Scientific Pittsburg, PA) and quantified using a FLX800 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT).Statistical analysis The Shapiro–Wilk test for normality was used to test the normality of data distribution. We then performed a two-tailed, paired t-test to compare the mean of all normally distributed data. Non-normally distributed data were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank text. For cell cycle, migration, and endothelial-like tube formation assay, samples in each group were pooled and either a two-tailed, unpaired t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the mean of normally or non-normally distributed data, respectively. All data are reported as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. Prism 7 version 7.02 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for all statistical analyses. P-values < 0.05 were assumed to indicate statistical significance.Data availability Gene and microRNA expression data used in RT-PCR, custom array, and microarray experiments have been deposited in ’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE110563.43 Additional data relating to this publication are available upon request to the corresponding author.Electronic supplementary material Supplemental Files (1.1MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank Peggy Whitson for performing cell culture experiments aboard the ISS.

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Given the importance of ensuring the protection of humans from radiation injury, strong collaborations have been forged between U.S. Government funding agencies with mandates to develop products to protect, mitigate, and/or treat radiation-induced normal tissue injuries. There has been a strong track record of interactions between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - organizations that have been tasked with understanding mechanisms of radiation-induced biological damage and exploring pathways for the development of drugs to address radiation injuries. Past synergies have included co-sponsoring scientific meetings, co-funding research, and involvement through inter-agency grant/contract review teams and working groups. Several publications have resulted from these prior cooperative efforts (Carnell et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2014). In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was established between  and NASA1 to formalize interactions with each organization establishing areas of cooperation, including the “development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space.” NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also signed an interagency agreement in 2018 to share innovative ideas for addressing science and technology challenges and to coordinate and collaborate on research that could improve human health on Earth and in space.2 Finally, since 2017 the NIAID/NASA Medical Countermeasures Working Group, with representation from NCI and other parts of HHS, has endeavored to rapidly and continually share information concerning research advances, to accelerate activities for all agencies. Although the core mission of these organizations is similar, each directs research efforts toward the specific needs of its target human population. For example, NCI’s interest in radiation stems from the use of localized, high-dose, gamma, x-ray, or proton radiotherapy in cancer treatments. Since incidental damage to surrounding normal tissues can limit the amount of radiation therapy delivered to a tumor, developing approaches using short-term administration of radioprotectants that are not tumor-protective is essential (Prasanna et al., 2012). Additionally, since the time of radiation exposure is known during radiotherapy, it is possible to administer radioprotectors before irradiation. Similarly, NASA’s concern is the protection of astronauts who will be exposed to low dose but extended periods of irradiation with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as possible immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. These outcomes also represent concerns for late effects of irradiation similar following a course of radiotherapy or after unanticipated low-dose exposures during a radiation incident. Characterization and mitigation of these risks require a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) high charge and energy (HZE) exposures and validation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in a relevant space environment (Simonsen et al., 2020). Although exposure levels are much lower than those used in radiotherapy, the duration of exposure is far longer. The intent of using mitigators is to prevent and/or reduce late effects thought to be associated with chronic, low doses of radiation. Thus, it is necessary to have products that are safe when dosed continuously because the time during a spaceflight when a harmful exposure may occur can be difficult to predict. Finally, the mission of the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP) within the NIAID is to address radiation injuries following prompt, high-dose exposure of civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. Because it is impossible to predict when these exposures will occur, use of prophylactic (pre-exposure products is not feasible; therefore, drugs that can mitigate (given post-irradiation but before symptoms manifest) or treat (given after clinically detectable injury) are of greatest interest. Like the NCI, high doses of radiation are of concern; however, the exposures are anticipated to be nearly total-body. NIAID’s primary focus is on developing effective approaches to improve survival and reduce the risk of major morbidities. Clearly, given limited budgets available for radiation research, to maximize opportunities for synergy, it is incumbent on NASA, NCI, and NIAID to leverage investments across mission spaces when possible. In addition, with a limited number of radiation researchers, principal investigators are often involved in, and receive funding from, all three agencies to carry out research projects that have some overlap. To that end, the authors have attempted to identify radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and radiotherapies in their respective portfolios, to address NASA’s concerns in the care of astronauts exposed to radiation in long-duration space travel. It should be noted that the focus of the present work is on drugs with potential use to mitigate damage resulting from chronic, long-term exposures. Therefore, a discussion of approaches to minimize acute radiation syndrome (ARS) risks to astronauts from solar particle radiation is not considered in depth. A separate review addressing this area has been released by the NASA Human Research Program (National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2016). Furthermore, gaps in each mission space are identified herein, and the need for shared approaches across these organizations to address them.",

    "conclusion": "8. Conclusion There are several terrestrial-based radiation injury prevention products, either in routine clinical use or undergoing testing through other U.S. government programs such as NCI and NIAID, that could be used to address the health needs of humans in space and vice versa. Fortunately, careful coordination between funding agencies and scientists in the field has enabled the advancement of many approaches that could be useful for both  and NASA needs. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Although exposures may be limited due to shorter flight times, people in the general population will still be exposed to space radiation during these flights. As there are diverse tissue-specific cancer risk rankings across sex and race, including sex-specific organ risks, all of these factors will need to be considered as more people take these flights (Cucinotta and Saganti, 2022). Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies’ mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights.

Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts. Keywords: Space, Radiation, Medical countermeasures, Chronic, Cancer, Biomarkers1. Introduction Given the importance of ensuring the protection of humans from radiation injury, strong collaborations have been forged between U.S. Government funding agencies with mandates to develop products to protect, mitigate, and/or treat radiation-induced normal tissue injuries. There has been a strong track record of interactions between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - organizations that have been tasked with understanding mechanisms of radiation-induced biological damage and exploring pathways for the development of drugs to address radiation injuries. Past synergies have included co-sponsoring scientific meetings, co-funding research, and involvement through inter-agency grant/contract review teams and working groups. Several publications have resulted from these prior cooperative efforts (Carnell et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2014). In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was established between  and NASA1 to formalize interactions with each organization establishing areas of cooperation, including the “development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space.” NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also signed an interagency agreement in 2018 to share innovative ideas for addressing science and technology challenges and to coordinate and collaborate on research that could improve human health on Earth and in space.2 Finally, since 2017 the NIAID/NASA Medical Countermeasures Working Group, with representation from NCI and other parts of HHS, has endeavored to rapidly and continually share information concerning research advances, to accelerate activities for all agencies. Although the core mission of these organizations is similar, each directs research efforts toward the specific needs of its target human population. For example, NCI’s interest in radiation stems from the use of localized, high-dose, gamma, x-ray, or proton radiotherapy in cancer treatments. Since incidental damage to surrounding normal tissues can limit the amount of radiation therapy delivered to a tumor, developing approaches using short-term administration of radioprotectants that are not tumor-protective is essential (Prasanna et al., 2012). Additionally, since the time of radiation exposure is known during radiotherapy, it is possible to administer radioprotectors before irradiation. Similarly, NASA’s concern is the protection of astronauts who will be exposed to low dose but extended periods of irradiation with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as possible immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. These outcomes also represent concerns for late effects of irradiation similar following a course of radiotherapy or after unanticipated low-dose exposures during a radiation incident. Characterization and mitigation of these risks require a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) high charge and energy (HZE) exposures and validation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in a relevant space environment (Simonsen et al., 2020). Although exposure levels are much lower than those used in radiotherapy, the duration of exposure is far longer. The intent of using mitigators is to prevent and/or reduce late effects thought to be associated with chronic, low doses of radiation. Thus, it is necessary to have products that are safe when dosed continuously because the time during a spaceflight when a harmful exposure may occur can be difficult to predict. Finally, the mission of the Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP) within the NIAID is to address radiation injuries following prompt, high-dose exposure of civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. Because it is impossible to predict when these exposures will occur, use of prophylactic (pre-exposure products is not feasible; therefore, drugs that can mitigate (given post-irradiation but before symptoms manifest) or treat (given after clinically detectable injury) are of greatest interest. Like the NCI, high doses of radiation are of concern; however, the exposures are anticipated to be nearly total-body. NIAID’s primary focus is on developing effective approaches to improve survival and reduce the risk of major morbidities. Clearly, given limited budgets available for radiation research, to maximize opportunities for synergy, it is incumbent on NASA, NCI, and NIAID to leverage investments across mission spaces when possible. In addition, with a limited number of radiation researchers, principal investigators are often involved in, and receive funding from, all three agencies to carry out research projects that have some overlap. To that end, the authors have attempted to identify radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and radiotherapies in their respective portfolios, to address NASA’s concerns in the care of astronauts exposed to radiation in long-duration space travel. It should be noted that the focus of the present work is on drugs with potential use to mitigate damage resulting from chronic, long-term exposures. Therefore, a discussion of approaches to minimize acute radiation syndrome (ARS) risks to astronauts from solar particle radiation is not considered in depth. A separate review addressing this area has been released by the NASA Human Research Program (National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2016). Furthermore, gaps in each mission space are identified herein, and the need for shared approaches across these organizations to address them.2. Background The importance of MCM development and biomarker identification for both acute and long-term effects of radiation align with the missions of NIAID, NASA, and NCI (Fig. 1). NASA is concerned with acute exposures from solar particle events (SPEs), and delayed effects from these exposures could impact the quality of life for the crew upon returning to Earth. NASA is also interested in the bodily effects of prolonged exposure to space radiation during long missions. At the same time, NCI is concerned with roles of radiation in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. Charged with treating civilian casualties after a radiological or nuclear incident, NIAID’s efforts are focused primarily on the acute and delayed effects of high dose-irradiations to large portions of the body. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Areas of overlap between the missions of NASA, NIAID, and NCI.2.1. NASA NASA has identified five hazards to astronauts associated with long-duration, deep space exploration missions (radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, Gravity (or lack thereof), and hostile/closed environments). Three key radiation-associated risks have also been outlined: 1) carcinogenesis; 2) cardiovascular disease and other degenerative tissue effects; and 3) acute (in-flight) and late central nervous system effects (e.g., changes in cognition, motor function, behavior, or neurological disorders). These risks also align well with those of NIAID and NCI. The primary challenges for NASA are to understand the severity of these risks in a space-relevant environment, evaluate MCMs that may provide radioprotection or mitigation, and identify biomarkers to indicate if/when an MCM may need to be administered during a mission. It is also imperative to determine any proposed MCM’s dosage, delivery, storage, and shelf-life since many space missions will have limited payload and refrigeration capacity. Therefore, selecting critical-need pharmaceuticals and identifying biomarkers to determine the timing of intervention and avoid treatment-related toxicities will be paramount. Continued interactions with  programs exploring therapeutics for normal tissue injuries will provide new approaches to be considered for astronaut health in a radiation environment.2.2. NIAID The mission of NIAID’s RNCP is to support early to mid-stage research to develop MCMs and biodosimetry tools for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, with an emphasis on products to treat or mitigate radiation injuries when administered post-irradiation, radionuclide decorporation agents, and biodosimetry tools and biomarker discovery for triage and to predict biological impacts of exposure. Several of these topics represent areas of overlap with NCI and NASA (e.g., minimization of normal tissue injuries, and biomarker identification). Another area of focus for NIAID, and a shared interest of NASA and NCI are the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure, including lung complications. NIAID has funded intramural studies at NCI on long-term health outcomes resulting from chronic, lower dose irradiation, since people could spend significant time in a lower dose, fallout environment after a nuclear incident (Simon et al., 2022; Beck et al., 2022; Land et al., 2015; Drozdovitch et al., 2015). These findings can be used to anticipate potential outcomes following chronic exposures of NASA space flight personnel, and possible late effects in radiotherapy patients. In addition, the strong partnership between NIAID and NASA staff has helped both agencies to keep abreast of significant developments in each program, including exciting research findings and shared policy decisions.2.3. NCI More than 50% of cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy, often combined with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or surgery. Therefore, NCI’s Radiation Research Program (RRP) was established as a nexus for funding extramural research activities related to radiation therapy. Although dose prescriptions to a tumor or tissue are generally based on a population average, radiation therapy is now pursuing precision medicine and predictive oncology, where doses are individualized or stratified to a cohort (Coleman et al., 2018). Since many patients suffer from adverse treatment effects, which could be acute, intermediate, or late (Prasanna et al., 2012), the RRP has supported predictive biomarker development (Prasanna et al., 2020; Prasanna et al., 2014), along with radioprotectors and mitigators to reduce treatment-related toxicities and improve patient outcomes (Prasanna et al., 2015; Coleman et al., 2021). Cancer survivorship will expand with improvements in treatment, with one estimate suggesting >26 million cancer survivors by 2040 (Bluethmann et al., 2016). Establishment of tracking in these populations will provide an opportunity to study late radiation impacts, including second cancers (Singh et al., 2017) and cardiovascular disease (Spetz et al., 2018). Exploring outcomes in these patient populations can inform long-term impacts of continuous, lower doses of radiation exposure in individuals involved in NASA long space flights and provide insight into possible late effects in populations unexpectedly exposed to radiation during a public health emergency.3. Cross-cutting models and tools 3.1. Preclinical models A shared challenge in radiation research among agencies is replacing, reducing, and responsibly conducting animal research while identifying, and developing unproven therapies for human use. To address this requirement, many models have been established to look at terrestrial and space-based radiation, ranging from in vitro cell cultures, tissue chips, and invertebrates, to small (rodents) and large (nonhuman primates, dogs, minipigs, etc.) laboratory animals to humans. In addition, infrastructure for studying the effects of high-LET radiation exposures is limited and expensive, and thus a challenge when developing large animal models, so leveraging studies on these species in other radiation scenarios (such as radiotherapy in the clinic or unanticipated exposure during a radiological or nuclear incident) is essential. In many instances, researchers receive concurrent support from NASA, NCI, and NIAID, and can use the animal models they have developed to contribute meaningful data for all three agencies. The 2021 NASA trans-agency research announcement, “Extended Longevity of 3D Tissues and Microphysiological Systems (MPS) for Modeling Acute and Chronic Exposures to Stressors,3 represents an effort sponsored by NASA’s Space Biology Program, with the participation of NASA’s Human Research Program. Complex human in vitro models such as tissue chips or microphysiological systems (MPS) are three-dimensional (3D) systems constructed of cells grown on bioengineered platforms that mimic in vivo tissue architecture and physiological conditions. These platforms can incorporate complex in vivo factors, including extracellular scaffolding, 3D structures, cellular interactions, perfusion, biomechanical stresses, electrical stimulation, and hormone/inflammatory responses. The purpose of the announcement was to solicit research supporting common cross-organizational goals by focusing on adapting existing MPS to extend their longevity to at least six months, while thoroughly testing and validating the models for acute and chronic stressors. Contract awards reflect collaboration across multiple agencies including NCI and NIAID. Each participating organization has unique and specific applications for tissue-engineered models, yet they all identified common interests resulting in this multi-organizational effort, and the resulting research findings are expected to benefit all the mission spaces.3.2. Biomarkers of injury Biomarkers in biomedical research are integral to understanding disease pathogenesis and healing (Robb et al., 2016). Once biomarkers are identified, evaluated, and qualified, they can help bridge preclinical data across species and predict human clinical outcomes. As defined by the -FDA Biomarker Working Group in the joint document, BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Resource,4 biomarkers are indicators of normal biological and pathogenic processes or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutics (Robb et al., 2016). Biomarkers can be molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiologic characteristics and do not necessarily assess how a patient feels, functions, or survives (Califf, 2018). Molecular patterns, gene expression profiles, and miRNA signatures have been explored for possible use in radiation dose reconstruction, disease prognosis, prediction of radiation sensitivity, and use in medical triage. In addition, study of biomarkers to determine if and when MCMs should be administered during a radiation emergency also inform on exposures during a spaceflight mission, and may reduce the need to take prophylactic MCMs and allow appropriate medical intervention. Biomarkers could also help determine individual sensitivity from radiation exposure and guide both determination of fitness for radiation exposure (e.g., during therapy or space flight), and precise delivery of MCMs for each victim, radiotherapy patient or space crew member. To this end, NASA, NCI and NIAID have worked together to explore different models for radiation-induced injuries, such as hematopoietic (DiCarlo et al., 2019), cutaneous (DiCarlo et al., 2020), lung (Cassatt et al., 2022), and late carcinogenic endpoints (Yoo et al., 2014).3.3. Data mining/analytics Discovery and identification of areas of interest for generating leads to develop therapies will need to be accomplished by employing data analytics across numerous data sets. NASA’s GeneLab repository hosts space biology and related laboratory datasets and is utilized by multiple agencies worldwide. This interactive, open-access database allows scientists to upload, download, store, search, share, transfer, and analyze “omics” data from spaceflight and corresponding analog experiments. Although a vital shared resource, NASA does not have the volume of human flight data necessary to achieve statistical significance for many inquiries. Working with national and international communities to combine data in a central database will help develop new approaches. Fortunately, there is potential for collaboration with NCI, and NIAID in this area. The NCI Cancer Research Data Commons5 provides access to genomic, proteomic, comparative oncology, imaging, etc., in addition to data from NCI programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.6 These projects address several NCI challenges, including understanding molecular bases of crucial protein interactions, developing predictive models for drug response, and automating analysis and extraction of information from patient records to determine optimal treatment strategies.7 NCI staff are discussing with NASA program representatives ways to explore these databases for relevant information on radiation exposures of interest to both agencies. NIAID has developed the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort)8 resource, which provides experimental data, metadata, and analysis tools on basic and clinical immunology research that includes radiation information. ImmPort is open to the public for sharing research data and creates an integrated environment that broadens the use of scientific data and advances hypothesis-driven/generating research. There is currently an effort underway to connect ImmPort with NASA GeneLab and NCI repositories described above to provide researchers curated access to volumes of data that can be mined for future radiation studies.4. Knowledge gained from epidemiology studies addresses space risk assessment Radiation epidemiological health risk assessments conducted by the U.S. Government have included studies of Japanese A-bomb survivors and humans exposed during nuclear emergencies, occupational exposure cohorts, astronauts, populations living in high background radiation areas, and nuclear medicine and radiotherapy patients (Ali et al., 2020). For example, cancer risks in the A-bomb lifespan study cohort continue to rise throughout life (Ozasa et al., 2012); however, clearly defining carcinogenic risks from low-dose irradiation has been challenging A literature review published by NCI researchers within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics considered studies with mean radiation doses less than 100 mGy and found an excess relative risk of greater than 1.0 for most solid cancers and leukemia (Berrington de Gonzalez et al., 2020). This is consistent with the recent million-person study of U.S. radiation workers and atomic veterans that suggests leukemia and lung cancer risks are lower from chronic than acute exposures, and that low-level radiation exposures are associated with circulatory diseases (Little et al., 2012). NIAID has supported epidemiology work carried out by NCI researchers on health effects in Marshall Islanders exposed to the fallout following the Castle Bravo nuclear test (Simon et al., 2022), individuals exposed during Nevada Atomic Testing (Beck et al., 2022), and the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site (Land et al., 2015), and exposed populations living near Chernobyl (Drozdovitch et al., 2015). These studies have contributed to a better understanding of how persistent, low-dose exposures can be harmful. Because it is difficult to assess the long-term impact of space radiation on flight personnel, these studies assessing late effects resulting from exposure to other forms of radiation provide insight into what could be experienced by astronauts after returning from long duration space missions. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory has been expanded through development of a galactic cosmic rays (GCR) facility designed to provide a mixed spectrum of ion beams to simulate the space radiation environment (Simonsen et al., 2020). NSRL provides researchers the ability to conduct high-LET, mixed field radiation studies on the ground, to better understand space radiation effects on biology. understand space radiation effects and perform long-terms animal studies under controlled conditions. While NSRL can provide access to high-LET mixed field exposures, the dose-rate expected in space is significantly lower than the facility can provide, hence, the ideal exposure scenario will be conducted on future Artemis missions designed to take astronauts to the lunar surface, Gateway, and beyond.5. Repurposing licensed products Inherent to NASA’s challenges in developing MCMs for use in space is the need to minimize the mass of carried products. For this reason, it is of great interest for potential radiation MCMs to have multiple space crew uses. The ideal drug, for example, will provide cross-protection through antioxidants that provide free radical scavenging, common pathways (e.g., inflammatory), or other biological pathways that intersects multiple risks. If an MCM were able to be used as a radioprotectant in addition to another health indication, that kind of repurposing would be desirable. Both  and NASA have prioritized repurposing of products for other clinical indications so that a large body of safety and efficacy in humans physician familiarity can be leveraged. In the case of NASA, a product’s approval status can inform on its safe extended use in the space environment and accelerate the timeline for transition to operations. A 2017 meeting held by NIAID on this topic outlined several already licensed drugs that could be considered as radiation treatment approaches (DiCarlo et al., 2018). In addition, a 2017 review of the potential for the use of common drugs to protect during spaceflight has reviewed in more detail several of the approaches discussed below (McLaughlin et al., 2017).6. Overlapping mechanisms of radiation injury drug classes with space mission utility In leveraging investments by the  in approaches of potential interest to NASA, it is essential to note that such treatments may need to be administered over time frames of months to years to ensure that protection was consistent throughout, for example, an extended space flight mission to Mars. For that reason, products that are known to be safe with extended dosing provide the most appropriate selections for further study. Many approaches with these known long-term safety profiles fall into the general category of nutraceuticals. However, several products in constant and daily use by individuals worldwide also fall into this category (e.g., antibiotics, analgesics, anti-hypertensives). Although several products detailed below were initially tested in a high-dose, terrestrial irradiation setting, some have also shown promise for more chronic, lower-dose, and dose-rate irradiation exposures, and have demonstrated benefits in a space-irradiation context. These selected approaches that have received NASA and/or prior  funding are discussed below and outlined in Table 1. Table 1. Candidate ground-based MCM approaches with potential NASA chronic exposure interest. Research on many drugs shown in the table has been supported by multiple U.S. government organizations, enabling limited funding to be used to leverage research results across radiation mission spaces.

Anti-oxidants Under physiological conditions, low reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are produced due to normal cellular processes. ROS existing as free oxygen or nitrogen oxide radicals primarily function as signaling molecules that induce cell differentiation and apoptosis, among other activities. However, exposure to stressors such as radiation can trigger an imbalance in free radical generation and their removal, leading to DNA damage (Jakubczyk et al., 2020), with the potential to induce early and late effects (Hoorelbeke et al., 2020). It has been established that radiation exposure in all its forms leads to an immediate and chronic state of oxidative stress. The interaction of radiation with water molecules within the body leads to ROS generation, which, although short-lived, can wreak cellular havoc (Simone et al., 2009). Similarly, a chronic state of radiation-induced oxidative stress (Riley, 1994) can lead to altered homeostasis, which can continue for many hours to months beyond initial exposure (Azzam et al., 2012). This oxidant injury is non-specific, with all intracellular elements (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) subject to the damage. For this reason, antioxidant approaches have been investigated to modulate radiation-induced intracellular perturbations. Several popular candidates include nutraceuticals (e.g., vitamins (Changizi et al., 2019; Sihver and Mortazavi, 2021; Singh et al., 2013), melatonin (Kumar et al., 2022), flavonoids (Landauer et al., 2019), and other dietary approaches (e.g., curcumin (Amini et al., 2018; Jelveh et al., 2013), and flaxseed (Christofidou-Solomidou et al., 2011). This predominantly “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) class of products has volumes of safety data and known low toxicity. Such products may be amenable to NASA since they could be easily included in the essential diet of a space traveler. 6.1.1. Nutraceuticals/dietary modifications Several vitamin approaches mentioned above are covered in detail in another paper in this issue (Singh et al.). Dietary supplementation with Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors derived from soybeans (Shaghagi et al., 2021; Kennedy, 2021), L-selenomethionine, or a combination of selected antioxidant agents (Guan et al., 2004; Kennedy et al., 2007) has shown promise to prevent the decrease in antioxidants in the plasma of mice exposed to proton or HZE particle radiation. Adding nutritional foods, such as blueberries, to crew diets may provide added benefits to help reduce ROS and mitigate radiation-induced CNS effects, as reported in animal studies using space-relevant radiation exposures (Poulose et al., 2017). In one study, feeding dried plums to mice mitigated radiation-induced loss of bone and demonstrated potential as a radiomitigator for protons and HZE particle radiation (Schreurs et al., 2016). Flaxseed is bioactive lignin that is both an antioxidant/anti-inflammatory signaling agent (Turowski et al., 2015). It has been in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer to protect normal tissue (NCT00955942) and manage cardiovascular risk and hypotension (Berman et al., 2013). NASA recently funded a Phase II SBIR study to investigate the potential of LGM-2605, synthetic flaxseed, as a potential prophylactic radioprotector from the mixed field and GCR effects (described in greater detail below) (Chatterjee et al., 2019).6.1.2. LGM2605 LGM2605 (LignaMed, Philadelphia, PA) is a synthetic form of a natural component typically found in dietary flaxseed; thus, its excellent safety profile is well-established. Initially studied in cell-free (Mishra et al., 2014) and in vitro models of radiation injuries (Chatterjee et al., 2019), it became apparent that the radiation protection offered by the product (and its dietary-derived precursors) was significant. Later in vivo work focused on mitigation of radiation-induced lung injuries (Lee et al., 2009; Christofidou-Solomidou et al., 2011), and an ex vivo organ culture model of human lungs showed protection against proton irradiation (Velalopoulou et al., 2017). Of importance is the finding that the drug could reduce tissue injuries from exposure to radiation with high relevance to NASA, where it demonstrated the ability to blunt high-LET radiation-induced activation of the inflammasome in a lung vascular model (Chatterjee et al., 2019). Therefore, this product seems to be a reasonable option for NASA’s consideration.6.1.3. Enterade The University of Florida, which first created the Gatorade sports drink, also recently developed another nutritional plant-based drink for cancer patients, Enterade. It is a commercially available amino acid-based oral rehydration fluid that has been shown to alleviate GI complications experienced by patients undergoing chemo- and/or radiation therapy (De Filipp et al., 2021). Preclinical studies have also shown that Enterade can reverse radiation-induced injury that leads to a breakdown in GI structure (Gupta et al., 2020), increase weight gain and provide a survival benefit in mice (Yin et al., 2014). It has also been studied with funding from the National Space Biomedical Research Institute in experiments that found that the drink given as a daily gavage improved electrolyte balance and GI absorption of nutrients in irradiated animals (Yin et al., 2016).6.1.4. Ketones A method for reducing free radical damage occurs through the metabolism of ketone bodies. Elevated levels of ketone bodies can be pathological in disorders such as diabetes or maybe the result of a diet low in carbohydrates. Ketone ester has been evaluated as a dietary supplement to address oxygen toxicity (Stavitzski et al., 2021) and is considered by the FDA to fall into the GRAS category (Veech et al., 2017). A novel ketone ester product has been tested for efficacy in preclinical studies in mice for hematopoietic ARS. It is hypothesized that ketone esters can protect hematopoietic tissue and thus improve chances of survival in the animals by quenching the cascade of free radicals induced by ionizing radiation.9 Use of ketones in cancer therapies has also been reviewed (Klement, 2018), where its use has been linked to a lower incidence of normal tissue injuries during radiation therapy.6.1.5. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics SOD mimetics, such as Mn porphyrins, can have diverse reaction potentials in vivo and modulate cellular redox regulatory signaling networks (Batinic-Haberle and ME, 2019). They have been shown to have different effects on cancerous versus normal cells (Batinic-Haberle et al., 2018). One of these compounds, BMX-001, is being developed as a radioprotector to prevent normal tissue damage during cancer treatments. The drug is undergoing a clinical trial for patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer going through radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin (National Clinical Trial (NCT) 02,990,468) and also as a neuroprotector for patients with gliomas receiving radiotherapy plus temozolomide to protect against cognitive deterioration and improve survival (NCT02655601) (Zakeri et al., 2019). Similarly, another small molecule, SOD mimetic, GC4419 (Avasopasem manganese), is being developed to prevent radiation-induced toxicities. The product recently completed two clinical trials to mitigate severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy and cisplatin (NCT01921426, NCT02508389) (Anderson et al., 2018), where it reduced incidence, duration, and severity of oral mucositis without interfering with anticancer efficacy of the radiotherapy. Additional information on the Galera compound can be found in another manuscript in this special issue journal (Beardsley et al., 2022). BIO300 - a synthetic flavonoid (genistein) nano-formulation of a SOD mimetic - is a promising MCM being developed as a mitigator of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and late lung complications (Singh and Seed, 2020). Initially supported by DoD, the product has been tested in patients undergoing radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02567799) to mitigate pneumonitis and fibrosis (Prasanna et al., 2015; Day et al., 2008; Citrin et al., 2017; Zakeri et al., 2019). The product is currently being tested in COVID-19 patients with post-hospitalization lung complications (NCT 04,482,595). Finally, the SOD mimetic AEOL 10,150 received U.S. government funding to inform its use as a mitigator of radiation-induced lung damage. The compound, also a Mn porphyrin, is protective in mouse (Murigi et al., 2015), hamster (Sonis, 2001), and nonhuman primate (NHP) (MacVittie et al., 2017; Garofalo et al., 2014) models of radiation injury, with a proposed mechanism of action that involves reduction of innate immune response (Cui et al., 2021). Key to the potential use of this product in a space flight environment is the lack of toxicity observed in preclinical models despite continuous dosing over several months (MacVittie et al., 2017).6.1.6. Tempol Another antioxidant agent that could also double as a dietary supplement is a stable, water-soluble nitroxide free radical (Hahn et al., 1992). Tempol as a radio-protector and mitigator has been studied for radiation oncology indications (Hahn et al., 1994), where it has been shown to have antioxidant activity in the protection of normal tissues and as a mitigator of late radiation-induced carcinogenesis known to arise after lower doses of exposure in a mouse model of injury (Mitchell et al., 2012). It is a viable option for long-term administration, having been delivered to irradiated and unirradiated preclinical models across their entire lifespan with no adverse outcomes.6.2. Anti-inflammatories (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs) Along with chronic oxidative stress, chronic inflammation has been identified as a critical pathway in the development of cancer and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases. For this reason, anti-inflammatories are addressed here as potential therapies of interest to NASA. 6.2.1. Aspirin Researchers have reported that long-term use of aspirin significantly impacts cancer incidence and mortality (Qiao et al., 2018). Aspirin also reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events by ~20% in the general population and high-risk groups (Mitrugno et al., 2017; Camara Planek et al., 2020). NASA has examined aspirin’s efficacy in reducing radiation-induced cancers, and cardiovascular, immune, and behavioral health effects. For example, in a human gastrointestinal (GI) cancer model, mice exposed to 28Si-ions and a diet supplemented with aspirin reported a significant reduction in a potent pro-inflammatory molecule but not a reduction in GI tumorigenesis (Suman et al., 2021). Another study assessed the ability of aspirin to protect mice exposed to a mixed field of neutrons and photons and a single or fractionated simulated GCR exposure (Holden et al., 2021). While data suggested that radiation-induced changes in systolic cardiac function and mitochondrial respiration were mitigated, aspirin did not benefit in preserving behavioral or cognitive performance. A significant risk associated with regular aspirin intake is GI bleeding; however, there is a lower risk of GI bleeding-associated morbidity and mortality in individuals younger than 65 years (Patrignani and Patrono, 2016), which correlates to the NASA astronaut age range.6.2.2. Celecoxib Another easily accessible anti-inflammatory, celecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor), has also shown success in mitigating lung injuries following irradiation (Hunter et al., 2013). The drug reduced lung toxicity when given to irradiated mice twice daily over 40 days. In addition, COX-2 inhibitors are being studied in humans undergoing thoracic irradiation (Gore, 2004). Because this drug is known to be safe in humans in a long-term dosing scenario, along with its use to relieve joint injuries, it represents a product that could be useful to protect astronauts from space radiation.6.2.3. CDDO-Me Some NSAIDs can affect tumors and the tumor microenvironment by blocking cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis but have been implicated in adverse cardiovascular events (Varga et al., 2017). Other anti-inflammatory agents, such as CDDO-Me (bardoxolone methyl), act on the Nrf2 pathway, thereby upregulating an antioxidant response. CDDO-Me has demonstrated positive results in reducing tumor induction when tested in space radiation-simulated environments (Eskiocak et al., 2010), and protecting normal breast and lung cells from cesium irradiation (El-Ashmawy et al., 2014). The CDDO-ME compound was tested in several clinical trials, primarily for kidney (NCT03918447) and lung (NCT02036970) diseases, and also recently in COVID-19 patients (NCT04494646). The drug (an oral capsule) was safe and well-tolerated in these clinical studies. These agents, while promising, present challenges with the possibility of exacerbating cardiovascular events similar to over-the-counter NSAIDs and should be evaluated carefully for unintentional side effects. More information on this molecule can be found elsewhere in this special issue (Fornace & Shay).6.3. Anti-apoptotics A direct consequence of radiation damage is cellular apoptosis, also called programmed cell death or interphase death since cells usually die during interphase within a few hours of irradiation. The loss of normal nuclear structure and DNA degradation characterizes apoptosis, which occurs among various cell types at higher radiation doses (Little, 2003); however, it can be induced by relatively low doses of radiation in some cells (Xin et al., 2014). Products that modulate cellular apoptotic pathways have been tested with NIAID (and in some cases, NCI and NASA) support, demonstrating preclinical efficacy for ARS. These include a modified monoclonal anti-ceramide antibody approach (CX-01) (Rotolo et al., 2012), a GS-nitroxide (JP4–039) (Goff et al., 2011), and a pre-implantation factor therapy (sPIF) (Shainer et al., 2016). Although these drugs were tested in high-dose irradiation animal models, and their safety in a long-term use scenario is unknown, they represent novel compounds that could impact outcomes of NASA interest after low dose irradiation.6.4. Senotherapeutics Senescence is a process in which cells lose their proliferative capacity but remain metabolically active. Senescent cells display specific molecular, biochemical, and morphological features, and cancer treatments such as radiation (Shao et al., 2014) and chemotherapy (Ewald et al., 2010) induce senescence in both normal and cancer cells. Because of an increased understanding of multiple roles in cancer, cellular senescence is a vital target in the fight against cancer (Prasanna et al., 2021). Similarly, the role of senescent cells in radiation-associated aging of hematopoietic stem cells has led to the study of senolytic drugs as potential MCMs for ARS (Chang et al., 2016). While senescence is an essential tumor-suppressive phenomenon, senescent cells share hallmark features with cancer cells, including developing resistance to therapy, evasion of immune surveillance, and genomic instability. Thus, shared vulnerabilities of senescent cells with cancer cells could be exploited to develop novel approaches to prevent and mitigate carcinogenesis. A summary of senotherapeutics, including drug classes and developmental stage, mechanisms of action, critical knowledge gaps, pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities in their development as anticancer agents is available (Prasanna et al., 2021), and  has identified several broad areas as a blueprint in senescence research (Roy et al., 2020). In the context of radiation, the effects of dose, dose rate, radiation type, and the response kinetics of cellular senescence have not been fully understood.6.5. Statins Statins are a class of drugs commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. They offer cross-risk mitigation due to their pleiotropic effects that target neuroprotection, antioxidant modulation, and effects on anti-inflammatory pathways. In studies where atorvastatin was delivered chronically, there was minimal radiation mitigation; however, when combined with an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), the two drugs mitigated radiation-induced disruption of neurogenic signaling (Jenrow et al., 2011). Other studies found that lovastatin could interfere with the development of lung complications after large doses of irradiation (Williams et al., 2004), and mitigate radiation-induced damage to the salivary gland in murine models (Xu et al., 2016). Simvastatin is undergoing clinical trial testing in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases, as a means of neuroprotection (NCT02104193). Available human data on statins suggests a radioprotective mechanism in reducing GI toxicity (Wedlake et al., 2012); however, a Danish study looking at the risk of statin use reported an increase in ovarian mucinous tumors associated with their use (Baandrup et al., 2015). In addition, there is an established link between adverse side effects and statin use, which could interfere with the ability of NASA personnel to carry out flight tasks.10 Nevertheless, given the benefits and proven long-term use of statins, NASA could consider this MCM when planning studies to evaluate radioprotectors and mitigators.6.6. ACE inhibitors The ability of ACE inhibitors to serve as radiation mitigators has been well described in studies reaching back to the 1980s (Ward et al., 1988). These products, licensed as anti-hypertensives, are used extensively in humans, so their safety profile, even with chronic use, has been well-characterized (Sidorenkov and Navis, 2014). A variety of ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, captopril, enalapril, ramipril, etc.) have shown efficacy in mitigating high-dose radiation injuries to the lungs (Kma et al., 2012; Medhora et al., 2012), kidneys (Moulder et al., 2014; Moulder et al., 2011), and other organs (Kohl et al., 2007; Jenrow et al., 2010). These products could be beneficial in the space environment, even at low doses, to interfere with injury processes induced by irradiation in these tissues.6.7. Antibiotics Antibiotics have been tested in acute radiation exposure scenarios. They have demonstrated efficacy in attenuating ARS, with antimicrobials such as tetracyclines (Kim et al., 2009; Epperly et al., 2010) and fluoroquinolones (Kim et al., 2009) showing promise as radiation mitigators. Antibiotics such as minocycline are also in clinical trials as neuroprotective treatments for patients undergoing metastatic brain tumor radiotherapy (Afshari et al., 2020). Further, NASA has investigated use of minocycline as a prophylactic MCM due to its antibiotic, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties (Mehrotra et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). A second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been used clinically for decades, minocycline is considered a safe drug in humans (Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013). Work performed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) showed that ciprofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, improved survival and diminished symptoms in irradiated mice. It also improved neutrophil counts and function (Booth et al., 2012). In addition, ciprofloxacin enhanced recovery from hemorrhagic radiation proctitis in radiotherapy patients (Sahakitrungruang et al., 2011). Therefore, ciprofloxacin, with its ability to comprehensively modulate inflammation, immune signaling, and wound healing, has potential to mitigate radiation injuries arising from space-based exposures. Although this MCM could offer cross-risk protection for radiation-induced effects and the immune system to mitigate infection, it has been reported to increase intracranial hypertension (Milanlioglu and Torlak, 2011), which would not be acceptable for the crew since this complication is a risk outlined in the Human Research Roadmap. NASA should explore discussions with Human Health and Countermeasure (HHC) experts regarding this issue and investigate doses associated with intracranial hypertension.7. Regulatory considerations 7.1. Working with the FDA for product approval Understanding regulatory compliance is essential to successful development of products to address radiation normal tissue injuries, whether from planned (e.g., radiotherapy), unplanned (e.g., during a public health emergency) or contingent (space flight) exposure. The FDA is the U.S. regulatory agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Working within these regulatory guidelines, NIAID and NCI support research to develop therapeutics for FDA approval, whereas NASA has other mechanisms to allow for approval of products for administration to space flight personnel. Despite this different process, there is information to be gained by NASA through understanding the standard, NCI approach for therapies and the NIAID use of the FDA Animal Rule (21 CFR 314.600–650 for drugs; 21 CFR 601.90–95 for biologics), which was heavily influenced by the traditional clinical approval pathways used by NCI, and covers MCMs for which “human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible” (Food and Drug Administration, 2015). Please see the manuscript by Chang et al. elsewhere in this special issue for additional information about this unique regulatory pathway for MCM development.7.2. NASA’s regulatory approach Given NASA’s unique environment, it is not feasible to perform experiments representative of what astronauts will be exposed to during space travel, and epidemiology provides minimal information. The level of FDA approval required for the NASA crew is determined by the NASA Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer. If an MCM shows promise as a radioprotector or a mitigator, it goes through the NASA Transition to Operations Review Process (TORP) to obtain approval for administration to crew for the demonstrated indication.11 Similar to, and in many ways patterned on FDA procedures, the TORP is designed to assess effectiveness and operational readiness of human health, human performance, and medical research and technology products and deliverables. These reviews require 1) a detailed description of the deliverable, its intended use, and a description of how it addresses a NASA-identified critical risk, medical, health, performance issues, or application; 2) data demonstrating efficacy or utility; 3) data demonstrating operational validation; 4) an implementation plan of how it is to be used or applied, 5) an analysis of mission resources necessary for implementation; and 6) a summary of developmental processes and milestones achieved. Similar to FDA Animal Rule approval, the NASA pathway requires extensive evidence in animal models, clinical safety data in humans and takes cues from the development of other radio-therapeutics, and is also based on traditional clinical approval processes used for NCI approaches.8. Conclusion There are several terrestrial-based radiation injury prevention products, either in routine clinical use or undergoing testing through other U.S. government programs such as NCI and NIAID, that could be used to address the health needs of humans in space and vice versa. Fortunately, careful coordination between funding agencies and scientists in the field has enabled the advancement of many approaches that could be useful for both  and NASA needs. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Although exposures may be limited due to shorter flight times, people in the general population will still be exposed to space radiation during these flights. As there are diverse tissue-specific cancer risk rankings across sex and race, including sex-specific organ risks, all of these factors will need to be considered as more people take these flights (Cucinotta and Saganti, 2022). Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies’ mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights. Similarly, advances made by NASA and their funded investigators can help  in their efforts to address radiotherapy complications and protection of civilians from other unintended radiation exposures.Funding support Author salaries were supported by NASA’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division, NIAID’s RNCP, and NCI’s RRP.

    "abstract": "Abstract Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms. Keywords: International Space Station (ISS), Enterococcus faecalis, pangenome, antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, pathogenicity",
    "introduction": "Introduction Enterococcus faecalis represent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment. Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (∼425 million years ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus (Lebreton et al., 2017). Supporting that proposition, enterococci display significantly higher levels of resistance to a variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and starvation than ancestral outgroups (Lebreton et al., 2017). Because traits contributing to environmental persistence also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment, enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated infections (Weiner et al., 2016). While certain strains of E. faecalis are pathogenic for hospitalized patients, e.g., MMH594 (Huycke et al., 1991) and V583 (Sahm et al., 1989), and possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates are 25% smaller, as typified by the strain OG1RF (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci (Fiore et al., 2019). Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors (Shankar et al., 2002), however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined. The ISS provides a unique opportunity to study the establishment of a microbiome in what originated as a clean, hermetically sealed built environment, where the influx of new microorganisms only occurs periodically with the arrival of new crew and supplies. The microbiome of the ISS has been extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic (Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018b; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Blaustein et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019) and culture-based investigations (Schiwon et al., 2013; Venkateswaran, 2017; Singh et al., 2018a; Blaustein et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019), yet only recently have these effort been combined (Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019). The results are divided among those that report similarities to Earth built environments (Schiwon et al., 2013; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019) including United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (Be et al., 2017), and those that detected significant differences from terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project (Lang et al., 2017), the Japan-based ISS analog module (Ichijo et al., 2016), and a French Guiana-based cleanroom (Mora et al., 2019). Despite the differences in methodologies and results, the detection of opportunistic human pathogens (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Sielaff et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019) including E. faecalis, is a common phenomenon. With the exception of Be et al. (2017), the previous metagenomic efforts were limited to characterizing diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution to confidently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed for Staphylococcus aureus (Blaustein et al., 2019) and Enterobacter bugandensis (Singh et al., 2018a), only a single culture-based report has quantified pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporum isolates from the ISS Urbaniak et al., 2019) in a host model. As a result, the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact crew health remains unclear. In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS, understanding the effects of spaceflight on bacterial physiology will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was exposed to spaceflight, there was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass, biofilm thickness, and the cells produced a unique biofilm architecture not seen in ground controls of the species (Mclean et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2013). Su et al. (2014) documented growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and conversion) in Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens during spaceflight (Wang et al., 2014). Carbon utilization profiles were altered among S. marcescens clones after flight, and transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed significant changes in metabolic functions (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, Wilson et al. (2007) utilized proteomic analysis and expression profiles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation of Salmonella typhymurium were widely distributed, and virulence was increased in response to spaceflight. Although Hammond et al. (2013) report a significant decrease in E. faecalis OG1RF virulence when grown under spaceflight conditions, this was inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures grown in the presence of adult Caenorhabditis elegans rather than worm viability. In addition to altered microbial physiological responses, astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceflight environment. Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation, abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been shown to weaken an astronaut’s immunity in as little as 10 to 15 days (Crucian et al., 2013), and these effects can persist up to 6 months post mission ISS (Crucian et al., 2015). This weakened immunity, combined with the prevalence of E. faecalis strains, or other potential pathogens including viruses (Rooney et al., 2019), could result in severe human health consequences on board the ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the introduction of a percutaneous catheter Mermel, 2012). With the detection of enterococci, we sought to determine the risk they posed to residents within the ISS – specifically, do they represent pathogenic lineages commonly associated with infections in hospitals, or do they represent commensals shed into the environment as a consequence of human habitation? In order to determine if the challenging environment of the air and surfaces of the ISS have selected for pathogenic strains of E. faecalis, we coupled previously employed genomic data analyses (Singh et al., 2018a) with phenotypic characterization of E. faecalis isolates recovered onboard the ISS. By assessing their antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity in the well-established C. elegans model (Garsin et al., 2001), we sought to test existing methods for identification of strains of E. faecalis with a high likelihood of causing in-flight infections.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Strains and Culture Conditions Bacterial isolates from the ISS (Figure 1 and Table 1) were initially recovered on tryptic soy agar, and preliminary identification was performed using a VITEK identification system (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, United States) as previously described (Castro et al., 2004). E. faecalis isolates OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the genome sequences of E. faecalis 5952 and JH-1 were made available from the Gilmore lab strain collection. All additional available whole genomes of E. faecalis (N = 44) were obtained from the  (). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Isolate recovery locations on the International Space Station.

(2007). NA: Not applicable. Except where described below, cultures of E. faecalis OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the ISS isolates (Table 1) were grown aerobically with shaking (250 RPM) at 37°C in brain heart infusion (BHI; DifcoTM, cat. no: 237500) broth. Growth kinetics for each isolate was assessed using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.), measuring optical density at 620 nm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for various antibiotics was evaluated in both Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or in BHI, as further detailed below. For the desiccation experiments, isolates were grown overnight in a chemically defined medium (CDM; Hussain et al., 1991) and plated onto M9 (DifcoTM, cat. no: 237500) agar plates amended with 1.0% glucose. To perform the C. elegans pathogenicity assays, cultures of Escherichia coli OP50 were prepared on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates as previously described (Powell and Ausubel, 2008). Genome Sequencing of ISS Strains For preparation of DNA, isolates were grown overnight in BHI broth. Cells were lysed using lysozyme (50 μg mL–1) and mutanolysin (2500 U mL–1), and the total DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen©, cat. no: 69504). Purified DNA was used for preparing libraries, which were then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq (250 nucleotide paired end reads) as previously described (Supplementary Table S1 in Lebreton et al., 2017). Additionally, a MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies©; ONT) library was prepared using the “one-pot” barcoding protocol, as developed by Josh Quick and the Loman Lab1. For each isolate, 24 μL of AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter® Life Sciences cat. no.: A63880) eluate was used as input for library preparation. This was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, 65°C for 5 min, then placed on ice for 30 s. Samples were barcoded using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT cat. no.: SQK-RBK001) and each was incubated at RT for 10 min, 70°C for 5 min, then placed on ice. The reaction product was then pooled with other samples (N = 4 total) in a clean 1.5 mL low-bind Eppendorf tube, before addition of 26.75 μl AMPure XP beads per sample. This was incubated at RT for 5 min, placed on the magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. The beads were washed with 200 μl 70% ethanol, incubated for 30 s, and the supernatant removed (2X) before spinning down and removal of the residual 70% ethanol. After air drying for 1 min, the beads were resuspended in 31 μl elution buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8), incubated off the magnet rack for 5 min, returned to the rack. DNA was quantified by fluorescence (ThermoFisher Scientific© Qubit 3.0 with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit; cat. no.: Q32854) and the sequencing adaptors were ligated (ONT cat. no.: SQK-LSK109) following the manufacturer’s protocols. This tube was incubated at RT for 10 min, 45.5 μl AMPure XP beads added, incubated for another 5 min, placed on magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. Next, 150 μl ABB was added and the beads resuspended by flicking, before placing the tube back on the magnet rack until clear. The supernatant was removed and the ABB wash repeated before spinning down the tube and removing the residual supernatant. Next, 12 ul EB was added and the bead resuspended by flicking before incubation at RT for 5 min. The tube was placed again on the magnet rack until clear, and the elution library was loaded on to an ONT MinION flow cell (R9.4.1) according to the manufacturer’s protocols and sequenced using MinKNOW (v1.11.5) with live basecalling (Supplementary Table S2). Output fastq files were concatenated and adaptors were removed and debarcoded with PoreChop (v0.2.32). Reads were quality filtered (≥ Q9) using NanoFilt (v2.2.0), and NanoPlot (v1.13.0) was then used to characterize sequencing datasets (De Coster et al., 2018). Genome Assembly Unicycler (v0.4.4) was used for long-read and hybrid assembly using default parameters, with the initial long-read assembly specified via the –existing_long_read_assembly flag for hybrid assembly (Wick et al., 2017). BWA (v0.7.17-r1188 with -x ont2d flag; docker container alexcoppe/bwa:latest) was used to map long reads onto the hybrid assembly to inspect assemblies and verify lack of evidence of mis-assemblies based on coverage. CheckM (v1.0.7) was used to evaluate completeness of final hybrid assemblies described in Table 1 (Parks et al., 2015). Pangenomic and Phylogenetic Analysis Genomes were annotated using Prokka (v.1.14.6; docker container quay.io/biocontainers/prokka:1.14.6–pl526_0 Seemann, 2014), and the pangenome analysis was performed using Roary (v3.12.0; docker container staphb/roary:3.12.0 Page et al., 2015). Genes that were present in a single isolate were defined as unique genes and, for strains utilized in this study, their identities were further examined by BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990) for comparison to the  non-redundant database. Based on DNA sequence comparison, an E. faecalis phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A) was constructed from the Roary-determined core gene alignment (1.69 Mb) using FastTree (docker container staphb/fasttree:2.1.11) using the General Time Invariant (GTR) model, and visualized using IcyTree (Vaughan, 2017). For a list of all genomes and gene presence/absence data see Supplementary Data File S1. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Whole genome analysis of Enterococcus faecalis. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of E. faecalis strains was determined based on FastTree generalized-time-reversible (GTR) analysis of SNPs present in the 1,844 core genes as determined by Roary (Page et al., 2015) and visualized with IcyTree (Vaughan, 2017). The alignment, when corrected for gaps and ambiguous bases, was 1.69 Mb. Branch support was 100% except as indicated. Isolates used in this study are indicated in bold. Asterisk (*) denotes an unfinished genome assembly (contigs). Clinical isolates that are phylogenetic neighbors of the ISS isolates are tagged with the biohazard symbol. (B) Genome size and gene count, the latter as estimated by Prokka (Seemann, 2014). (C) Gene presence/absence as estimated by Roary for the total of 9300 genes identified across the 51 genomes. A histogram of these data is provided as Supplementary Figure S1. Comparative Genomic Analysis Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed by evaluating seven E. faecalis genes (aroE, gdh, gki, gyd, pstS, xpt, and yqiL) and sequence types (STs) assigned based on the alleles present in each genome (Larsen et al., 2012). The potential presence of plasmids was assessed using PlasmidFinder (Carattoli et al., 2014). VirFinder was used to detect potential E. faecalis virulence factor genes (Joensen et al., 2014), and PathogenFinder provided a predictive score for each strain’s potential pathogenicity for humans (Cosentino et al., 2013). Additionally, the web server PHAge Search Tool – Enhanced Release (PHASTER) was used to detect the presence of phage sequences within bacterial genomic data (Arndt et al., 2016), and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) was used to identify genes potentially associated with antimicrobial resistance (Jia et al., 2016). The presence of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) arrays and Cas (CRISPR associated proteins) was detected using the online tool, CRISPRCasFinder (Couvin et al., 2018). Capsule type polymorphisms were determined as described by McBride et al. (2007). Briefly the presence, or absence, of genes in the locus (EF2485 to EF2495) were verified in the genomes of each isolate. CPS type 1 strains are defined as isolates with cpsA and B, and hcp1 (EF2484), while CPS type 2 strains consist of the full cps locus and hcp1 (EF2484 to EF2495). CPS type 5 strains are similar to the type 2 gene profile, but do not contain cpsF (EF0090). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Antibiotic MIC was determined by broth microdilution as described (CLSI, 2017). Briefly, overnight cultures of isolates were diluted and 104 cells in MH broth were inoculated into each well of 96 well plates containing serial 2-fold dilutions of antibiotics. Maximum concentration tested: penicillin (10 μg mL–1), amoxicillin (10 μg mL–1), ampicillin (10 μg mL–1), oxacillin (256 μg mL–1), erythromycin (50 μg mL–1), and tetracycline (64 μg mL–1). This procedure was repeated in BHI (McBride et al., 2007), and isolates were additionally evaluated for high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLGR) with: gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (each at a maximum concentration of 2 mg mL–1). Plates were incubated at 37°C and growth was monitored at 24 and 48 h. Wells containing the lowest antibiotic concentration lacking growth after 48 h were designated the MIC for the respective antibiotics. Desiccation Survival Survival to desiccation was assessed as previously described (Lebreton et al., 2017; Bryan et al., 2019) with the following modifications. E. faecalis isolates were harvested from stationary phase by centrifugation, and washed twice with sterile (autoclaved, 0.22 μm filtered) water (sH2O). Prior to desiccation, the concentrated cells were resuspended in CDM, and a 10 μL sample was track diluted (Jett et al., 1997) onto M9 medium (M9; Amresco®, cat. no.: J863-500G) amended with 0.1% glucose agar, and incubated at 37°C. After ∼24 h, the number of CFUs recovered from 10 μL track dilutions prepared according to Jett et al. (1997) were used to determine the original concentration of cells mL–1 (t = −1). Aliquots of cell suspensions (50 μL) were spotted onto autoclaved coverslips, and placed into the desiccation chamber containing Drierite® (≥ 98% CaSO4, W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Ltd., cat. no.: 778-18-9) until the liquid evaporated (t = 0, 24 h). The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. Three replicates were prepared for each isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet into 1 mL of sH2O. To ensure the samples were homogenously resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The cells were then serially diluted into sH2O and 10 μL track dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At the t = 0 time point, the number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated as the starting population size that survived the initial drying on the coverslip (N0). Subsequent samples were removed from the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined from the ratio of N/N0. Each time point was evaluated when N was ≥ 30 CFU. Pathogenicity of E. faecalis isolates in a C. elegans model Nematode killing assays were performed as previously described (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). Briefly, C. elegans fer-15;fem-1 (CF512) worms were grown on NGM inoculated with E. coli strain OP50 and incubated at 15°C until they reached the L4 stage. Approximately 30–40 of the L4 stage worms were then transferred to BHI agar plates (amended with kanamycin, 10 μg mL–1) inoculated with 100 μL aliquots of each log phase E. faecalis isolate. The plates were incubated at 25°C and worms were examined for viability. Worms that did not exhibit movement nor respond to physical touch were scored as dead and removed from the plate. Moving worms were scored as alive and also counted. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses for the desiccation experiments were performed using JMP® Pro v.14.3 (JMP®, 2019). Prior to evaluating the data for significant differences, the data were assessed for equal variances. Subsequent one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine the significant differences of desiccation survival at different timepoints and among individual isolates. Post hoc comparisons for time were performed using parametric comparisons with a control using Dunnett’s method (N = 18 for each isolate, with the exception of t = 12 d where N = 17). The mean N/N0 for each isolate at t = 21 d was evaluated using the non-parametric comparison with a control performed following the Steel method (N = 3 for each isolate). Individual comparisons for survival at two timepoints were performed using a homoscedastic Student’s t- test. The survival of C. elegans on each E. faecalis isolate was performed in triplicate. A Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis was performed to evaluate the survival curves using OASIS-2 (Han et al., 2016) as previously described Yuen (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). The data were determined to follow the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al., 2016), and pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data are reported as the average and the standard error (± SE) of the number of worms scored, and is reported in Table 2. TABLE 2.

    "results": "Results Isolates Recovered From the ISS The E. faecalis isolates recovered from air samples (ISS_1 and ISS_4) were both collected mid-module. ISS_1 was isolated from air samples collected in the United States Lab in 2009, and ISS_4 was recovered from the air in Node 3 in 2013 (Figure 1). ISS_2 and ISS_3, were two isolates recovered in 2011 from the same location, United States Lab handrail surfaces, approximately 14 feet apart. One was collected from the aft end of the module (at the interface with Node 1), and the other was recovered mid-module. The United States Lab was launched in 2001, and houses the various science payloads conducting research onboard the ISS (Singh et al., 2018b). Node 3, launched in 2010, and houses the air revitalization and water recovery systems, as well as amenities for crew hygiene, the restrooms, and exercise devices (Singh et al., 2018b). With preliminary identification based solely on the VITEK identification system, the first task for the isolate characterization was to create a fully sequenced genome for each isolate (Table 1). Pangenome Analysis With the complete genomes for each isolate assembled, several web-based tools were utilized for genomic characterization. First, seven gene loci were evaluated for their respective MLST using the web-based MLST server (Table 1; Larsen et al., 2012). ISS_1 was determined to be a single locus variant of sequence type (ST) 875, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 583 bases of pstS. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 were identified as ST30. ISS_4 was classified as ST40, a commonly recovered ST and a member of one of the largest clonal clusters, CC40 (McBride et al., 2007). A clonal cluster is defined as a ST consisting of three or more isolates (McBride et al., 2007). CC40 is comprised of ST40 and ST114, many of which were isolated from clinical sources (McBride et al., 2007). Based on the ST data described above, representative type strains were chosen for each as a comparator for each ISS ST (McBride et al., 2007), and a core genome of 1,844 genes shared by all 51 strains was defined (Page et al., 2015). An alignment of the core genome was then used to construct the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic proximity of the selected type strains to the ISS isolates validated the selection based on ST. Genome size and gene count (Figure 2B) show patterns of genomic expansion and loss within clades; for example, within the clade containing V583 a general pattern of larger genome size and higher gene count is evident, yet nearby ISS_1 has a more streamlined genome in comparison to its neighbors. Genes are classified into core, soft core, shell, and cloud on the basis of the number of isolates sharing each gene (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S1) and the Roary-estimated patterns of gene presence and absence highlight potential patterns of gene loss or gain (Supplementary Data File S1). Unique chromosomal genes, defined as those genes that were present in a single isolate, were non-uniformly distributed across each isolate genome (Supplementary Data File S1). ISS_1 (Accession no.: CP046113) contained the fewest number of unique genes (11 genes), 9 of which were designated hypothetical by Prokka (Seemann, 2014) yet had homology with other E. faecalis genomes on the basis of BLASTn searches. Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes with known annotations, mazG, which encodes a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase involved in survival under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTG-motif protein cell wall anchor domain protein. Neither ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.: CP046111) contained individually unique genes. Consistent with this finding, analysis of the core alignment revealed that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 differed by only 14 bases. However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were classified as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-110) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second (pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis (Supplementary Figure S2), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species, with all non-Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and, with lower identity and query coverage, Listeria (Supplementary Figure S3). Following the designations of McBride et al. (2007), the capsule type for each ISS strain was determined. All three known capsule type polymorphisms were detected from the ISS strains. ISS_1 contained the full cps locus (EF2485 to EF2495) and hcp1 (EF2484), and similar to MMH594 and V583, was designated CPS type 2. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the cps locus and hcp1, but lacked cpsF (EF0090). In agreement with previous analysis of two additional ST30 isolates (McBride et al., 2007), these strains were classified as CPS type 5. The strain ISS_4 contained only cpsA (EF0095), cpsB (EF0094), and hcp1, and like the other isolates of CC40 and OG1RF, was classified as CPS type 1 (McBride et al., 2007). Assessment of Mobile Elements and Defense Systems The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database identified the tetracycline resistance gene, tetW/N/W, in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, which was not present in OG1RF (Jia et al., 2016). The ISS tetW/N/W shared 69.3 (ISS_2 and ISS_3) and 69.1% (ISS_4) sequence homology with the reference sequence (Accession no.: ARO:3004442). The reference gene has been detected in 2.70% of the available E. faecalis isolates surveyed (Jia et al., 2016). A standard nucleotide BLAST search confirmed the tetW/N/W genes present in ISS_2 and ISS_3 shared 100% sequence identity to each other, and differed by three SNPs to the tetW/N/W gene present in ISS_4 (Altschul et al., 1990). PHASTER identified the presence of intact phage in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 (Supplementary Table S3; Arndt et al., 2016). ISS_2 and ISS_3 each contained three intact phage nucleotide sequences. The CC40 member ISS_4 contained a single intact phage region. No intact phage were detected in either ISS_1 or OG1RF. Thirty two (82%) of the 39 genes shared only by ISS_2 and ISS_3 were associated with intact or incomplete phage (Supplementary Data File S1). Plasmid-born genomic elements were only detected in ISS_4 using the tool PlasmidFinder (Table 1; Carattoli et al., 2014). Two plasmids were determined to share 96.7% sequence identity, and 99% coverage, to the V583 plasmid pTEF2 (accession number: AE016831; Paulsen et al., 2003), and 96.0% identity, with 100% coverage, to the pheromone responsive plasmid pAD1 (accession number: L01794; Ehrenfeld and Clewell, 1987). Notably, evidence for Lactobacillus prophage Lj928 was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and V583 (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, evidence for Enterococcus phage phiFL4A was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and MMH594 (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, mobile elements explained a majority (65%) of the unique genes identified in the ISS isolates. High confidence CRISPR-Cas systems were detected in isolates ISS_1, ISS_4, and OG1RF (Supplementary Table S4). CRISPR loci without the Cas genes were detected in the genomes of each of the ISS isolates and OG1RF (Supplementary Table S4). Genome-Based Assessment of the Potential for Pathogenicity The PathogenFinder server scored each of the ISS isolates and the reference strains as potential human pathogens (Table 1; Cosentino et al., 2013). The commensal strain OG1RF had the lowest pathogen score of 81.6%. With pathogen scores > 84%, all of the ISS strains had a higher assigned probability to be pathogenic than the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583 (each at 82.9%). By comparing the genomic content of the isolates to known E. faecalis genes associated with disease, a second predictor of pathogenicity could be compiled (Table 3; Joensen et al., 2014). The genomes of the clinical isolates contained the highest proportion of predicted virulence factors (18/20), while ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the least (13/20). ISS_1 and OG1RF both contained 15/20 virulence factors, and the genome ISS_4 was positive for 16/20. The clinical isolates and ISS_4 were the only strains to contain agg, encoding for the E. faecalis aggregation substance involved in biofilm formation, plasmid transfer, and increased virulence in endocarditis models (Bhatty et al., 2015).

Neither OG1RF nor the ISS isolates carried any of the genes in the cytolysin pathway reviewed by Coburn and Gilmore (2003). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Dilution concentration broth assays were used to determine the MIC for various antibiotics. Optical density measurements revealed there were no significant differences in the growth kinetics between the ISS isolates and the reference strains. Strains were first evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth for comparison to clinical laboratory standards for antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis ATCC® 29212 (CLSI, 2017), and in the commonly used growth media BHI to determine MICs relative to the commensal isolate OG1RF. In MH broth, all strains tested exceeded the resistance levels set forth by ≥ 2-fold for amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamycin, and kanamycin (CLSI, 2017). ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 were also categorized as resistant to tetracycline. When evaluated in BHI, all ISS strains exhibited MICs equivalent to OG1RF with the exceptions of oxacillin and tetracycline (Table 4). All ISS strains showed ≥ 4-fold more resistance to oxacillin. Isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, each carrying a tetW/N/W gene, displayed an MIC of 64 μg mL–1. These isolates were 4-fold more resistant to tetracycline than OG1RF (MIC of 16 μg mL–1), and displayed resistance levels equivalent to the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583. Unlike the clinical isolates, the ISS strains did not exhibit HLGR. TABLE 4. Minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics evaluated in BHI.

For the remainder of the experiment, the RH was maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. The concentration of cells surviving the drying process (N0) ranged from 1.2 (± 0.044) x 1010 to 5.5 (± 0.091) x 107 CFU for ISS-1 and OG1RF, respectively. The average number of survivors (N) after three weeks of desiccation ranged from 0.11 (± 0.024) to 8.5 (± 0.79) x 108 CFU for OG1RF and MMH594, respectively. OG1RF demonstrated the greatest loss in viability during dry down with a 2.1-log reduction, and ISS-2 was the only isolate that did not experience a significant loss in viability between t = 0 and t = 3 d (p = 0.11). There was no significant difference in N/N0 at any of the timepoints evaluated (p = 0.98; Figure 3). When the variances of N/N0 at t = 21 d for each isolate were determined to be significantly different from each other (F = 58, p < 0.001), a non-parametric comparison was performed with OG1RF chosen as the control using the Steel method. There was no significant difference in N/N0 at t = 21 d among the isolates tested when compared to OG1RF (Figure 3). FIGURE 3.

Pathogenicity of Isolates in a C. elegans Model The survival data (Figure 4) were determined to follow the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al., 2016). With the exception of ISS_1, all data are reported as the mean (± SE) of three replicates. For ISS_1, one sample became contaminated with fungus on day 9, and all subsequent data are reported as N = 2. C. elegans was least susceptible to strains ISS_2, ISS_3, and V583 with mean survival times of 13 (± 0.53), 13 (± 0.59), and 11 (± 0.91) days, respectively (Table 2). While the time for 50% of the worm population to die (LT50; Garsin et al., 2001) for these isolates ranged from 9 days (V583) to 14 (ISS_3), the total lifespan of worms challenged with these isolates were not significantly different from each other. For isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, all worms were deceased by day 18 and 17, respectively. While 90% of worms fed V583 were dead by day 18, some survivors persisted until day 24. Additionally, the lifespan of worms infected with ISS_3 was also statistically similar to those challenged with ISS_4. With a 31% decrease in the mean lifespan, worms infected with ISS_1 were significantly more susceptible than isolates fed ISS_2 or ISS_3 (p < 0.001). Based on the survival curves of worms fed ISS_1, ISS_4, OG1RF, MMH594, and V583 there were no significant differences in the pathogenicity profiles for these isolates (p > 0.05). FIGURE 4.

    "discussion": "Discussion While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019,Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019). Here, we expanded upon previous genomic analyses in an effort to provide a framework for the determination of the pathogenic potential of E. faecalis isolates. For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen because of their extensive genotypic (Shankar et al., 2002; Paulsen et al., 2003; McBride et al., 2007; Bourgogne et al., 2008) and phenotypic characterization, specifically in regards to C. elegans pathogenesis (Garsin et al., 2001; Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). In addition, the E. faecalis genomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively. While the amount of information that can be gleaned from a complete genome is large, the current methodologies (Singh et al., 2018a) are insufficient for the accurate assessment of pathogenicity for E. faecalis strains. The scores from the tool, PathogenFinder (Cosentino et al., 2013), predicted each of the ISS isolates as possessing > 84% probability of being pathogenic to humans, placing them above known clinical isolates MMH594 and V583 (Table 1). Another tool related to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identified twenty virulence factors among the ISS strains, but fifteen were present in the commensal isolate OG1RF as well (Table 3). We cautiously interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates, but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal strains of E. faecalis. Further validation for these predictive algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human health. Predictions from PathogenFinder or its equivalent can be expected to improve if additional training data at the genus or species level is incorporated. Because of the difficulty in interpreting potential pathogenicity of the ISS strains based on genome content alone, we tested them directly in the C. elegans infection model (Figure 4). Previous studies identified parallels in the pathogenicity profiles of various enterococcal lineages when tested in C. elegans (Garsin et al., 2001) and in mice (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In contrast to that report (Garsin et al., 2001), we did not detect significant difference in C. elegans survival when exposed to commensal OG1RF, or pathogenic V583 and the cytolytic strain MMH594. E. faecalis proliferate in the intestine of C. elegans (Garsin et al., 2001) ultimately occluding it (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). As a result, C. elegans infected with E. faecalis reach the LT50 33% faster than worms fed a normal diet of E. coli OP50 (Garsin et al., 2001). None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing (Figure 4). Closely related strains ISS_2 and 3, despite possessing a high computed pathogenicity score, were found to be least able to kill C. elegans (Figure 4). Additionally, there are currently no validated methods to predict phenotypic responses of enterococci to environmental stressors (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased cosmic radiation) based on their genomic content alone. Because each of the ISS isolates were recovered from air and surface samples, we examined them specifically for the ability to survive desiccation at RH relevant to the clinical environment (ASHRAE, 2013). In general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation tolerant than closely related microorganisms (Lebreton et al., 2017). Blaustein et al. (2019) demonstrated that the spaceflight environment onboard the ISS did not select for “extremo-tolerant” strains of B. cereus and S. aureus. Likewise, we found no significant differences in desiccation tolerance between the ISS E. faecalis isolates and their representative type strains (Figure 3). This indicates that their environmental survival in the ISS was attributable to the previously described intrinsically rugged nature of E. faecalis (Lebreton et al., 2017). Tirumalai et al. (2018) compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains, and also failed to find genomic signatures for their increased environmental resistances (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized stress response. In agreement with Blaustein et al. (2019) we conclude that the interior space environment (e.g., microgravity, increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species of bacteria, such as E. faecalis, but as of yet, there is no evidence suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence. In agreement with previous observations (Schiwon et al., 2013; Sobisch et al., 2019), the E. faecalis isolates examined here were resistant to multiple antibiotics. While the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria may sound alarming, much of that resistance is intrinsic to all enterococci, and other genetic signatures indicate that these are largely commensal strains (Table 3). However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of clinical isolates (Table 4). In addition to harboring genes that make combating infections difficult, E. faecalis strains possess the ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus (Sobisch et al., 2019). Although there have been no reports of VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication, it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43 (Singh et al., 2018b). During the same mission, E. faecalis was also ranked the second most abundant BSL-2 microorganism in the metagenomic analysis of the entire campaign (Singh et al., 2018b). In fact, Mora et al. (2019) determined Enterococcus to be one of the ten indicator genera that distinguished the ISS microbiome from the human and indoor samples of the Home Microbiome Project (Mora et al., 2019). There were several limitations to the data presented above. The desiccation survival experiments were terminated before any significant decrease in viability was observed. Extending the experiment until no surviving cells remained may have revealed a difference in the survival curves among the strains and provide insight to the length of time E. faecalis can remain viable. The lack of experimentally validated computational tools for E. faecalis led to conflicting results when comparing the genomes known clinical isolates to commensal strains. In addition, C. elegans serves as a rudimentary model system for human infection. However, the challenges presented here provide the foundation for future investigations of E. faecalis, on Earth or in space. As members of the core gut microbiome, E. faecalis will continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to detect pathogenic strains will be beneficial for crew health. Unlike most environmental bacteria (Staley and Konopka, 1985), E. faecalis strains are routinely recovered on culture media. Based on the antibiotic resistance profiles presented here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the first step toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis. Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability of E. faecalis to readily acquire and spread mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring and pathogen identification will be important. Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling occurs once a month for the first 90 days of a mission, and decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter (ISS-MORD, 2013). Because these microbial monitoring procedures are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate (Staley and Konopka, 1985). Assessing the total microbial burden, and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS microbiome (Be et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019). However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms are relevant to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019). The need for expedient identification of pathogenic microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles is not a challenge unique to the spaceflight environment. Recent advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents, yet these resources are not always widely available (Maurer et al., 2017). Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the crew have access to Wetlab-2 Cepheid© SmartCycyler that can be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples3. Although it is currently configured to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the RAZORTM EX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.) is currently being developed for in-flight microbial monitoring and could be modified for a wider range of microbial targets. Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the ONT MinION sequencing device employed above. Castro-Wallace et al. (2017) have previously validated its efficacy in the spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data (Sanderson et al., 2018) or isolated samples (Gargis et al., 2019) and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight (Burton et al., 2020). Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis, we make the following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR. Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule (McBride et al., 2007), the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 (Paulsen et al., 2003), components of the pathogenicity island (e.g., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays (Van Tyne et al., 2019). This information would then provide near real-time information for the crew regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures. These advancements would not be limited to E. faecalis isolates, however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen detection will need to be experimentally validated (Chiu and Miller, 2019). With the development of such targets, multiple pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be identified within a single sample (Miller et al., 2019).",

Copyright notice ID: 7829349 PMID: 33505359 Abstract Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms. Keywords: International Space Station (ISS), Enterococcus faecalis, pangenome, antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, pathogenicityIntroduction Enterococcus faecalis represent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment. Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (∼425 million years ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus (Lebreton et al., 2017). Supporting that proposition, enterococci display significantly higher levels of resistance to a variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and starvation than ancestral outgroups (Lebreton et al., 2017). Because traits contributing to environmental persistence also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment, enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated infections (Weiner et al., 2016). While certain strains of E. faecalis are pathogenic for hospitalized patients, e.g., MMH594 (Huycke et al., 1991) and V583 (Sahm et al., 1989), and possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates are 25% smaller, as typified by the strain OG1RF (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci (Fiore et al., 2019). Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors (Shankar et al., 2002), however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined. The ISS provides a unique opportunity to study the establishment of a microbiome in what originated as a clean, hermetically sealed built environment, where the influx of new microorganisms only occurs periodically with the arrival of new crew and supplies. The microbiome of the ISS has been extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic (Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018b; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Blaustein et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019) and culture-based investigations (Schiwon et al., 2013; Venkateswaran, 2017; Singh et al., 2018a; Blaustein et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019), yet only recently have these effort been combined (Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019). The results are divided among those that report similarities to Earth built environments (Schiwon et al., 2013; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019) including United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (Be et al., 2017), and those that detected significant differences from terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project (Lang et al., 2017), the Japan-based ISS analog module (Ichijo et al., 2016), and a French Guiana-based cleanroom (Mora et al., 2019). Despite the differences in methodologies and results, the detection of opportunistic human pathogens (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Sielaff et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019) including E. faecalis, is a common phenomenon. With the exception of Be et al. (2017), the previous metagenomic efforts were limited to characterizing diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution to confidently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed for Staphylococcus aureus (Blaustein et al., 2019) and Enterobacter bugandensis (Singh et al., 2018a), only a single culture-based report has quantified pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporum isolates from the ISS Urbaniak et al., 2019) in a host model. As a result, the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact crew health remains unclear. In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS, understanding the effects of spaceflight on bacterial physiology will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was exposed to spaceflight, there was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass, biofilm thickness, and the cells produced a unique biofilm architecture not seen in ground controls of the species (Mclean et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2013). Su et al. (2014) documented growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and conversion) in Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens during spaceflight (Wang et al., 2014). Carbon utilization profiles were altered among S. marcescens clones after flight, and transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed significant changes in metabolic functions (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally, Wilson et al. (2007) utilized proteomic analysis and expression profiles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation of Salmonella typhymurium were widely distributed, and virulence was increased in response to spaceflight. Although Hammond et al. (2013) report a significant decrease in E. faecalis OG1RF virulence when grown under spaceflight conditions, this was inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures grown in the presence of adult Caenorhabditis elegans rather than worm viability. In addition to altered microbial physiological responses, astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceflight environment. Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation, abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been shown to weaken an astronaut’s immunity in as little as 10 to 15 days (Crucian et al., 2013), and these effects can persist up to 6 months post mission ISS (Crucian et al., 2015). This weakened immunity, combined with the prevalence of E. faecalis strains, or other potential pathogens including viruses (Rooney et al., 2019), could result in severe human health consequences on board the ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the introduction of a percutaneous catheter Mermel, 2012). With the detection of enterococci, we sought to determine the risk they posed to residents within the ISS – specifically, do they represent pathogenic lineages commonly associated with infections in hospitals, or do they represent commensals shed into the environment as a consequence of human habitation? In order to determine if the challenging environment of the air and surfaces of the ISS have selected for pathogenic strains of E. faecalis, we coupled previously employed genomic data analyses (Singh et al., 2018a) with phenotypic characterization of E. faecalis isolates recovered onboard the ISS. By assessing their antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity in the well-established C. elegans model (Garsin et al., 2001), we sought to test existing methods for identification of strains of E. faecalis with a high likelihood of causing in-flight infections.Materials and Methods Strains and Culture Conditions Bacterial isolates from the ISS (Figure 1 and Table 1) were initially recovered on tryptic soy agar, and preliminary identification was performed using a VITEK identification system (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, United States) as previously described (Castro et al., 2004). E. faecalis isolates OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the genome sequences of E. faecalis 5952 and JH-1 were made available from the Gilmore lab strain collection. All additional available whole genomes of E. faecalis (N = 44) were obtained from the  (). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Isolate recovery locations on the International Space Station.

(2007). NA: Not applicable. Except where described below, cultures of E. faecalis OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the ISS isolates (Table 1) were grown aerobically with shaking (250 RPM) at 37°C in brain heart infusion (BHI; DifcoTM, cat. no: 237500) broth. Growth kinetics for each isolate was assessed using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.), measuring optical density at 620 nm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for various antibiotics was evaluated in both Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or in BHI, as further detailed below. For the desiccation experiments, isolates were grown overnight in a chemically defined medium (CDM; Hussain et al., 1991) and plated onto M9 (DifcoTM, cat. no: 237500) agar plates amended with 1.0% glucose. To perform the C. elegans pathogenicity assays, cultures of Escherichia coli OP50 were prepared on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates as previously described (Powell and Ausubel, 2008).Genome Sequencing of ISS Strains For preparation of DNA, isolates were grown overnight in BHI broth. Cells were lysed using lysozyme (50 μg mL–1) and mutanolysin (2500 U mL–1), and the total DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen©, cat. no: 69504). Purified DNA was used for preparing libraries, which were then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq (250 nucleotide paired end reads) as previously described (Supplementary Table S1 in Lebreton et al., 2017). Additionally, a MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies©; ONT) library was prepared using the “one-pot” barcoding protocol, as developed by Josh Quick and the Loman Lab1. For each isolate, 24 μL of AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter® Life Sciences cat. no.: A63880) eluate was used as input for library preparation. This was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, 65°C for 5 min, then placed on ice for 30 s. Samples were barcoded using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT cat. no.: SQK-RBK001) and each was incubated at RT for 10 min, 70°C for 5 min, then placed on ice. The reaction product was then pooled with other samples (N = 4 total) in a clean 1.5 mL low-bind Eppendorf tube, before addition of 26.75 μl AMPure XP beads per sample. This was incubated at RT for 5 min, placed on the magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. The beads were washed with 200 μl 70% ethanol, incubated for 30 s, and the supernatant removed (2X) before spinning down and removal of the residual 70% ethanol. After air drying for 1 min, the beads were resuspended in 31 μl elution buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8), incubated off the magnet rack for 5 min, returned to the rack. DNA was quantified by fluorescence (ThermoFisher Scientific© Qubit 3.0 with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit; cat. no.: Q32854) and the sequencing adaptors were ligated (ONT cat. no.: SQK-LSK109) following the manufacturer’s protocols. This tube was incubated at RT for 10 min, 45.5 μl AMPure XP beads added, incubated for another 5 min, placed on magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. Next, 150 μl ABB was added and the beads resuspended by flicking, before placing the tube back on the magnet rack until clear. The supernatant was removed and the ABB wash repeated before spinning down the tube and removing the residual supernatant. Next, 12 ul EB was added and the bead resuspended by flicking before incubation at RT for 5 min. The tube was placed again on the magnet rack until clear, and the elution library was loaded on to an ONT MinION flow cell (R9.4.1) according to the manufacturer’s protocols and sequenced using MinKNOW (v1.11.5) with live basecalling (Supplementary Table S2). Output fastq files were concatenated and adaptors were removed and debarcoded with PoreChop (v0.2.32). Reads were quality filtered (≥ Q9) using NanoFilt (v2.2.0), and NanoPlot (v1.13.0) was then used to characterize sequencing datasets (De Coster et al., 2018).Genome Assembly Unicycler (v0.4.4) was used for long-read and hybrid assembly using default parameters, with the initial long-read assembly specified via the –existing_long_read_assembly flag for hybrid assembly (Wick et al., 2017). BWA (v0.7.17-r1188 with -x ont2d flag; docker container alexcoppe/bwa:latest) was used to map long reads onto the hybrid assembly to inspect assemblies and verify lack of evidence of mis-assemblies based on coverage. CheckM (v1.0.7) was used to evaluate completeness of final hybrid assemblies described in Table 1 (Parks et al., 2015).Pangenomic and Phylogenetic Analysis Genomes were annotated using Prokka (v.1.14.6; docker container quay.io/biocontainers/prokka:1.14.6–pl526_0 Seemann, 2014), and the pangenome analysis was performed using Roary (v3.12.0; docker container staphb/roary:3.12.0 Page et al., 2015). Genes that were present in a single isolate were defined as unique genes and, for strains utilized in this study, their identities were further examined by BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990) for comparison to the  non-redundant database. Based on DNA sequence comparison, an E. faecalis phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A) was constructed from the Roary-determined core gene alignment (1.69 Mb) using FastTree (docker container staphb/fasttree:2.1.11) using the General Time Invariant (GTR) model, and visualized using IcyTree (Vaughan, 2017). For a list of all genomes and gene presence/absence data see Supplementary Data File S1. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Whole genome analysis of Enterococcus faecalis. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of E. faecalis strains was determined based on FastTree generalized-time-reversible (GTR) analysis of SNPs present in the 1,844 core genes as determined by Roary (Page et al., 2015) and visualized with IcyTree (Vaughan, 2017). The alignment, when corrected for gaps and ambiguous bases, was 1.69 Mb. Branch support was 100% except as indicated. Isolates used in this study are indicated in bold. Asterisk (*) denotes an unfinished genome assembly (contigs). Clinical isolates that are phylogenetic neighbors of the ISS isolates are tagged with the biohazard symbol. (B) Genome size and gene count, the latter as estimated by Prokka (Seemann, 2014). (C) Gene presence/absence as estimated by Roary for the total of 9300 genes identified across the 51 genomes. A histogram of these data is provided as Supplementary Figure S1.Comparative Genomic Analysis Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed by evaluating seven E. faecalis genes (aroE, gdh, gki, gyd, pstS, xpt, and yqiL) and sequence types (STs) assigned based on the alleles present in each genome (Larsen et al., 2012). The potential presence of plasmids was assessed using PlasmidFinder (Carattoli et al., 2014). VirFinder was used to detect potential E. faecalis virulence factor genes (Joensen et al., 2014), and PathogenFinder provided a predictive score for each strain’s potential pathogenicity for humans (Cosentino et al., 2013). Additionally, the web server PHAge Search Tool – Enhanced Release (PHASTER) was used to detect the presence of phage sequences within bacterial genomic data (Arndt et al., 2016), and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) was used to identify genes potentially associated with antimicrobial resistance (Jia et al., 2016). The presence of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) arrays and Cas (CRISPR associated proteins) was detected using the online tool, CRISPRCasFinder (Couvin et al., 2018). Capsule type polymorphisms were determined as described by McBride et al. (2007). Briefly the presence, or absence, of genes in the locus (EF2485 to EF2495) were verified in the genomes of each isolate. CPS type 1 strains are defined as isolates with cpsA and B, and hcp1 (EF2484), while CPS type 2 strains consist of the full cps locus and hcp1 (EF2484 to EF2495). CPS type 5 strains are similar to the type 2 gene profile, but do not contain cpsF (EF0090).Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Antibiotic MIC was determined by broth microdilution as described (CLSI, 2017). Briefly, overnight cultures of isolates were diluted and 104 cells in MH broth were inoculated into each well of 96 well plates containing serial 2-fold dilutions of antibiotics. Maximum concentration tested: penicillin (10 μg mL–1), amoxicillin (10 μg mL–1), ampicillin (10 μg mL–1), oxacillin (256 μg mL–1), erythromycin (50 μg mL–1), and tetracycline (64 μg mL–1). This procedure was repeated in BHI (McBride et al., 2007), and isolates were additionally evaluated for high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLGR) with: gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (each at a maximum concentration of 2 mg mL–1). Plates were incubated at 37°C and growth was monitored at 24 and 48 h. Wells containing the lowest antibiotic concentration lacking growth after 48 h were designated the MIC for the respective antibiotics.Desiccation Survival Survival to desiccation was assessed as previously described (Lebreton et al., 2017; Bryan et al., 2019) with the following modifications. E. faecalis isolates were harvested from stationary phase by centrifugation, and washed twice with sterile (autoclaved, 0.22 μm filtered) water (sH2O). Prior to desiccation, the concentrated cells were resuspended in CDM, and a 10 μL sample was track diluted (Jett et al., 1997) onto M9 medium (M9; Amresco®, cat. no.: J863-500G) amended with 0.1% glucose agar, and incubated at 37°C. After ∼24 h, the number of CFUs recovered from 10 μL track dilutions prepared according to Jett et al. (1997) were used to determine the original concentration of cells mL–1 (t = −1). Aliquots of cell suspensions (50 μL) were spotted onto autoclaved coverslips, and placed into the desiccation chamber containing Drierite® (≥ 98% CaSO4, W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Ltd., cat. no.: 778-18-9) until the liquid evaporated (t = 0, 24 h). The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. Three replicates were prepared for each isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet into 1 mL of sH2O. To ensure the samples were homogenously resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The cells were then serially diluted into sH2O and 10 μL track dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At the t = 0 time point, the number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated as the starting population size that survived the initial drying on the coverslip (N0). Subsequent samples were removed from the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined from the ratio of N/N0. Each time point was evaluated when N was ≥ 30 CFU.Pathogenicity of E. faecalis isolates in a C. elegans model Nematode killing assays were performed as previously described (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). Briefly, C. elegans fer-15;fem-1 (CF512) worms were grown on NGM inoculated with E. coli strain OP50 and incubated at 15°C until they reached the L4 stage. Approximately 30–40 of the L4 stage worms were then transferred to BHI agar plates (amended with kanamycin, 10 μg mL–1) inoculated with 100 μL aliquots of each log phase E. faecalis isolate. The plates were incubated at 25°C and worms were examined for viability. Worms that did not exhibit movement nor respond to physical touch were scored as dead and removed from the plate. Moving worms were scored as alive and also counted.Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses for the desiccation experiments were performed using JMP® Pro v.14.3 (JMP®, 2019). Prior to evaluating the data for significant differences, the data were assessed for equal variances. Subsequent one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine the significant differences of desiccation survival at different timepoints and among individual isolates. Post hoc comparisons for time were performed using parametric comparisons with a control using Dunnett’s method (N = 18 for each isolate, with the exception of t = 12 d where N = 17). The mean N/N0 for each isolate at t = 21 d was evaluated using the non-parametric comparison with a control performed following the Steel method (N = 3 for each isolate). Individual comparisons for survival at two timepoints were performed using a homoscedastic Student’s t- test. The survival of C. elegans on each E. faecalis isolate was performed in triplicate. A Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis was performed to evaluate the survival curves using OASIS-2 (Han et al., 2016) as previously described Yuen (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). The data were determined to follow the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al., 2016), and pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni-corrected p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data are reported as the average and the standard error (± SE) of the number of worms scored, and is reported in Table 2. TABLE 2.

Those that were not significantly different from each other are indicated with a capital letter, with A being the least pathogenic (p > 0.05).Results Isolates Recovered From the ISS The E. faecalis isolates recovered from air samples (ISS_1 and ISS_4) were both collected mid-module. ISS_1 was isolated from air samples collected in the United States Lab in 2009, and ISS_4 was recovered from the air in Node 3 in 2013 (Figure 1). ISS_2 and ISS_3, were two isolates recovered in 2011 from the same location, United States Lab handrail surfaces, approximately 14 feet apart. One was collected from the aft end of the module (at the interface with Node 1), and the other was recovered mid-module. The United States Lab was launched in 2001, and houses the various science payloads conducting research onboard the ISS (Singh et al., 2018b). Node 3, launched in 2010, and houses the air revitalization and water recovery systems, as well as amenities for crew hygiene, the restrooms, and exercise devices (Singh et al., 2018b). With preliminary identification based solely on the VITEK identification system, the first task for the isolate characterization was to create a fully sequenced genome for each isolate (Table 1).Pangenome Analysis With the complete genomes for each isolate assembled, several web-based tools were utilized for genomic characterization. First, seven gene loci were evaluated for their respective MLST using the web-based MLST server (Table 1; Larsen et al., 2012). ISS_1 was determined to be a single locus variant of sequence type (ST) 875, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 583 bases of pstS. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 were identified as ST30. ISS_4 was classified as ST40, a commonly recovered ST and a member of one of the largest clonal clusters, CC40 (McBride et al., 2007). A clonal cluster is defined as a ST consisting of three or more isolates (McBride et al., 2007). CC40 is comprised of ST40 and ST114, many of which were isolated from clinical sources (McBride et al., 2007). Based on the ST data described above, representative type strains were chosen for each as a comparator for each ISS ST (McBride et al., 2007), and a core genome of 1,844 genes shared by all 51 strains was defined (Page et al., 2015). An alignment of the core genome was then used to construct the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic proximity of the selected type strains to the ISS isolates validated the selection based on ST. Genome size and gene count (Figure 2B) show patterns of genomic expansion and loss within clades; for example, within the clade containing V583 a general pattern of larger genome size and higher gene count is evident, yet nearby ISS_1 has a more streamlined genome in comparison to its neighbors. Genes are classified into core, soft core, shell, and cloud on the basis of the number of isolates sharing each gene (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S1) and the Roary-estimated patterns of gene presence and absence highlight potential patterns of gene loss or gain (Supplementary Data File S1). Unique chromosomal genes, defined as those genes that were present in a single isolate, were non-uniformly distributed across each isolate genome (Supplementary Data File S1). ISS_1 (Accession no.: CP046113) contained the fewest number of unique genes (11 genes), 9 of which were designated hypothetical by Prokka (Seemann, 2014) yet had homology with other E. faecalis genomes on the basis of BLASTn searches. Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes with known annotations, mazG, which encodes a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase involved in survival under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTG-motif protein cell wall anchor domain protein. Neither ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.: CP046111) contained individually unique genes. Consistent with this finding, analysis of the core alignment revealed that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 differed by only 14 bases. However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were classified as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-110) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second (pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis (Supplementary Figure S2), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species, with all non-Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and, with lower identity and query coverage, Listeria (Supplementary Figure S3). Following the designations of McBride et al. (2007), the capsule type for each ISS strain was determined. All three known capsule type polymorphisms were detected from the ISS strains. ISS_1 contained the full cps locus (EF2485 to EF2495) and hcp1 (EF2484), and similar to MMH594 and V583, was designated CPS type 2. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the cps locus and hcp1, but lacked cpsF (EF0090). In agreement with previous analysis of two additional ST30 isolates (McBride et al., 2007), these strains were classified as CPS type 5. The strain ISS_4 contained only cpsA (EF0095), cpsB (EF0094), and hcp1, and like the other isolates of CC40 and OG1RF, was classified as CPS type 1 (McBride et al., 2007).Assessment of Mobile Elements and Defense Systems The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database identified the tetracycline resistance gene, tetW/N/W, in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, which was not present in OG1RF (Jia et al., 2016). The ISS tetW/N/W shared 69.3 (ISS_2 and ISS_3) and 69.1% (ISS_4) sequence homology with the reference sequence (Accession no.: ARO:3004442). The reference gene has been detected in 2.70% of the available E. faecalis isolates surveyed (Jia et al., 2016). A standard nucleotide BLAST search confirmed the tetW/N/W genes present in ISS_2 and ISS_3 shared 100% sequence identity to each other, and differed by three SNPs to the tetW/N/W gene present in ISS_4 (Altschul et al., 1990). PHASTER identified the presence of intact phage in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 (Supplementary Table S3; Arndt et al., 2016). ISS_2 and ISS_3 each contained three intact phage nucleotide sequences. The CC40 member ISS_4 contained a single intact phage region. No intact phage were detected in either ISS_1 or OG1RF. Thirty two (82%) of the 39 genes shared only by ISS_2 and ISS_3 were associated with intact or incomplete phage (Supplementary Data File S1). Plasmid-born genomic elements were only detected in ISS_4 using the tool PlasmidFinder (Table 1; Carattoli et al., 2014). Two plasmids were determined to share 96.7% sequence identity, and 99% coverage, to the V583 plasmid pTEF2 (accession number: AE016831; Paulsen et al., 2003), and 96.0% identity, with 100% coverage, to the pheromone responsive plasmid pAD1 (accession number: L01794; Ehrenfeld and Clewell, 1987). Notably, evidence for Lactobacillus prophage Lj928 was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and V583 (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, evidence for Enterococcus phage phiFL4A was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and MMH594 (Supplementary Table S3). Overall, mobile elements explained a majority (65%) of the unique genes identified in the ISS isolates. High confidence CRISPR-Cas systems were detected in isolates ISS_1, ISS_4, and OG1RF (Supplementary Table S4). CRISPR loci without the Cas genes were detected in the genomes of each of the ISS isolates and OG1RF (Supplementary Table S4).Genome-Based Assessment of the Potential for Pathogenicity The PathogenFinder server scored each of the ISS isolates and the reference strains as potential human pathogens (Table 1; Cosentino et al., 2013). The commensal strain OG1RF had the lowest pathogen score of 81.6%. With pathogen scores > 84%, all of the ISS strains had a higher assigned probability to be pathogenic than the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583 (each at 82.9%). By comparing the genomic content of the isolates to known E. faecalis genes associated with disease, a second predictor of pathogenicity could be compiled (Table 3; Joensen et al., 2014). The genomes of the clinical isolates contained the highest proportion of predicted virulence factors (18/20), while ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the least (13/20). ISS_1 and OG1RF both contained 15/20 virulence factors, and the genome ISS_4 was positive for 16/20. The clinical isolates and ISS_4 were the only strains to contain agg, encoding for the E. faecalis aggregation substance involved in biofilm formation, plasmid transfer, and increased virulence in endocarditis models (Bhatty et al., 2015).

Neither OG1RF nor the ISS isolates carried any of the genes in the cytolysin pathway reviewed by Coburn and Gilmore (2003).Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Dilution concentration broth assays were used to determine the MIC for various antibiotics. Optical density measurements revealed there were no significant differences in the growth kinetics between the ISS isolates and the reference strains. Strains were first evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth for comparison to clinical laboratory standards for antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis ATCC® 29212 (CLSI, 2017), and in the commonly used growth media BHI to determine MICs relative to the commensal isolate OG1RF. In MH broth, all strains tested exceeded the resistance levels set forth by ≥ 2-fold for amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamycin, and kanamycin (CLSI, 2017). ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 were also categorized as resistant to tetracycline. When evaluated in BHI, all ISS strains exhibited MICs equivalent to OG1RF with the exceptions of oxacillin and tetracycline (Table 4). All ISS strains showed ≥ 4-fold more resistance to oxacillin. Isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, each carrying a tetW/N/W gene, displayed an MIC of 64 μg mL–1. These isolates were 4-fold more resistant to tetracycline than OG1RF (MIC of 16 μg mL–1), and displayed resistance levels equivalent to the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583. Unlike the clinical isolates, the ISS strains did not exhibit HLGR. TABLE 4. Minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics evaluated in BHI.

For the remainder of the experiment, the RH was maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. The concentration of cells surviving the drying process (N0) ranged from 1.2 (± 0.044) x 1010 to 5.5 (± 0.091) x 107 CFU for ISS-1 and OG1RF, respectively. The average number of survivors (N) after three weeks of desiccation ranged from 0.11 (± 0.024) to 8.5 (± 0.79) x 108 CFU for OG1RF and MMH594, respectively. OG1RF demonstrated the greatest loss in viability during dry down with a 2.1-log reduction, and ISS-2 was the only isolate that did not experience a significant loss in viability between t = 0 and t = 3 d (p = 0.11). There was no significant difference in N/N0 at any of the timepoints evaluated (p = 0.98; Figure 3). When the variances of N/N0 at t = 21 d for each isolate were determined to be significantly different from each other (F = 58, p < 0.001), a non-parametric comparison was performed with OG1RF chosen as the control using the Steel method. There was no significant difference in N/N0 at t = 21 d among the isolates tested when compared to OG1RF (Figure 3). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Desiccation survival of Enterococcus faecalis strains from the ISS and the control strains, OG1RF and MMH594. The data are presented as the average (± SD) of triplicate measurements. Some error bars have been obscured by the data points.Pathogenicity of Isolates in a C. elegans Model The survival data (Figure 4) were determined to follow the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Han et al., 2016). With the exception of ISS_1, all data are reported as the mean (± SE) of three replicates. For ISS_1, one sample became contaminated with fungus on day 9, and all subsequent data are reported as N = 2. C. elegans was least susceptible to strains ISS_2, ISS_3, and V583 with mean survival times of 13 (± 0.53), 13 (± 0.59), and 11 (± 0.91) days, respectively (Table 2). While the time for 50% of the worm population to die (LT50; Garsin et al., 2001) for these isolates ranged from 9 days (V583) to 14 (ISS_3), the total lifespan of worms challenged with these isolates were not significantly different from each other. For isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, all worms were deceased by day 18 and 17, respectively. While 90% of worms fed V583 were dead by day 18, some survivors persisted until day 24. Additionally, the lifespan of worms infected with ISS_3 was also statistically similar to those challenged with ISS_4. With a 31% decrease in the mean lifespan, worms infected with ISS_1 were significantly more susceptible than isolates fed ISS_2 or ISS_3 (p < 0.001). Based on the survival curves of worms fed ISS_1, ISS_4, OG1RF, MMH594, and V583 there were no significant differences in the pathogenicity profiles for these isolates (p > 0.05). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab The average survival of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to ISS and control strains of Enterococcus faecalis.Discussion While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019,Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019). Here, we expanded upon previous genomic analyses in an effort to provide a framework for the determination of the pathogenic potential of E. faecalis isolates. For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen because of their extensive genotypic (Shankar et al., 2002; Paulsen et al., 2003; McBride et al., 2007; Bourgogne et al., 2008) and phenotypic characterization, specifically in regards to C. elegans pathogenesis (Garsin et al., 2001; Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). In addition, the E. faecalis genomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively. While the amount of information that can be gleaned from a complete genome is large, the current methodologies (Singh et al., 2018a) are insufficient for the accurate assessment of pathogenicity for E. faecalis strains. The scores from the tool, PathogenFinder (Cosentino et al., 2013), predicted each of the ISS isolates as possessing > 84% probability of being pathogenic to humans, placing them above known clinical isolates MMH594 and V583 (Table 1). Another tool related to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identified twenty virulence factors among the ISS strains, but fifteen were present in the commensal isolate OG1RF as well (Table 3). We cautiously interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates, but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal strains of E. faecalis. Further validation for these predictive algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human health. Predictions from PathogenFinder or its equivalent can be expected to improve if additional training data at the genus or species level is incorporated. Because of the difficulty in interpreting potential pathogenicity of the ISS strains based on genome content alone, we tested them directly in the C. elegans infection model (Figure 4). Previous studies identified parallels in the pathogenicity profiles of various enterococcal lineages when tested in C. elegans (Garsin et al., 2001) and in mice (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In contrast to that report (Garsin et al., 2001), we did not detect significant difference in C. elegans survival when exposed to commensal OG1RF, or pathogenic V583 and the cytolytic strain MMH594. E. faecalis proliferate in the intestine of C. elegans (Garsin et al., 2001) ultimately occluding it (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). As a result, C. elegans infected with E. faecalis reach the LT50 33% faster than worms fed a normal diet of E. coli OP50 (Garsin et al., 2001). None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing (Figure 4). Closely related strains ISS_2 and 3, despite possessing a high computed pathogenicity score, were found to be least able to kill C. elegans (Figure 4). Additionally, there are currently no validated methods to predict phenotypic responses of enterococci to environmental stressors (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased cosmic radiation) based on their genomic content alone. Because each of the ISS isolates were recovered from air and surface samples, we examined them specifically for the ability to survive desiccation at RH relevant to the clinical environment (ASHRAE, 2013). In general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation tolerant than closely related microorganisms (Lebreton et al., 2017). Blaustein et al. (2019) demonstrated that the spaceflight environment onboard the ISS did not select for “extremo-tolerant” strains of B. cereus and S. aureus. Likewise, we found no significant differences in desiccation tolerance between the ISS E. faecalis isolates and their representative type strains (Figure 3). This indicates that their environmental survival in the ISS was attributable to the previously described intrinsically rugged nature of E. faecalis (Lebreton et al., 2017). Tirumalai et al. (2018) compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains, and also failed to find genomic signatures for their increased environmental resistances (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized stress response. In agreement with Blaustein et al. (2019) we conclude that the interior space environment (e.g., microgravity, increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species of bacteria, such as E. faecalis, but as of yet, there is no evidence suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence. In agreement with previous observations (Schiwon et al., 2013; Sobisch et al., 2019), the E. faecalis isolates examined here were resistant to multiple antibiotics. While the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria may sound alarming, much of that resistance is intrinsic to all enterococci, and other genetic signatures indicate that these are largely commensal strains (Table 3). However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of clinical isolates (Table 4). In addition to harboring genes that make combating infections difficult, E. faecalis strains possess the ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus (Sobisch et al., 2019). Although there have been no reports of VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication, it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43 (Singh et al., 2018b). During the same mission, E. faecalis was also ranked the second most abundant BSL-2 microorganism in the metagenomic analysis of the entire campaign (Singh et al., 2018b). In fact, Mora et al. (2019) determined Enterococcus to be one of the ten indicator genera that distinguished the ISS microbiome from the human and indoor samples of the Home Microbiome Project (Mora et al., 2019). There were several limitations to the data presented above. The desiccation survival experiments were terminated before any significant decrease in viability was observed. Extending the experiment until no surviving cells remained may have revealed a difference in the survival curves among the strains and provide insight to the length of time E. faecalis can remain viable. The lack of experimentally validated computational tools for E. faecalis led to conflicting results when comparing the genomes known clinical isolates to commensal strains. In addition, C. elegans serves as a rudimentary model system for human infection. However, the challenges presented here provide the foundation for future investigations of E. faecalis, on Earth or in space. As members of the core gut microbiome, E. faecalis will continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to detect pathogenic strains will be beneficial for crew health. Unlike most environmental bacteria (Staley and Konopka, 1985), E. faecalis strains are routinely recovered on culture media. Based on the antibiotic resistance profiles presented here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the first step toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis. Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability of E. faecalis to readily acquire and spread mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring and pathogen identification will be important. Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling occurs once a month for the first 90 days of a mission, and decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter (ISS-MORD, 2013). Because these microbial monitoring procedures are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate (Staley and Konopka, 1985). Assessing the total microbial burden, and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS microbiome (Be et al., 2017; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019). However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms are relevant to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013; Be et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018a,b; Mora et al., 2019; Sielaff et al., 2019; Sobisch et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2019). The need for expedient identification of pathogenic microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles is not a challenge unique to the spaceflight environment. Recent advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents, yet these resources are not always widely available (Maurer et al., 2017). Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the crew have access to Wetlab-2 Cepheid© SmartCycyler that can be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples3. Although it is currently configured to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the RAZORTM EX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.) is currently being developed for in-flight microbial monitoring and could be modified for a wider range of microbial targets. Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the ONT MinION sequencing device employed above. Castro-Wallace et al. (2017) have previously validated its efficacy in the spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data (Sanderson et al., 2018) or isolated samples (Gargis et al., 2019) and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight (Burton et al., 2020). Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis, we make the following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR. Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule (McBride et al., 2007), the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 (Paulsen et al., 2003), components of the pathogenicity island (e.g., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays (Van Tyne et al., 2019). This information would then provide near real-time information for the crew regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures. These advancements would not be limited to E. faecalis isolates, however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen detection will need to be experimentally validated (Chiu and Miller, 2019). With the development of such targets, multiple pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be identified within a single sample (Miller et al., 2019).Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study can be found in the  BioProject website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) using the BioProject ID: PRJNA587161 and the accession numbers SAMN13182395–SAMN13182398.Author Contributions NB designed the experiments, performed the research, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Although the value of the space shuttle has been controversial (Charles, 2011), one of the accomplishments of the space-shuttle era has been to establish that there are profound physiological changes during space flight (Chapes, 2004; Charles, 2011; Fagette et al., 1999; Harris et al., 2000; Ronca and Alberts, 2000; Stowe et al., 2003; Suda, 1998). In particular, we have evidence that space flight suppresses hematopoietic differentiation of macrophages and other blood cells (Ichiki et al., 1996; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992; Sonnenfeld et al., 1990; Vacek et al., 1983). Space flight has been found to decrease blood monocytes in circulation (Taylor et al., 1986), induce monocytes lacking insulin growth factor receptors (Meehan et al., 1992), and it changes leukocyte subpopulations in the bone marrow and spleen (Baqai et al., 2009; Gridley et al., 2009; Ortega et al., 2009; Pecaut et al., 2003). Decreases in the expression of the GM-CSF receptor may explain some of the in vivo physiological changes in macrophages that have been observed (Kaur et al., 2005). Space flight experiments with rodents also have revealed a diminution in the percentage and number of early blast cells (CFU-GM) in bone marrow (Sonnenfeld et al., 1990, 1992). There were also increases in the number of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow of mice assessed after the flight of STS-108 (Pecaut et al., 2003). Skeletal unloading, using antiorthostatic suspension, simulates some of the physiological changes associated with space flight (Chapes et al., 1993; Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998, 2002) also diminishes the number of macrophage progenitor cells in the bone marrow and affects hematopoiesis (Armstrong et al., 1993, 1994, 1995a; Dunn et al., 1983, 1985; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992). Therefore, there are important health issues that might arise from space flight impacts on hematopoiesis. Space flight affects cells by inducing broad physiological changes and/or it can have direct gravitational impacts on the cells themselves (Todd, 1989). We previously addressed the direct impact of space flight on macrophage differentiation at the cellular level on three different space shuttle flights (Space Transportation System (STS)-57, 60 and 62). There was increased mouse bone marrow macrophage proliferation and inhibited differentiation based on changes in expression of MHCII and Mac2 surface molecules (Armstrong et al., 1995b). Because these studies were done at less than optimal physiological temperatures (22.5–27.0 °C), there were some questions about the impact of these conditions on the outcome. During the flight of the space shuttle Endeavour, STS-126, we had an opportunity to re-examine macrophage growth and differentiation from stem cells at optimal physiological temperatures (37 °C). This experiment allowed us to assess bone marrow differentiation in vitro in the absence of the complex in vivo environment. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) may have been responsible for the effects of space flight on bone marrow macrophage differentiation. We also had an opportunity to assess global changes in transcript levels to provide insights about biochemical processes that may have been perturbed during the differentiation process.",

However, the flight conditions necessitated that the cells differentiated at less than optimal physiological temperatures (Armstrong et al., 1995b). To determine if temperature would impact macrophage growth or differentiation during the STS-126 space flight, we determined cell proliferation in two ways. Viable cell numbers were determined at day 17 in the FPA set that was kept in medium throughout the entire mission and total cell numbers were counted in FPAs that were fixed in formalin at day 14 (Fig. 1) of the STS-126 mission. When we counted cells kept in medium for the entire mission (nonpreserved), we found that we had more viable cells in the flight FPAs (3.0 ± 0.6 × 107; mean ± Sd; n = 7) compared to the ground (1.7 ± 0.4 × 107; mean ± Sd; n = 4; t-test; p < 0.01). We also found more cells in the formalin-fixed flight FPAs (5.3 ± 0.6 × 106; mean ± Sd; n = 28) compared to cell numbers in the FPAs of the ground controls (4.4 ± 0.6 × 106; mean ± Sd; n = 32; t-test; p < 0.01). Although we could not determine the viability of the fixed cells using the trypan blue exclusion test, the increase in cell number from the time the cells were fixed on day 14 to recovery on at day 17 (Fig. 1A), suggests that the cells were viable at the time of fixation. There also was a similar amount of RNA collected per cell from each of the treatment groups; 4.1 × 10−6 ng/cell. Therefore, the fixed-cell estimates appear to be accurate and there appears to be more cell proliferation of the differentiated macrophages in space than on the ground. Flight cell numbers increased an average of 5.7 fold and ground cell numbers increased an average of 3.9 fold from day 14 to day 17. We also measured glucose utilization by the cells in the unfixed FPAs. We found significantly less (p < 0.05, t-test) glucose usage by flight cells (121 ± 4 mg/dl) compared to cells grown on the ground (159 ± 3 mg/dl). These data suggest that the cells required less energy to proliferate more in space. 3.2. Assessment of macrophage phenotype after space flight We found that there was a decrease in MHCII and Mac2 cell surface molecule expression on bone marrow cells differentiated into macrophages during space flight (Armstrong et al., 1995b). In those studies, cells were differentiated at temperatures ranging from 22.5 °C to 27.0 °C. We wanted to confirm that the space-flight differences were not due to the culture temperatures and we wanted to obtain a more comprehensive phenotypic analysis of the bone marrow-derived, M-CSF-dependent macrophages that emerged. We examined the phenotype of the cells using flow cytometry. We assigned 4 subpopulations of cells based on size (forward scatter, FSC-H) and granularity (side scatter, SSC-H) (Fig. 3A and B). Region (R) 1 identified the largest, most granular cells. R4 represented the smallest, least granular cells in the differentiated cell population. The macrophages in R1 and R2 had the highest expression level of c-Fms, and F4/80 macrophage markers compared to R3 and R4 (e.g. R1+R2 vs. R3+R4: c-Fms, 105.3% vs. 44.7%; F4/80, 6.4% vs. 0.1%;Table 1). Space flight did not affect these distributions (Table 1). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Flow cytometric analysis of Flight (left column) and Ground control (right column) samples.

When we compared the distribution of cells in R1-R4 between space flight samples and ground controls we had significant differences in the expression in Ly6C, CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2 and c-Fos (p < 0.05, X2; Table 1). There was an overall decrease in Ly6C, CD11b, and c-Fos expression on cells differentiated in flight compared to those differentiated on the ground while there was an overall increase in CD31, F4/80 and Mac2 in flight cells compared to those differentiated on the ground (Table 1). We anticipated that the developing cells would have a macrophage phenotype after 15 days because the bone marrow cells were differentiated in the presence of rmM-CSF (Metcalf, 1989). Therefore, we examined the cells for the concurrent expression of c-Fms and c-Fos with Mac2 and CD44, Ly6C and Ly6G (Gr-1) with F4/80 to help establish specific macrophage differentiation stages (Table 2). We found a significant increase in the overall expression of Mac2+c-Fms+ cells and Mac2+c-Fos+ cells differentiated in space compared to ground controls (p < 0.05) and a significant change in the distribution between the two treatment groups (p < 0.05, χ2 analysis; Table 2). However, we did not see a difference in the distribution of F4/80+CD44+ cells , F4/80+Ly6C+ cells or F4/80+Gr-1+ cells (Table 2) between space-flight samples and ground controls. Table 2.

Microarray analysis To address possible mechanisms of how spaceflight affects macrophage proliferation and differentiation, we compared the transcriptional profile of bone marrow cells differentiated during space flight compared to cells differentiated on Earth. After 14 days of differentiation during space flight, the macrophages were preserved in GITC and RNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array as described in the Materials and Methods. We found that 607 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold higher for flight samples than ground controls. In contrast, we found that 1071 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold lower than ground controls (p < 0.05). The genes were sorted into biological function categories using IPA software (Table 3).

The input for the IPA analysis was upregulated genes 607 and downregulated genes 1071 genes. bGene expression data and IPA analysis was subjected to FDR (Benjamini-Holchberg) correction. P-value ranges reflect the chance genes have been randomly assigned to a specific biological function category using IPA software. cGenes may have been assigned to more than one category based on biological function classification. The unique upregulated genes were 130 and downregulated genes were 267 which were classified in the biological functional categories. Since the cells were stimulated with rmM-CSF, we were particularly interested in transcriptional regulation of genes that are involved in cell division and development (Assigned to the Cell Death, Hematopoiesis, Cellular Development, Cellular Growth and Proliferation categories in Table 3). Using IPA software (www.ingenuity.com), we found 607 unique genes that had significantly higher transcript levels and 1071 unique genes that had significantly lower transcript levels during space flight compared to ground controls within the Cell Death, Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Cellular Development and Hematopoiesis subsets (Table 3). These genes were further classified based on gene ontology (GO) annotations (Supplement 1). In particular, the genes with down regulated transcripts encoded enzymes (Lfng, LFNG O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase; Lipe, lipase, hormone-sensitive; Mettl8, methyltransferase like 8; and Adcy7 adenylate cyclase 7), growth factors (Pgf, placental growth factor; Igf1, insulin-like growth factor 1 (somatomedin C); Angpt1, angiopoietin 1; and Nrg2, neuregulin 2), Transcription factor binding (Meox2, mesenchyme homeobox 2; Mylb1, v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (avian)-like 1; Nab1, NGFI-A binding protein 1 or EGR1 binding protein 1). The genes that had significantly up regulated transcripts encoded cytokines (Ccl5; chemokine ligand 5), enzymes (Ido1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Nlgn1, neuroligin 1; Hs6st2, heparin sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2); G-protein coupled receptors (Agtr1b, angiotensin II receptor; Bdkrb2, bradykinin receptor B2) transporters (Slc7a5, soute carrier family 7; Hba-a1, hemoglobin, alpha 1, Lrp2, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2). Molecules assigned to “other” molecule function were further classified according to MGI GO assignments (Supplement 1). Analysis of the effect of space flight on the M-CSF signaling pathway revealed that gene transcripts encoding for the proteins Csf1r, Etv3, Fos, Rbl-1, Gata1, Gata2, Myc, Runx1, and E2f4 were downregulated greater than 1.5 fold in cells grown in space compared to ground controls. Alternatively, gene transcripts encoding proteins Egr1, Hoxb4 and Myb were higher in cells grown in space compared to cells maintained on Earth (Table 4). However, there were only significant differences (p < 0.05) in transcripts fold change for the genes Csf1r, E2f4, Rbl1, Egr1, Hoxb4, Gata2, Myc and Runx1. Table 4.

We also classified the gene microarray data into global canonical pathways and we selected pathways which were associated with genes whose transcription was significantly affected by the space flight. Canonical pathways were ranked based on the –log(p value) scores (p < 0.05). We found that the coagulation system (Table 5), Fc-gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and growth hormone signaling were pathways containing genes which had transcript levels that were significantly lower in flight samples compared to ground controls (1.5 fold change, p < 0.05; Supplement 2). The coagulation system had the highest – log(p value) score of any canonical pathway in this analysis. There were 6 genes which had significantly lower transcript levels in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls (p < 0.05; Table 5). In addition, 8 genes showed a trend where transcript levels were lower than ground controls even though they were not statistically different. The insulin receptor signaling pathway also had a high –log(p value) score amongst canonical signaling pathways identified by the IPA analysis. Six genes had significantly lower transcript levels in comparison to ground controls (p < 0.05;Table 6). When we examined other signaling pathways that are relevant to macrophage function (Oda et al., 2004; Raza et al., 2008), we found that several other macrophage signaling pathways also had genes that had lower transcript levels in space flight samples compared to ground controls (p < 0.05). These included Fcc receptor mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes, mTOR, CCR5 signaling, p38 map kinase, and FLT3 signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells (Supplement 2). Table 5.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion We reexamined the impact of space flight on macrophage growth and development during the space flight of STS-126 to test whether changes in the expression of the receptor for M-CSF were affected by space flight. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages proliferated faster during space flight compared to ground controls to reaffirm previous findings (Armstrong et al., 1995b) even though there were significant temperature differences between these experiments and those older experiments. The data also support observations that show that bacteria (Benoit and Klaus, 2007), plant (Matia et al., 2010) and mammalian cells (Slentz et al., 2001; Tobin et al., 2001) grow faster in space or clinorotation. The increased proliferation was not associated with a concomitant increase in glucose use to mediate that growth and supports the hypothesis that cells do not have to work as hard to grow in space. However, not all cell types respond in this same manner during space flight. Osteoblasts grew less and used less glucose than comparable ground controls on STS-56 (Hughes-Fulford and Lewis, 1996) and U937 cells depleted glucose rapidly when grown in space hardware (Hatton et al., 1999). Therefore, glucose utilization during growth may be cell-type specific. Our primary hypothesis was that the changes in growth and differentiation during space flight were due to decreased expression of the receptor for M-CSF (c-Fms); the growth factor used to induce the differentiation of macrophages from bone marrow stem cells. We found that the transcript level of Csfr was lower in space flight samples compared to ground controls. However, when we examined the level of c-Fms molecules on the surface of the cells by flow cytometry, we found an increase in the receptor. This conundrum could be explained by increased protein translation efficiency during space flight. Factors such as protein concentration affect translational efficiency (Morgan et al., 1971), and the lack of convection in space could affect local concentrations of M-CSF as well as other cytokines. Signal transduction can also be altered by space flight (Akiyama et al., 1999; Cogoli, 1997; De Groot et al., 1991, Hatton, Gaubert, 1999, Nickerson et al., 2000; Schwarzenberg, 1999) and the efficiency of protein synthesis can be altered by cytokines and growth factors and their coordinating pathways (Hornberger and Esser, 2004). However, Etheridge et al. found that the components that control the RNAi process that regulate translation and the inhibitory effects of RNAi were unaffected by space flight (Etheridge et al., 2011). Therefore, questioning the efficiency of translation may not be appropriate. Alternatively, the discrepancy between the transcript level and protein level could have resulted from when we measured these processes. Csfr transcripts are stabilized during macrophage differentiation (Stone et al., 1990) and c-Fms plasma membrane levels are generally stable and dependent on the concentration of M-CSF present (Rettenmier et al., 1987). Therefore, the macrophages in our space culture FPAs may have had more c-Fms molecules present because there was less rmM-CSF remaining in those FPAs. Unfortunately, we did not assay for M-CSF in the cultures from this experiment. We found very low levels of all the cytokines we did perform assays for (GM-CSF, IL-1, TNF, IL-6, data not shown). By 15 days of culture, the supernatants were generally devoid of labile cytokines. We also did not have enough RNA left over after the gene array to validate the Csfr transcript concentrations. We note, however, that Runx1 transcript levels were also significantly lower in the space-flown cells. There is a strong correlation in expression between Csfr and Runx1, (Himes et al., 2005) which helps to increase our confidence in these data. Nevertheless, additional work will be needed to resolve this issue. The increased number Mac2+c-Fms+ cells and the generally increased expression of F4/80 on the macrophages differentiated in space suggests that there is a more differentiated population of cells present after space flight. F4/80 (Caminschi et al., 2001; Hume et al., 2002) and Mac2 (Dong and Hughes, 1997; Ho and Springer, 1982) are macrophage-specific markers that tend to increase as macrophages mature (Leenen et al., 1990, 1994). A decrease in Ly6C in the total, R1 and R2 populations in the cells we identified would also support this conclusion since Ly6C identifies myeloid cells at an intermediate stages of differentiation (Leenen et al., 1994). However, other data related to the differentiation state of the macrophages in our space cultures were not consistent with this conclusion. We did not see a decrease in the Ly6G or CD31 expression on the macrophages flown in space. Ly6G is expressed on macrophages early in differentiation, granulocytes and other cells (Ammon et al., 2000; Ferret-Bernard et al., 2004; Leenen et al., 1990) and CD31 is expressed on macrophages early in differentiation and decreases as they mature (de Bruijn et al., 1994; de Bruijn et al., 1998; Watt et al., 1993). We also did not see an increase in CD11b or in the F4/80+Ly6C− or the F4/80+Ly6G− populations. These latter two populations should have increased as macrophages became more differentiated. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to say that the macrophages that develop in space are different from those that develop on the Earth even though we can not necessarily characterize them as more or less differentiated from each other. This conclusion would not contradict data from STS-57, STS-60 and STS-62 (Armstrong et al., 1995b). Moreover, when we assessed the relative levels of transcripts of transcription factors (Sfpi1, Egr1, Myc, Stat3, Tnf, Hoxb7, Cebpb, Runx1, Chrac1, Egr1, Irf1, Jun, and Fos) that are necessary for the differentiation of M-CFU into macrophages (Valledor et al., 1998), we found that most of these were not significantly up or down regulated (>1.5 fold) in the space-flight samples compared to ground controls. This suggests that space flight was not affecting the differentiation of the macrophages. There were significant changes in transcript levels of 1678 genes in macrophages that develop in space compared to those that develop on Earth. These data suggest that space flight has an effect on M-CSF-stimulated macrophages in vitro. The array of gene transcripts that were altered suggests that there were global impacts on the cells; not just on specific molecular signaling pathways. Nevertheless, when we examined pathways particularly relevant to bone marrow macrophage growth and differentiation, i.e. the M-CSF signaling pathway, there were transcript changes that were consistent with increased cellular proliferation. For example, the down regulation of Rbl-1 (encodes p107) in the M-CSF pathway in the flight cells is consistent with the increased proliferation of myeloid cells in p107 knockout mice (LeCouter et al., 1998). Similarly, the significant down regulation of E2f4 would also be consistent with increased proliferation. E2f4 regulates the cell cycle and inhibits cell proliferation (Attwooll et al., 2004). Mutations in E2f4 lead to hematological cancers (Komatsu et al., 2000) because of its role in regulating cell fate (Enos et al., 2008). Furthermore, if one examines the transcript levels of transcription factors that are activated during the differentiation of stem cells into M-CFU macrophage progenitors (Valledor, Borras, 1998), only Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 were up regulated and only Hoxb4 was significant (>1.5 fold increase; p < 0.05). Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 are necessary for myeloid cell proliferation (Bjornsson et al., 2003; Sauvageau et al., 1997) but are not needed for lineage commitment (Bjornsson et al., 2003). In contrast, two of the three transcription factors that are significantly down regulated during early macrophage differentiation in space flight samples (Gata2 and Runx1) are either not needed for macrophage terminal differentiation (Gata2) (Tsai and Orkin, 1997) or serve as an inhibitor of proliferation (Runx1) (Himes et al., 2005). Interestingly, Myc was also down regulated and macrophage proliferation is also driven by c-Myc protein (Wickstrom et al., 1988; Yu et al., 2005). This inconsistency might be because c-Myc is needed early in macrophage proliferative response during differentiation (Valledor et al., 1998) and we were already 15 days into the differentiation process. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that transcripts of other key inducers of proliferation such as cyclophilin A (Ppia) and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2) also trended lower in space-flight samples (Ppia, −1.11 fold change; Cdk2, −1.26 fold change) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Cdkn1a), an inhibitor of cellular proliferation trended with higher transcript levels in space-flight cells (Cdkn2a, −1.32 fold change). It appears that the proliferative phase was in the process of changing by the 15th day of culture. The most interesting revelation of the IPA analysis of the transcriptional array of bone marrow macrophage differentiation in space was the broad impact of space flight on the coagulation pathway. Sixteen genes were down regulated in toto. Genes encoding proteins involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were affected; indicating a broad impact. Kimzey et al. suggested that there may be a “hypercoagulative condition” after the flight of the Skylab astronauts (Kimzey et al., 1975b). However, after closer examination of the data from Skylab missions (Kimzey, 1977; Kimzey et al., 1975a, 1975b, 1976), it appears that this hypothesis was based on observations of platelets and not coagulation-pathway proteins. If there are alterations in the ability of space travelers to coagulate blood, this could have ramifications on astronaut recovery from injury from bleeding, angiogenesis and inflammation. For example, fragments of plasminogen (encoded by Plg), which had significantly lower transcript concentrations in flight samples compared to ground controls, inhibit angiogenesis (O’Reilly et al., 1994) and are involved in regulating macrophage migration (Gong et al., 2008). Additional examination of these systems in vivo is justified.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusion We have confirmed that space flight has a significant impact on murine bone marrow macrophages in vitro. We see significant increases in cell proliferation and changes in the pattern of expression of cell-surface differentiation antigens. Differences in gene expression in 1678 genes in the differentiating macrophages during space flight are consistent with this observation. Importantly, these changes do not appear to be from decreases in the surface expression of the receptor for M-CSF. We recently found that there are changes in bone marrow subpopulations in mice after they are subjected to space flight (Ortega et al., 2009). The data from STS-126 indicates that there can also be direct gravitational effects on those bone marrow cells. The long-term effects of these changes have yet to be determined and should be the focus of appropriate studies on the International Space Station.",

Copyright notice ID: 3570223 MSID: MS361876 PMID: 23420085 The publisher's version of this article is available at Adv Space Res Abstract We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells. Keywords: Gene expression, Differentiation, Macrophage colony stimulating factors, STS-1261. Introduction Although the value of the space shuttle has been controversial (Charles, 2011), one of the accomplishments of the space-shuttle era has been to establish that there are profound physiological changes during space flight (Chapes, 2004; Charles, 2011; Fagette et al., 1999; Harris et al., 2000; Ronca and Alberts, 2000; Stowe et al., 2003; Suda, 1998). In particular, we have evidence that space flight suppresses hematopoietic differentiation of macrophages and other blood cells (Ichiki et al., 1996; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992; Sonnenfeld et al., 1990; Vacek et al., 1983). Space flight has been found to decrease blood monocytes in circulation (Taylor et al., 1986), induce monocytes lacking insulin growth factor receptors (Meehan et al., 1992), and it changes leukocyte subpopulations in the bone marrow and spleen (Baqai et al., 2009; Gridley et al., 2009; Ortega et al., 2009; Pecaut et al., 2003). Decreases in the expression of the GM-CSF receptor may explain some of the in vivo physiological changes in macrophages that have been observed (Kaur et al., 2005). Space flight experiments with rodents also have revealed a diminution in the percentage and number of early blast cells (CFU-GM) in bone marrow (Sonnenfeld et al., 1990, 1992). There were also increases in the number of CD34+ cells in the bone marrow of mice assessed after the flight of STS-108 (Pecaut et al., 2003). Skeletal unloading, using antiorthostatic suspension, simulates some of the physiological changes associated with space flight (Chapes et al., 1993; Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998, 2002) also diminishes the number of macrophage progenitor cells in the bone marrow and affects hematopoiesis (Armstrong et al., 1993, 1994, 1995a; Dunn et al., 1983, 1985; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992). Therefore, there are important health issues that might arise from space flight impacts on hematopoiesis. Space flight affects cells by inducing broad physiological changes and/or it can have direct gravitational impacts on the cells themselves (Todd, 1989). We previously addressed the direct impact of space flight on macrophage differentiation at the cellular level on three different space shuttle flights (Space Transportation System (STS)-57, 60 and 62). There was increased mouse bone marrow macrophage proliferation and inhibited differentiation based on changes in expression of MHCII and Mac2 surface molecules (Armstrong et al., 1995b). Because these studies were done at less than optimal physiological temperatures (22.5–27.0 °C), there were some questions about the impact of these conditions on the outcome. During the flight of the space shuttle Endeavour, STS-126, we had an opportunity to re-examine macrophage growth and differentiation from stem cells at optimal physiological temperatures (37 °C). This experiment allowed us to assess bone marrow differentiation in vitro in the absence of the complex in vivo environment. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) may have been responsible for the effects of space flight on bone marrow macrophage differentiation. We also had an opportunity to assess global changes in transcript levels to provide insights about biochemical processes that may have been perturbed during the differentiation process.2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Purifiedanti c-Fms (Clone 20), purified – anti IgG, PE- anti IgG, PE- anti c-Fos (Clone 4) and PE- anti IgG2b (Clone not categorized) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).2.2. Bone marrow cells and assay set up Bone marrow cells were harvested from humeri, femora, and tibiae of adult C57BL/6 mice (>8-week old; n = 21) originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in the animal facility at Kansas State University (KSU) (Armstrong et al., 1993). All animal experiments were approved by Kansas State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Briefly, the bones were recovered and cleaned of all nonosseous tissue. The marrow cavity was flushed with a sterile PBS solution. The red blood cells were lysed by incubating in ammonium chloride lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.3) for 5 min at 4 °C. Pooled cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min) and washed two times with Dulbecco’s Modified Minimal Essentials Medium (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% Nu serum (BD, Bedford, MA), Glutamine plus (2 mM, Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 0.1 M HEPES and 10% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, N.Y.)(DMEM2). Primary bone marrow cells were suspended in DMEM2 supplemented with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor (rmM-CSF; 1.5 ug/ml, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in preparation for culture in Fluid Processing Apparatus hardware (FPAs; Fig. 1B) (Armstrong et al., 1995b; Hoehn et al., 2004; Luttges, 1992; Wilson et al., 2007). Briefly, FPAs are 11.70 cm long and 1.35 cm diameter (1.31 mm glass thickness) glass barrels. The FPAs have a bypass which allows for the transfer of media from one chamber to another. The FPAs were siliconized with Rain-X (Blue Coral-Slick 50, Ltd; Cleveland, OH) and fitted with a previously siliconized rubber septum, 1.2 cm from the distal end of the barrel. Bacti-caps (16-mm diam.; Oxford Labware, St. Louis, MO) were placed on the proximal end of the FPAs before sterilization. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab A. Time-line of activities for bone marrow macrophage differentiation on STS-126. B. Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA). 3.0 ml of cells were placed in a chamber 1 separated by two rubber septa. The FPA is engineered with a bypass so that when the internal assembly of septa and biological samples are pushed to the left the medium in the second chamber will mix with the material in chamber 1 and septa 2 and 3 will compress. Septa 3 and 4 also compress with additional movement to mix the contents of chamber 3 with the contents previously mixed.The bone marrow cells were loaded into the primary chamber of 48 FPAs (1 × 107 cells per 3 ml DMEM2 supplemented with rmM-CSF). A second chamber was formed by sliding a sterile, siliconized septum parallel to the first septum. Excess air was evacuated through a 26GA needle. DMEM2 supplemented rmM-CSF was loaded into the second chamber of all 48 FPAs. A third chamber was formed by adding an additional septum similarly to the second. Thirty-two FPAs were loaded with 8% formalin. Eight FPAs were loaded with 6.0 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) (Woods and Chapes, 1994) and 8 FPAs were loaded with DMEM2 plus rmM-CSF (returned as viable cultures). The third chambers were sealed with septa as described above. The FPAs were transported (day-2 of spaceflight, Fig. 1A) at 4 °C to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Life Sciences Laboratory Facility (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The FPAs were loaded into 6 Group Activation Packs (GAPs) (Hoehn, Klaus, 2004), 8 FPAs/GAP. GAPs were placed into the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) (Hoehn et al., 2004; Woods and Chapes, 1994)) at 37 °C to start incubation. Parallel temperature and activation profile conditions were maintained on GAPs kept at the SLSL. The incubation was started before the launch of space shuttle (Endeavour) flight Space Transportation System (STS)-126 (day -1 of spaceflight,Fig. 1A). On day 6 of cell differentiation (day 5 of spaceflight, Fig. 1), 1.5 ml of DMEM2 supplemented with rmM-CSF was added to the cell suspension by mixing chambers 1 and 2 of the FPAs through the bypass (Hoehn et al., 2004). On day 15 of cell differentiation (day 14 of spaceflight) the content of the FPAs third chamber was mixed with the cell suspension in the previously merged chambers. STS-126 landing occurred in California 17 days after the start of 37 °C cell culture incubation (day 16 of spaceflight). Samples were placed at 4 °C and transported to SLSL in Florida. The FPAs were unloaded from GAPs, inspected, and the cells in medium were collected from 8 FPAs and viable cells (trypan blue exclusion) were counted on a hemacytometer. Cell-free media were collected from these FPA and were frozen and sent to KSU. Glucose content was measured in each sample using a digital glucometer (Home Diagnostics, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL). FPAs prepared to fix cells in formalin or GITC were transported to KSU at 4 °C and were processed 19 days after the cells were place at 37 °C to begin differentiation. Total cell counts were done on formalin-fixed cells.2.3. Flow cytometry At KSU, bone marrow cells fixed in formalin were washed in Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) and counted and cell concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 107 cells per ml. Phenotypic analysis of bone marrow-derived cells was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as has been described previously by our group (Ortega et al., 2009; Potts et al., 2008). Five hundred thousand bone marrow cells were blocked with PBS:goat serum (50:50; 50 μl) at 4 °C for 0.5 h. AF647- anti Mac2 or anti IgG2a (0.5 μg), FITC- anti Ly6C or anti IgM (0.5 μg), PE- anti CD11b or anti IgG2b (0.1 μg) , APC- anti CD31 or anti IgG2a (0.5 μg), APC- anti CD3 or anti IgG1 (1 μg), PE- anti Ly6G or anti IgG2b (0.1 μg), APC- anti F4/80 or anti IgG2a (1.4 μg), PE- anti CD44 or anti IgG2b (1 μg), purified- anti c-Fms or anti IgG (0.25 μg), and PE- anti c-Fos or anti IgG2b (3.8 μg) were added to the cell suspensions and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. In some instances, multiplexing of antibodies with compatible flurochromes was done (e.g. c-Fos and CD31 or Ly6C and CD31). The cells were then washed twice in HBSS and resuspended in HBSS containing 1% formalin. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickson. Rockville, MD) and a minimum of 20,000 events were collected for each sample.2.4. Microarray analysis At KSU, bone marrow cells preserved in GITC were combined in pools of 2 FPAs per sample to provide four independent flight and four ground samples for assessment. RNA was phenol extracted and purified in the aqueous phase using phase-lock tubes (5-prime, Gaithersburg, MD) centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min. RNA was ethanol precipitated and DNase treated (Qiagen RNeasy). Frozen RNA was sent to the University of Kansas microarray facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS). At the facility, RNA concentrations and qualities were analyzed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 pico assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Based on RNA quality, the four best RNA samples were selected (Flight A 21.2 ng, RNA Integrity Value (RIN), 3; Flight D 25 ng, RIN, 3; Ground B 12.5 ng, RIN, 3; Ground D 24.1 ng, RIN, 3). All available RNA was concentrated and processed for target labeling using the 2x IVT labeling protocol. Briefly, the two round RNA amplification and labeling procedure was performed using the Affymetrix Small Sample Labeling Protocol vII (2xIVT) as follows: 50 ng of total RNA was primed with T7-oligo(dT) promoter primer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase vII kit (Invitrogen). The first round of RNA amplification was performed on the cDNA using the MEGAScript T7 Invitro-Transciption kit (Ambion). Amplified RNA (aRNA) was reverse transcribed using random primers and SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase vII kit. The second round RNA amplification and biotin labeling was conducted using the GeneChip 3′ IVT labeling kit (Affymetrix). Biotin labeled aRNA was fragmented and hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0, 3′ expression array (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Array washing and staining was conducted using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 followed by a 1x scan with the GeneChip 3000 Scanner 7G with Autoloader. GeneChip processing and data collection was performed using GeneChip Operating System v1.4 (GCOS). Probe intensities were consistent amongst the 4 samples and correlation coefficients among the samples were all greater than 0.95. Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 CHP files were imported into GeneSpring GX11 and were transformed to log2 based to create a Flight vs. Ground data comparison. We performed gene-level analysis with Advanced Workflow with GeneSpring software. A 50 percentile shift normalization algorithm (Yang et al., 2002) was applied to the samples. The correlation coefficients within each treatment group were between 0.9759831 and 0.9926981. The box plot (Fig. 2A) of Flight and Ground groups shows some extreme values above the maximum value in both data sets. From the Principal Component Analysis plot (Fig. 2B), we confirmed some sample-to-sample variation but there were additional variable differences between Flight and Ground treatments. ANOVA without Multiple Testing Correction was applied and 1678 significant genes out of 28,972 total genes were selected at a p-value < 0.05 with up or down gene-level fold changes greater than 1.5 (Fig. 2C)(Dudoit et al., 2002). To reduce the Type I Error, we performed ANOVA again with the Benjamini Hochberg FDR of Multiple Testing Correction method with cut-off 0.05 on 1678 genes (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We obtained 1678 genes with corrected p-values between 0.00165 and 0.04998. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Analyses of data from microarray.

Dark dots represent genes that have >1.5 fold-change (x-axis) as well as high statistical significance cut off with a p-value < 0.05 (y-axis). The gray dots represent genes that are not significantly different.The data sets that were uploaded into Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) 9.0 software were: 1678 significant genes with corrected p values < 0.05 and fold changes > 1.5; 28,972 “all” genes from the Affymetrix array, and 137 genes which were related to cell growth and proliferation. All input data sets consisted of three data columns, “Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array probe ID, p-value, and Fold Change”. While running a “Core Analysis” to the dataset, the “Filters and General Settings” were set up for the analysis. “Direct” and “Indirect Relationships” were included as interactions and “endogenous chemicals (metabolites)” in the network analysis, all the data sources were selected, and “Mouse” as the species. The IPA result panel included: “Summary, Networks, Functions, Canonical Pathways, Lists, My Pathways, Molecules, Network Explorer, and Overlapping Networks”. We focused on “Networks, Functions, and Canonical Pathways”.

Statistical analysis Data were evaluated by Student’s t-test or by Chi-Square (χ2) test (Statmost, Detaxiom Software Inc, Los Angeles, CA). P-values of <0.05 were selected to indicate significance. The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (Sd) of the replicate number.3. Results 3.1. Cell growth studies In previous work, we found that macrophage growth was enhanced by space flight. However, the flight conditions necessitated that the cells differentiated at less than optimal physiological temperatures (Armstrong et al., 1995b). To determine if temperature would impact macrophage growth or differentiation during the STS-126 space flight, we determined cell proliferation in two ways. Viable cell numbers were determined at day 17 in the FPA set that was kept in medium throughout the entire mission and total cell numbers were counted in FPAs that were fixed in formalin at day 14 (Fig. 1) of the STS-126 mission. When we counted cells kept in medium for the entire mission (nonpreserved), we found that we had more viable cells in the flight FPAs (3.0 ± 0.6 × 107; mean ± Sd; n = 7) compared to the ground (1.7 ± 0.4 × 107; mean ± Sd; n = 4; t-test; p < 0.01). We also found more cells in the formalin-fixed flight FPAs (5.3 ± 0.6 × 106; mean ± Sd; n = 28) compared to cell numbers in the FPAs of the ground controls (4.4 ± 0.6 × 106; mean ± Sd; n = 32; t-test; p < 0.01). Although we could not determine the viability of the fixed cells using the trypan blue exclusion test, the increase in cell number from the time the cells were fixed on day 14 to recovery on at day 17 (Fig. 1A), suggests that the cells were viable at the time of fixation. There also was a similar amount of RNA collected per cell from each of the treatment groups; 4.1 × 10−6 ng/cell. Therefore, the fixed-cell estimates appear to be accurate and there appears to be more cell proliferation of the differentiated macrophages in space than on the ground. Flight cell numbers increased an average of 5.7 fold and ground cell numbers increased an average of 3.9 fold from day 14 to day 17. We also measured glucose utilization by the cells in the unfixed FPAs. We found significantly less (p < 0.05, t-test) glucose usage by flight cells (121 ± 4 mg/dl) compared to cells grown on the ground (159 ± 3 mg/dl). These data suggest that the cells required less energy to proliferate more in space.3.2. Assessment of macrophage phenotype after space flight We found that there was a decrease in MHCII and Mac2 cell surface molecule expression on bone marrow cells differentiated into macrophages during space flight (Armstrong et al., 1995b). In those studies, cells were differentiated at temperatures ranging from 22.5 °C to 27.0 °C. We wanted to confirm that the space-flight differences were not due to the culture temperatures and we wanted to obtain a more comprehensive phenotypic analysis of the bone marrow-derived, M-CSF-dependent macrophages that emerged. We examined the phenotype of the cells using flow cytometry. We assigned 4 subpopulations of cells based on size (forward scatter, FSC-H) and granularity (side scatter, SSC-H) (Fig. 3A and B). Region (R) 1 identified the largest, most granular cells. R4 represented the smallest, least granular cells in the differentiated cell population. The macrophages in R1 and R2 had the highest expression level of c-Fms, and F4/80 macrophage markers compared to R3 and R4 (e.g. R1+R2 vs. R3+R4: c-Fms, 105.3% vs. 44.7%; F4/80, 6.4% vs. 0.1%;Table 1). Space flight did not affect these distributions (Table 1). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Flow cytometric analysis of Flight (left column) and Ground control (right column) samples.

When we compared the distribution of cells in R1-R4 between space flight samples and ground controls we had significant differences in the expression in Ly6C, CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2 and c-Fos (p < 0.05, X2; Table 1). There was an overall decrease in Ly6C, CD11b, and c-Fos expression on cells differentiated in flight compared to those differentiated on the ground while there was an overall increase in CD31, F4/80 and Mac2 in flight cells compared to those differentiated on the ground (Table 1). We anticipated that the developing cells would have a macrophage phenotype after 15 days because the bone marrow cells were differentiated in the presence of rmM-CSF (Metcalf, 1989). Therefore, we examined the cells for the concurrent expression of c-Fms and c-Fos with Mac2 and CD44, Ly6C and Ly6G (Gr-1) with F4/80 to help establish specific macrophage differentiation stages (Table 2). We found a significant increase in the overall expression of Mac2+c-Fms+ cells and Mac2+c-Fos+ cells differentiated in space compared to ground controls (p < 0.05) and a significant change in the distribution between the two treatment groups (p < 0.05, χ2 analysis; Table 2). However, we did not see a difference in the distribution of F4/80+CD44+ cells , F4/80+Ly6C+ cells or F4/80+Gr-1+ cells (Table 2) between space-flight samples and ground controls. Table 2.

Microarray analysis To address possible mechanisms of how spaceflight affects macrophage proliferation and differentiation, we compared the transcriptional profile of bone marrow cells differentiated during space flight compared to cells differentiated on Earth. After 14 days of differentiation during space flight, the macrophages were preserved in GITC and RNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array as described in the Materials and Methods. We found that 607 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold higher for flight samples than ground controls. In contrast, we found that 1071 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold lower than ground controls (p < 0.05). The genes were sorted into biological function categories using IPA software (Table 3). These included genes involved in Carbohydrate metabolism, Cellular development, Hematopoiesis, Cellullar growth and proliferation, Lipid metabolism and many other functions (Table 3). Table 3.

The input for the IPA analysis was upregulated genes 607 and downregulated genes 1071 genes. bGene expression data and IPA analysis was subjected to FDR (Benjamini-Holchberg) correction. P-value ranges reflect the chance genes have been randomly assigned to a specific biological function category using IPA software. cGenes may have been assigned to more than one category based on biological function classification. The unique upregulated genes were 130 and downregulated genes were 267 which were classified in the biological functional categories. Since the cells were stimulated with rmM-CSF, we were particularly interested in transcriptional regulation of genes that are involved in cell division and development (Assigned to the Cell Death, Hematopoiesis, Cellular Development, Cellular Growth and Proliferation categories in Table 3). Using IPA software (www.ingenuity.com), we found 607 unique genes that had significantly higher transcript levels and 1071 unique genes that had significantly lower transcript levels during space flight compared to ground controls within the Cell Death, Cellular Growth and Proliferation, Cellular Development and Hematopoiesis subsets (Table 3). These genes were further classified based on gene ontology (GO) annotations (Supplement 1). In particular, the genes with down regulated transcripts encoded enzymes (Lfng, LFNG O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase; Lipe, lipase, hormone-sensitive; Mettl8, methyltransferase like 8; and Adcy7 adenylate cyclase 7), growth factors (Pgf, placental growth factor; Igf1, insulin-like growth factor 1 (somatomedin C); Angpt1, angiopoietin 1; and Nrg2, neuregulin 2), Transcription factor binding (Meox2, mesenchyme homeobox 2; Mylb1, v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (avian)-like 1; Nab1, NGFI-A binding protein 1 or EGR1 binding protein 1). The genes that had significantly up regulated transcripts encoded cytokines (Ccl5; chemokine ligand 5), enzymes (Ido1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; Nlgn1, neuroligin 1; Hs6st2, heparin sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2); G-protein coupled receptors (Agtr1b, angiotensin II receptor; Bdkrb2, bradykinin receptor B2) transporters (Slc7a5, soute carrier family 7; Hba-a1, hemoglobin, alpha 1, Lrp2, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2). Molecules assigned to “other” molecule function were further classified according to MGI GO assignments (Supplement 1). Analysis of the effect of space flight on the M-CSF signaling pathway revealed that gene transcripts encoding for the proteins Csf1r, Etv3, Fos, Rbl-1, Gata1, Gata2, Myc, Runx1, and E2f4 were downregulated greater than 1.5 fold in cells grown in space compared to ground controls. Alternatively, gene transcripts encoding proteins Egr1, Hoxb4 and Myb were higher in cells grown in space compared to cells maintained on Earth (Table 4). However, there were only significant differences (p < 0.05) in transcripts fold change for the genes Csf1r, E2f4, Rbl1, Egr1, Hoxb4, Gata2, Myc and Runx1. Table 4.

We also classified the gene microarray data into global canonical pathways and we selected pathways which were associated with genes whose transcription was significantly affected by the space flight. Canonical pathways were ranked based on the –log(p value) scores (p < 0.05). We found that the coagulation system (Table 5), Fc-gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and growth hormone signaling were pathways containing genes which had transcript levels that were significantly lower in flight samples compared to ground controls (1.5 fold change, p < 0.05; Supplement 2). The coagulation system had the highest – log(p value) score of any canonical pathway in this analysis. There were 6 genes which had significantly lower transcript levels in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls (p < 0.05; Table 5). In addition, 8 genes showed a trend where transcript levels were lower than ground controls even though they were not statistically different. The insulin receptor signaling pathway also had a high –log(p value) score amongst canonical signaling pathways identified by the IPA analysis. Six genes had significantly lower transcript levels in comparison to ground controls (p < 0.05;Table 6). When we examined other signaling pathways that are relevant to macrophage function (Oda et al., 2004; Raza et al., 2008), we found that several other macrophage signaling pathways also had genes that had lower transcript levels in space flight samples compared to ground controls (p < 0.05). These included Fcc receptor mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and monocytes, mTOR, CCR5 signaling, p38 map kinase, and FLT3 signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells (Supplement 2). Table 5.

Discussion We reexamined the impact of space flight on macrophage growth and development during the space flight of STS-126 to test whether changes in the expression of the receptor for M-CSF were affected by space flight. We found that bone marrow-derived macrophages proliferated faster during space flight compared to ground controls to reaffirm previous findings (Armstrong et al., 1995b) even though there were significant temperature differences between these experiments and those older experiments. The data also support observations that show that bacteria (Benoit and Klaus, 2007), plant (Matia et al., 2010) and mammalian cells (Slentz et al., 2001; Tobin et al., 2001) grow faster in space or clinorotation. The increased proliferation was not associated with a concomitant increase in glucose use to mediate that growth and supports the hypothesis that cells do not have to work as hard to grow in space. However, not all cell types respond in this same manner during space flight. Osteoblasts grew less and used less glucose than comparable ground controls on STS-56 (Hughes-Fulford and Lewis, 1996) and U937 cells depleted glucose rapidly when grown in space hardware (Hatton et al., 1999). Therefore, glucose utilization during growth may be cell-type specific. Our primary hypothesis was that the changes in growth and differentiation during space flight were due to decreased expression of the receptor for M-CSF (c-Fms); the growth factor used to induce the differentiation of macrophages from bone marrow stem cells. We found that the transcript level of Csfr was lower in space flight samples compared to ground controls. However, when we examined the level of c-Fms molecules on the surface of the cells by flow cytometry, we found an increase in the receptor. This conundrum could be explained by increased protein translation efficiency during space flight. Factors such as protein concentration affect translational efficiency (Morgan et al., 1971), and the lack of convection in space could affect local concentrations of M-CSF as well as other cytokines. Signal transduction can also be altered by space flight (Akiyama et al., 1999; Cogoli, 1997; De Groot et al., 1991, Hatton, Gaubert, 1999, Nickerson et al., 2000; Schwarzenberg, 1999) and the efficiency of protein synthesis can be altered by cytokines and growth factors and their coordinating pathways (Hornberger and Esser, 2004). However, Etheridge et al. found that the components that control the RNAi process that regulate translation and the inhibitory effects of RNAi were unaffected by space flight (Etheridge et al., 2011). Therefore, questioning the efficiency of translation may not be appropriate. Alternatively, the discrepancy between the transcript level and protein level could have resulted from when we measured these processes. Csfr transcripts are stabilized during macrophage differentiation (Stone et al., 1990) and c-Fms plasma membrane levels are generally stable and dependent on the concentration of M-CSF present (Rettenmier et al., 1987). Therefore, the macrophages in our space culture FPAs may have had more c-Fms molecules present because there was less rmM-CSF remaining in those FPAs. Unfortunately, we did not assay for M-CSF in the cultures from this experiment. We found very low levels of all the cytokines we did perform assays for (GM-CSF, IL-1, TNF, IL-6, data not shown). By 15 days of culture, the supernatants were generally devoid of labile cytokines. We also did not have enough RNA left over after the gene array to validate the Csfr transcript concentrations. We note, however, that Runx1 transcript levels were also significantly lower in the space-flown cells. There is a strong correlation in expression between Csfr and Runx1, (Himes et al., 2005) which helps to increase our confidence in these data. Nevertheless, additional work will be needed to resolve this issue. The increased number Mac2+c-Fms+ cells and the generally increased expression of F4/80 on the macrophages differentiated in space suggests that there is a more differentiated population of cells present after space flight. F4/80 (Caminschi et al., 2001; Hume et al., 2002) and Mac2 (Dong and Hughes, 1997; Ho and Springer, 1982) are macrophage-specific markers that tend to increase as macrophages mature (Leenen et al., 1990, 1994). A decrease in Ly6C in the total, R1 and R2 populations in the cells we identified would also support this conclusion since Ly6C identifies myeloid cells at an intermediate stages of differentiation (Leenen et al., 1994). However, other data related to the differentiation state of the macrophages in our space cultures were not consistent with this conclusion. We did not see a decrease in the Ly6G or CD31 expression on the macrophages flown in space. Ly6G is expressed on macrophages early in differentiation, granulocytes and other cells (Ammon et al., 2000; Ferret-Bernard et al., 2004; Leenen et al., 1990) and CD31 is expressed on macrophages early in differentiation and decreases as they mature (de Bruijn et al., 1994; de Bruijn et al., 1998; Watt et al., 1993). We also did not see an increase in CD11b or in the F4/80+Ly6C− or the F4/80+Ly6G− populations. These latter two populations should have increased as macrophages became more differentiated. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to say that the macrophages that develop in space are different from those that develop on the Earth even though we can not necessarily characterize them as more or less differentiated from each other. This conclusion would not contradict data from STS-57, STS-60 and STS-62 (Armstrong et al., 1995b). Moreover, when we assessed the relative levels of transcripts of transcription factors (Sfpi1, Egr1, Myc, Stat3, Tnf, Hoxb7, Cebpb, Runx1, Chrac1, Egr1, Irf1, Jun, and Fos) that are necessary for the differentiation of M-CFU into macrophages (Valledor et al., 1998), we found that most of these were not significantly up or down regulated (>1.5 fold) in the space-flight samples compared to ground controls. This suggests that space flight was not affecting the differentiation of the macrophages. There were significant changes in transcript levels of 1678 genes in macrophages that develop in space compared to those that develop on Earth. These data suggest that space flight has an effect on M-CSF-stimulated macrophages in vitro. The array of gene transcripts that were altered suggests that there were global impacts on the cells; not just on specific molecular signaling pathways. Nevertheless, when we examined pathways particularly relevant to bone marrow macrophage growth and differentiation, i.e. the M-CSF signaling pathway, there were transcript changes that were consistent with increased cellular proliferation. For example, the down regulation of Rbl-1 (encodes p107) in the M-CSF pathway in the flight cells is consistent with the increased proliferation of myeloid cells in p107 knockout mice (LeCouter et al., 1998). Similarly, the significant down regulation of E2f4 would also be consistent with increased proliferation. E2f4 regulates the cell cycle and inhibits cell proliferation (Attwooll et al., 2004). Mutations in E2f4 lead to hematological cancers (Komatsu et al., 2000) because of its role in regulating cell fate (Enos et al., 2008). Furthermore, if one examines the transcript levels of transcription factors that are activated during the differentiation of stem cells into M-CFU macrophage progenitors (Valledor, Borras, 1998), only Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 were up regulated and only Hoxb4 was significant (>1.5 fold increase; p < 0.05). Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 are necessary for myeloid cell proliferation (Bjornsson et al., 2003; Sauvageau et al., 1997) but are not needed for lineage commitment (Bjornsson et al., 2003). In contrast, two of the three transcription factors that are significantly down regulated during early macrophage differentiation in space flight samples (Gata2 and Runx1) are either not needed for macrophage terminal differentiation (Gata2) (Tsai and Orkin, 1997) or serve as an inhibitor of proliferation (Runx1) (Himes et al., 2005). Interestingly, Myc was also down regulated and macrophage proliferation is also driven by c-Myc protein (Wickstrom et al., 1988; Yu et al., 2005). This inconsistency might be because c-Myc is needed early in macrophage proliferative response during differentiation (Valledor et al., 1998) and we were already 15 days into the differentiation process. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that transcripts of other key inducers of proliferation such as cyclophilin A (Ppia) and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2) also trended lower in space-flight samples (Ppia, −1.11 fold change; Cdk2, −1.26 fold change) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (Cdkn1a), an inhibitor of cellular proliferation trended with higher transcript levels in space-flight cells (Cdkn2a, −1.32 fold change). It appears that the proliferative phase was in the process of changing by the 15th day of culture. The most interesting revelation of the IPA analysis of the transcriptional array of bone marrow macrophage differentiation in space was the broad impact of space flight on the coagulation pathway. Sixteen genes were down regulated in toto. Genes encoding proteins involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were affected; indicating a broad impact. Kimzey et al. suggested that there may be a “hypercoagulative condition” after the flight of the Skylab astronauts (Kimzey et al., 1975b). However, after closer examination of the data from Skylab missions (Kimzey, 1977; Kimzey et al., 1975a, 1975b, 1976), it appears that this hypothesis was based on observations of platelets and not coagulation-pathway proteins. If there are alterations in the ability of space travelers to coagulate blood, this could have ramifications on astronaut recovery from injury from bleeding, angiogenesis and inflammation. For example, fragments of plasminogen (encoded by Plg), which had significantly lower transcript concentrations in flight samples compared to ground controls, inhibit angiogenesis (O’Reilly et al., 1994) and are involved in regulating macrophage migration (Gong et al., 2008). Additional examination of these systems in vivo is justified.5. Conclusion We have confirmed that space flight has a significant impact on murine bone marrow macrophages in vitro. We see significant increases in cell proliferation and changes in the pattern of expression of cell-surface differentiation antigens. Differences in gene expression in 1678 genes in the differentiating macrophages during space flight are consistent with this observation. Importantly, these changes do not appear to be from decreases in the surface expression of the receptor for M-CSF. We recently found that there are changes in bone marrow subpopulations in mice after they are subjected to space flight (Ortega et al., 2009). The data from STS-126 indicates that there can also be direct gravitational effects on those bone marrow cells. The long-term effects of these changes have yet to be determined and should be the focus of appropriate studies on the International Space Station.Supplementary Material 01 MS361876-supplement-01.docx (40.5KB, docx) 02 MS361876-supplement-02.docx (16.3KB, docx) Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Alison Fedrow, Dr. Lea Dib, and Mr. Alejandro Estrada for their help in setting up these experiments at Kansas State University.

Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthetase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may be important for the provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.INTRODUCTION Ehrlichia chaffeensis is the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). There were 1,429 cases of HME in 2010 and 2011 (14). This represents a significant increase in the incidence of the disease since 2003 and qualifies HME as an emerging infectious disease (25). In addition to being reported in the United States, HME has also been documented in Africa, Europe, China, and Brazil (9, 16, 42, 67). E. chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium. However, little is known about the parasitized-host requirements for bacterial replication. Drosophila melanogaster has been used to study a variety of intracellular pathogens. In particular, it has been successfully manipulated for the identification of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. These pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes (1, 2), Chlamydia trachomatis (20), Mycobacterium marinum (1, 18, 30, 48), Francisella tularensis (51, 64), and the protozoan parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum (8, 53). We previously demonstrated that E. chaffeensis is capable of infecting, completing its life cycle, and maintaining its pathogenicity in both Drosophila S2 cells (39) and adult flies (40). We have also identified growth conditions that were nonpermissive for the growth of E. chaffeensis infection in Drosophila S2 cells (39). Therefore, we hypothesized that a transcriptional microarray analysis of permissively infected and nonpermissively infected S2 cells would reveal host genes that contribute to the replication of Ehrlichia. We used the Affymetrix Drosophila 2.0 array to identify a subset of genes that were exclusively expressed during E. chaffeensis infection in infected S2 cells under permissive growth conditions. We screened adult flies carrying mutations in several of the candidate genes, 10 of which change the fly response to E. chaffeensis compared to wild-type flies. Gene products from 7 of the 10 genes identified are associated with mitochondrial function and/or location. We also describe follow-up experiments to investigate how Uck2 might function and its relevance to mammalian infections.MATERIALS AND METHODS Maintenance of cell lines and E. chaffeensis infections. The canine macrophage cell line DH82 (ATCC CRL-10389) was cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) (EMEM7). THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Drosophila S2 cells, obtained from the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), were cultivated at 25°C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For experiments, S2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. The E. chaffeensis Arkansas isolate was continuously cultivated in DH82 cells, as described previously, at 37°C, 8% CO2 in EMEM7 (40). Purified bacteria were used to reinfect DH82, THP-1, and S2 cells.Infections in permissive and nonpermissive Drosophila S2 cells. To make S2 cells nonpermissive to E. chaffeensis infection, the cells were allowed to adhere for 30 min prior to adding sonicated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 10 μg per ml. The S2 cells plus LPS were incubated for 5 h prior to infection with E. chaffeensis. The Ehrlichia-infected S2 cells were monitored at 24 and 96 h postinfection (p.i.). Additionally, uninfected S2 cells, inactivated and activated with LPS, were used as controls. S2 cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min prior to RNA isolation from cell pellets using 1 ml of TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The TriReagent-cell mixture was transferred to 2.0-ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime, Westbury, NY). Chloroform (200 μl) was added, and the mixture was gently mixed for 15 s. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the aqueous phase was poured into 1.5-ml tubes. The RNA was precipitated and washed with isopropanol and ethanol according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA pellet was suspended in 50 μl of nuclease-free water, and the RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) before and after DNA digestion using a Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX).Determination of infection by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). For the microarray, infections were confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR using the Promega Access One-Step RT-PCR kit (Madison, WI). Total RNA (750 ng) was used for each 25-μl reaction mixture, which contained the following reagents: 1× buffer, 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 2 μM forward primer, 2 μM reverse primer, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1 U/μl DNA polymerase, 1 U/μl reverse transcriptase, and nuclease-free water. RT-PCRs were performed in a thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient, Hauppauge, NY). Primers and probes were designed with Primer Quest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and data from  reference sequences (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). RT-PCR conditions for the 16S rRNA of E. chaffeensis were 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 4 min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min (21). The ribosomal protein 49 gene (rp49) was used as a housekeeping gene in RT-PCR experiments with Drosophila S2 cells. The RT-PCR conditions for rp49 gene amplification were 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 2 min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min. No-template RT-PCR controls were also included. RT-PCR product bands were identified on a ChemiImager (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA) after electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide. Flies were anesthetized using CO2 prior to homogenization with disposable pestles (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ) in 1 ml of TriReagent. The homogenates were transferred to 2.0 ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes and processed as described above for RNA isolation. Ehrlichia quantification in S2 cells and fly experiments was estimated using TaqMan-based qRT-PCR, as previously described (40, 55), using Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a as the housekeeping gene with primers described in Table S1 in the supplemental material. E. chaffeensis was detected as described previously (40, 55). The qRT-PCRs were performed in the Cepheid SmartCycler System (Sunnyvale, CA). Analysis of gene expression based on qRT-PCR results was performed using the method described by Pfaffl (47). In short, primer efficiencies were calculated from standard dilution curves plotting threshold cycle (CT) values versus log RNA using the following equation: efficiency = 10(−1/slope of standard curve). The change in CT values for both genes of interest and housekeeping controls was determined by calculating the ΔΔCT using the following equation: (efficiency of gene of interestGene of interest:ΔCT control − treated)/(efficiency of housekeeping geneHousekeeping gene:ΔCT control − treated).Microarray analysis. Microarray analysis was performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center Microarray Facility (Kansas City, KS) using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) Drosophila 2.0 Gene chips according to the manufacturer's specifications. The analysis was performed on four treatment groups (each submitted in triplicate at 24 h p.i.): (i) S2 cells infected with E. chaffeensis, (ii) S2 cells incubated with LPS and then infected with E. chaffeensis, (iii) S2 cells incubated with LPS, and (iv) untreated/uninfected S2 cells. CHP files were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.3 software and normalized by “per gene: normalize to median.” The “filter on volcano plot” was applied at 1.5-fold change and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level (α) of 0.05. Genes upregulated 1.5-fold or more above basal expression levels were identified under both permissive and nonpermissive conditions compared to uninfected controls at 24 h p.i. These gene sets were then compared, and those upregulated exclusively under either permissive or nonpermissive conditions at 24 h p.i. were identified. Microarray MIAMI-compliant data are available at the publicly accessible database (http://bioinformatics.kumc.edu/mdms/login.php) by accessing the experiment entitled “Differential Gene Expression in Ehrlichia chaffeensis-infected S2 cells.” D. melanogaster. Flies were maintained on standard dextrose-molasses-yeast medium at 18 to 29°C. For all experiments, flies with the appropriate background were used as wild-type (WT) controls. w;Hemese-Gal4 UASGFP flies (GFPHeme) (from Michael J. Williams, Umea Centre for Molecular Pathogenesis, Umea University, Umea, Sweden), yellow-white (yw) (maintained in our stock collection at Kansas State University), and/or white ocelli (wo1) (stock number 634, from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) were used as the WT in these experiments. withered (whd1) (FBgn0004012; stock number 441), dumpy (dpov1) (FBgn0053196; stock number 276), and tilt (tt1wo1) (FBgn0003868; stock number 623) mutants are all the result of spontaneous mutations (35, 44, 65) and were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. The stock numbers, genotypes, and associated genes of adult Drosophila flies screened by microinjection are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material.Adult Drosophila Infections. Flies were transferred to fresh food at least 24 h prior to injection/infection. For injection/infection, adult male and female flies were anesthetized with CO2 (for no longer than 15 min at a time). Flies were injected with approximately 50 nl of sterile PBS or with >5,000 bacteria, using pulled glass capillary needles. Injections were made in the abdomen of the fly, close to the junction of the thorax and ventral to the junction between the dorsal and ventral cuticles. Following injection, the flies were maintained in clean bottles with molasses caps that were changed every other day throughout the course of the experiments. Survival of the flies was monitored daily.CPEC treatment of S2 cells. Cyclopentenylcytosine (CPEC) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) through a Materials Transfer Agreement. The CPEC was prepared to a final concentration of 15.06 mM using sterile water containing 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Two different infection protocols were used for testing the effect of CPEC on the growth of E. chaffeensis in the S2 cells. For the first protocol, CPEC was added to S2 cells at final concentrations of 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 μM/well; E. chaffeensis was added to the treated cells 2 days later, and RNA was extracted from the cells 2 days postinfection. For the second protocol, S2 cells were infected with E. chaffeensis for 2 days, and then various concentrations of CPEC were then added and RNA extractions were performed 2 days following the CPEC treatment. S2 cells treated with diluent only and infected with Ehrlichia and uninfected S2 cells were used as controls. A qRT-PCR assay was used to analyze transcript levels of Ehrlichia 16S rRNA and Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a, as described above.Addition of exogenous cytosine to Drosophila S2 cells. Cytosine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The cytosine was dissolved in 500 mM hydrochloric acid and then in sterile water to 100 mM, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For infection experiments, S2 cells were incubated for 24 h prior to cytosine addition to a final concentration of 25 mM; the cells were further incubated for 24 h. E. chaffeensis was added to the cytosine-treated cells, to untreated S2 cells, and to S2 cells treated with the cytosine diluent. Untreated, uninfected S2 cells were used as a negative control. RNA was extracted from the cells at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h p.i. qRT-PCR was used to measure transcript levels of Ehrlichia 16S rRNA and Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a, as described above.THP-1 cell differentiation and cell cultures. THP-1 human macrophages were cultured as described above. For differentiation, THP-1 cells (6 × 104 THP-1 cells/well; 24-well plates) were incubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at a final concentration of 50 μM. The cells were cultured for 24 h to allow final differentiation into macrophages in a cell culture incubator at 37°C with 8% CO2.Measurement of transfection efficiency and UCK2 knockdown. We selected the small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection conditions based on the transfection efficiency in the cells of a fluorescently labeled transfection control siRNA duplex conjugated with the fluorescent marker TYE 563. Transiently transfected cells were analyzed for transfection efficiency using fluorescence microscopy. UCK2 transcript expression was knocked down in THP-1 cells using siRNA specific to the human UCK2 transcript. We used the TriFecta RNA interference (RNAi) kit with predesigned oligonucleotide sets from IDT. The siRNA predesigned oligonucleotide query was done using the UCK2 RNA coding sequence (CDS) from  reference sequence XM_846154.2 for Homo sapiens. We also used scrambled siRNA and human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) siRNAs as negative and positive controls, respectively, to confirm transfection and siRNA knockdown efficiency. All siRNA duplexes were dissolved in nuclease-free water (pH 7.2) to a final concentration of 2 nM. Three UCK2-specific, an HPRT-specific, and scrambled siRNA duplexes were transfected into differentiated THP-1 cells using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. THP-1 cells were infected with E. chaffeensis 48 h posttransfection. Transfected and Ehrlichia-infected THP-1 cells were analyzed for UCK2, HPRT knockdown efficiency and the level of bacterial infection by qRT-PCR 48 h postinfection using primers and probes described in Table S1 in the supplemental material, as explained above.TEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of uninfected and E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cultures was performed as described previously (17).Statistics. Data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean (SEM). Differences in means were determined using the Mann-Whitney two-tailed rank-sum statistical test, which is independent of the underlying population distribution (StatMost statistical package; Data XIOM, Los Angeles, CA). Survival data were analyzed for significance using the log rank test of Kaplan-Meier plots and Prism (La Jolla, CA) Graphpad software. P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTS Microarray “permissive-exclusive” genes after infection with E. chaffeensis. To identify host genes that are necessary for E. chaffeensis infection, we examined transcript levels of Drosophila S2 cells under four different conditions at 24 h p.i. to assess the host factors that might be needed to initiate the infection. They included (i) uninfected S2 cells, (ii) uninfected S2 cells activated with LPS, (iii) S2 cells activated with LPS and then infected with E. chaffeensis (nonpermissive conditions; this experiment, performed as in previous studies, demonstrated the inhibition of E. chaffeensis replication in LPS-activated S2 cells [43]), and (iv) S2 cells infected with E. chaffeensis (permissive conditions). E. chaffeensis replicated only under permissive conditions and not under nonpermissive conditions for as long as 96 h p.i. (Fig. 1). Uninfected cells were used to discern the basal transcript levels in the S2 cells, and comparisons across the different conditions were based on this basal level of expression. In order to understand which gene transcripts were specific to nonpermissive S2 cells, we used the S2 cells that were treated only with LPS as a comparison. Cells that received only LPS treatment revealed activation-specific gene transcripts. We compared those genes to the genes that had increased transcript levels in cells infected under nonpermissive conditions for bacterial growth to deduce transcripts that were upregulated exclusively under nonpermissive conditions. We also determined the gene transcripts that were upregulated 1.5-fold or more exclusively under permissive infection conditions for E. chaffeensis growth, and 2,128 genes were upregulated 1.5-fold more than in uninfected controls. Under nonpermissive growth conditions, 1,742 of the genes were upregulated 1.5-fold more than in uninfected S2 cells. When we compared transcripts that were upregulated under permissive growth conditions to transcripts that were upregulated under nonpermissive growth conditions, we identified 527 genes unique to permissive conditions (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Of these, 210 had previously been ascribed some function and had some characterization. The functions of the remaining 307 genes had yet to be defined and had “CG” (computed gene) gene designations. However, a number of these genes had orthologs with some described properties. These ortholog gene descriptions were used to ascribe functions for our analyses. Viable and fertile adult fly mutant stocks were available for 118 of the 527 genes (37 stocks for defined genes and 81 stocks for undefined genes). These flies had appropriate mutations in coding exons in the genes of interest and allowed testing of how the absence of a functional gene would affect fly survival and/or bacterial replication in vivo. Our screen of mutant fly lines was loosely based on descriptions of genes that controlled functions that we guessed might be important for bacterial growth or were random choices of CG-designated genes. Fig 1. Open in a new tab Infection of microarray samples by E. chaffeensis. S2 cells with and without LPS treatment were assayed for E. chaffeensis infection after 24 or 96 h; uninfected S2 cells were also assessed. E. chaffeensis infection was confirmed by assessing the 16S ribosomal RNA as described in Materials and Methods. D. melanogaster rp49 transcript was used as a loading control. E. chaffeensis infection in selected mutant Drosophila fly lines. We screened 19 Drosophila lines with mutations in the genes of interest (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) for bacterial replication and fly survival. Flies (wild type and mutant) were injected with cell-free E. chaffeensis or sterile PBS and monitored for survival for 96 to 120 h p.i. (20 flies per treatment group per experiment; the experiment was repeated independently at least 3 times). We looked for the mutants that displayed increased survival of the flies after bacterial challenge compared to the wild-type flies. Our hypothesis was that the gene affected in a mutant allowed increased survival because its expression was needed for E. chaffeensis replication. We found that the flies that had mutations in Nup37, Echs1, Cht11, CG6479, Ccdc58, Apop1, san, and Uck2 displayed significantly increased survival compared to wild-type flies after infection with E. chaffeensis (Fig. 2). In contrast, several mutants did not show increased resistance to E. chaffeensis infections. They included three G3pdh mutants (stock 1124, shown in Fig. 2) and CG14434 (Fig. 2), as well as CG10672, CG4743, CG9300, tsp3A, CG10992, and Gap69C (data not shown). Fig 2. Open in a new tab Infection of mutant flies with E. chaffeensis. D. melanogaster was mutant for the indicated genes and was observed for sensitivity to infection. Wild-type flies were injected with PBS (△) or bacteria (▲), and mutant flies were injected with PBS (○) or bacteria (●). The data represent means ± SEM of three or more independent experiments, with 20 flies per treatment group per experiment. †, survival is significantly different from that of E. chaffeensis-infected wild-type flies; P < 0.05 using the log rank test of the Kaplan-Meier plots.To confirm that Nup37, Echs1, Cht11, CG6479, Ccdc58, Apop1, san, and Uck2 gene mutations affected E. chaffeensis infections, we also estimated bacterial replication as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). Experimental infection of flies with disruptions in all 8 genes resulted in a significant drop in the numbers of bacteria compared to those observed in wild-type flies infected with the organism (Fig. 3). Fig 3. Open in a new tab Bacterial growth in Drosophila mutants. Bacterial numbers were quantified 96 h after infection using qRT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. The data represent means ± SEM of three assessments for Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, san, CG6479, tilt, withered, and dumpy and one assessment for Ccdc58, Nup37, and Apop1.Uridine/cytidine kinase mutations affect fly survival and bacterial replication. To understand the physiological relevance of disruption of gene function to E. chaffeensis growth in the host, we focused on Uck2, as an ortholog for this gene has been identified in mammalian species (43). Stroman (56) previously reported that the Drosophila dumpy, tilt, and withered stocks carried a mutation(s) that affects uridine/cytidine kinase function. To confirm the impact of Uck2 on E. chaffeensis growth, the three fly lines with putative defects in uridine/cytidine kinase function were infected with E. chaffeensis and assessed for bacterial replication. Two of these fly lines were significantly more resistant to E. chaffeensis challenge than WT flies (Fig. 4). For example, at 96 h p.i., 61% of the dumpy flies were alive compared to 42% of WT flies; similarly, 66% of withered flies survived compared to 38% of WT flies (P < 0.05). Although there was a tendency for the tilt flies (60% ± 16% survival) to be more resistant than the WT flies (46% ± 7% survival), the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 4). The increased survival of the withered and dumpy mutants was accompanied by a significant decrease in the replication of the Ehrlichia organisms, as measured by qRT-PCR assay (Fig. 3). At 96 h p.i., WT flies contained significantly more bacteria than withered and dumpy mutants (P = 0.02) (Fig. 3, bottom). The tilt mutants averaged fewer bacteria, but there was more variation in the samples. Fig 4. Open in a new tab Effects of withered (top), tilt (middle), and dumpy (bottom) gene mutations on E. chaffeensis infections. withered, tilt, and dumpy flies were screened for their sensitivity to infection. The data represent means ± SEM of 4 or 5 independent experiments, with 20 flies per treatment group per experiment. #, survival is significantly different from that of E. chaffeensis-infected wild-type flies; P < 0.05 using the log rank test of the Kaplan-Meier plots.CPEC treatment increases E. chaffeensis infection. The uridine/cytidine kinase enzyme functions in pyrimidine synthesis pathways and is specifically involved in the conversion of uridine to UMP and cytidine to CMP (52, 62, 63) (Fig. 5). dCTP can also be synthesized from glutamine through the de novo synthesis pathway, as well (52, 62) (Fig. 5). To determine the importance of the de novo synthesis pathway to E. chaffeensis infections, we obtained the drug cyclopentenyl cytosine, which inhibits the conversion of [3H]UTP to [3H]CTP (28), as an inhibitor of CTP synthetase (45, 52, 62). The drug effectively inhibits de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, leaving only the salvage pathway, with cytidine as the substrate for pyrimidine synthesis. To explore the impact of CPEC on E. chaffeensis growth, S2 cells were treated with CPEC for 48 h at a final concentration of 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μM. Subsequently, we infected those cells with E. chaffeensis for an additional 48 h. We found a significant increase in bacterial growth in all of the treated cells compared to infected cells treated with carrier only (Fig. 6, solid bars; P < 0.01). Similarly, when S2 cells were first infected with E. chaffeensis for 48 h and then treated with different concentrations of CPEC for 48 h, we observed significant increases in bacterial growth in cells treated with 10 and 100 μM CPEC compared to infected cells treated with carrier only (Fig. 6, cross-hatched bars; P < 0.01). Therefore, the de novo synthesis pathway was not needed for bacterial growth in the S2 cells and usually enhanced infection. Fig 5.

Percent change in E. chaffeensis 16S rRNA copies in S2 cells treated with CPEC compared to S2 cells treated with carrier only. There were two treatment schemes. (i) Day 1, CPEC. S2 cells were first treated with CPEC (at the indicated concentrations) for 48 h and then infected with E. chaffeensis for an additional 48 h (solid bars). (ii) Day 1, E. chaffeensis. S2 cells were first infected with E. chaffeensis for 48 h and then treated with CPEC (at the indicated concentrations) for 48 h (cross-hatched bars). RNA extraction was performed following both treatment schemes. The data presented represent the means ± SEM of 3 independent experiments.Cytosine treatment increases E. chaffeensis infection. Cytosine combines with ribose to form cytidine in the nucleotide salvage pathway. Therefore, to determine if it is an important substrate for bacterial growth, we supplemented S2 cell culture medium for 24 h with 25 mM cytosine prior to infection with E. chaffeensis, and bacterial replication was assessed at up to 96 h p.i. (Fig. 7). The cytosine-treated infected cells contained averages of 456%, 1423%, 3,352%, and 2,465% more copies of Ehrlichia 16S rRNA at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h p.i., respectively, than mock-infected cells.

The data presented represent the means of 3 independent experiments. †, significant difference (P < 0.03). Ehrlichia only represents the baseline control, which was the same at each time, so only one control is presented.Silencing of UCK2 in human THP-1 cells. The uridine-cytidine kinase UCK2 is a conserved enzyme that is present in humans, as well as D. melanogaster. Therefore, to examine the contribution of the enzyme to E. chaffeensis growth in human cells, we used double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce UCK2 gene-specific silencing to inhibit translation of UCK2. We used three different RNA duplex sequences to define the specificity of the UCK2 knockdown. THP-1 cells are a promyelocytic cell line that was induced to differentiate into macrophages for 24 h using phorbol ester. After being silenced for 48 h, cells were infected with E. chaffeensis. Three different siRNA duplexes targeted to the UCK2 transcript consistently inhibited E. chaffeensis growth by 48 h p.i. in the range of 47 to 69% compared to cells treated with a scrambled control siRNA (Table 1). We also detected improved E. chaffeensis growth in cells treated with siRNA for HPRT, which was used as a control for silencing-procedure effectiveness and to help show the specificity of the UCK2-specific duplexes.

Mitochondria surround morulae in E. chaffeensis-infected cells (49). Indeed, when we examined DH82 cells after infection with E. chaffeensis by TEM, one prominent feature of the infected cells was the clustering of large numbers of mitochondria around the morulae (Fig. 8A and B). It even appears that mitochondria were closely apposed to bacteria within the parasitophorous vacuole (Fig. 8B). This contrasts with the random distribution of mitochondria in uninfected cells (Fig. 8C). Fig 8. Open in a new tab Localization of mitochondria around morulae of E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cells.

Morulae (M) are surrounded by mitochondria, indicated by arrows.DISCUSSION We used D. melanogaster to investigate host factors that are important for the replication of E. chaffeensis. We combined microarray analysis and mutant fly screening to successfully identify 10 genes that contribute to the replication of E. chaffeensis in vivo. Seven genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) encode proteins that have mitochondrial functions, serve as substrates in the mitochondria, or are associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. For example, the Cht11 gene encodes a glycoside hydrolase with a chitinase active site (43). Cht11 is orthologous to the Chitinase 11 gene of Tribolium castaneum, which has been assigned to a separate classification group (group VII) from other identified chitinases (3) (Subbaratnam Muthukrishnan, Kansas State University, personal communication). This suggests that Cht11 has a function other than those classically described for chitinases. A two-hybrid screen associated the protein with the protein product encoded by Tiny tim 50 (22). Ttm50 (also known as Tim50) encodes a protein that is part of a transporter located on the inner mitochondrial membrane (15) (Fig. 9). Chitins and their derivatives regulate cholesterol when used as diet supplements (29, 74). Mice with high blood cholesterol had more severe Anaplasma phagocytophilum (another tick-transmitted rickettsia pathogen closely related to E. chaffeensis) infections in their blood, livers, and spleens than mice with normal cholesterol levels (72). E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum cannot synthesize cholesterol, and they scavenge it from host cells during infections (34). Therefore, Cht11 may function to regulate cholesterol levels to facilitate infections. Cholesterol can also affect both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and affect ATPase activity (10, 19). A human homolog of Cht11 has not been identified, but homologs have been identified in ticks and body lice (43). Both of these species serve as vectors for several different rickettsia bacteria (4), and it will be interesting to explore the function of the gene for the survival of E. chaffeensis and other rickettsial agents in their respective arthropod hosts. Fig 9. Open in a new tab Identification of mitochondrion-associated genes that impact E. chaffeensis infection. san [N-(alpha) acetyltransferase 50] and Uck2 (uridine/cytidine kinase) are needed for the synthesis of cardiolipin. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a product of san activity, and CTP, which is produced from CMP, a product of Uck2, are both necessary substrates for biosynthesis of cardiolipin, the major inner mitochondrial membrane lipid. Cht11 (chitinase 11) encodes part of a protein transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane. whd (withered) encodes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and Echs1 encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase; both enzymes are needed for the production of acetyl-CoA. Ccdc58 encodes coiled-coil domain-containing protein 58, which is found in complex with the inner mitochondrial membrane molecules MRPS28 and SSBP1. Apopt1 (Apoptogenic 1) induces the release of cytochrome c through the permeability transition pore and triggers apoptosis. Nup37 (Nucleoporin 37) is not found in the mitochondrion but is part of a nucleopore complex that transports hexose molecules, including glucose, an important molecule in energy metabolism.Several of the genes that impact E. chaffeensis infections encode key mitochondrial enzymes needed for fatty acid metabolism and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) production. The whd gene was originally associated with uridine kinase (56). However, recent annotation (43) and experimentation (58) have identified whd as the palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) gene. Palmitoyltransferase 1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for palmitoyl-CoA uptake into mitochondria (24) (Fig. 9). Echs1 in Drosophila is an ortholog of the ECHS1 gene in humans and other mammals (43), which encodes an enoyl-CoA hydratase in the second step of the β-oxidation pathway in the mitochondrion (27) (Fig. 9). Therefore, when we experimentally challenged flies mutant for the Echs1 gene, the immediate downstream effect was on the supply of acetyl-CoA to the citric acid cycle, which implies that the supply of acetyl-CoA may be critical to E. chaffeensis replication. san is an ortholog of the human NAA50 gene, which encodes N(alpha)-acetyltransferase 50 (43). These acetyltransferases are involved in the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate to phosphatidic acid (13). This biochemical step is upstream of the CDP diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) intermediate in the synthesis of cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is also possible that the acetyltransferase could be active in the β-oxidation pathway. However, this has yet to be proven experimentally. CG15881, or Ccdc58, is an ortholog of the human gene known as coiled-coil domain-containing protein 58 (CCDC58). Although the exact function of Ccdc58 is not known, its structure likely allows it to interact with other coiled-coil molecules (41). Indeed, the STRING association tool (60) shows that CCDC58 has a direct relationship with mitochondrial ribosomal protein S28 (MRPS28) and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 9 homolog (TIMM9), which encode an inner mitochondrial membrane chaperone protein, SSBP1, a protein putatively thought to be involved in mitochondrial DNA replication (60). The BioGraph gene association tool (33) assigned a rank of 23 out of 18,180 gene concepts (top 0.13%) when it was assigned to “mitochondria.” Other coiled-coil domain-containing proteins have been associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (70), and CCDC58 has also been associated with the mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphisms that impact the progression of AIDS (26). Therefore, it is highly likely that the impact of disruption of Ccdc58 on E. chaffeensis growth is due to its impact on mitochondrial function. CG14806 or Apopt1 has no known function in Drosophila. It is an ortholog of the Apoptogenic 1 gene (APOPT1 or Apop1) in humans and rodents (66). It is involved in the release of cytochrome c through permeability transition pores in the outer membrane of the mitochondrion and the activation of apoptosis (59, 73) (Fig. 9). It seems plausible that inhibiting apoptosis would be to the bacterium's advantage. There is increased transcription of some apoptotic genes during Ehrlichia infections (75), and there is delayed apoptosis in neutrophils after infection with Ehrlichia ewingii (71). It is possible that Apop1 is needed to help in the release of bacteria at the end of the replicative phase. E. chaffeensis organisms disseminate by lysing host cells or by exocytosis in order to spread to uninfected cells (17). More empirical analyses will be needed to support this hypothesis. Uck2 (CG6364) is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene with the molecular function of a uridine kinase (43). Functionally, it has been associated with the phagocytosis of Candida albicans (57). Using the STRING association tool (60), we found that its predicted functional partners are all involved in nucleotide/nucleoside modification. These functions include nucleoside di- and triphosphate activity (CG5276), hydrolase activity (CG8891), uracil phosphoribosyl transferase activity (CG5537), uridine phosphorylase (CG3788, CG8349), cytidylate/uridylate kinase activity (Dak1), uridine phosphorylase (CG6330), and cytidine deaminase activity (CG8349). The BioGraph gene association tool (33) assigned a rank of 12.63% (2,297th out of 18,180 gene objects) when Uck2 was associated with mitochondria, indicating a highly probable association. Cytosine triphosphate, a downstream product of the uridine kinase (38, 62), is a substrate used for the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-DAG (31, 46) (Fig. 9). CDP-DAG is synthesized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is necessary for the synthesis of cardiolipin, a major component of the inner mitochondrial membrane (46). Therefore, we reason that the uridine kinase must be essential to providing substrates for E. chaffeensis, because it cannot be provided by the de novo synthesis pathway. When we grew E. chaffeensis in the presence of CPEC, a CTP synthetase inhibitor (52, 62) that inhibits the synthesis of CTP from glutamate (Fig. 5), bacterial replication was significantly enhanced (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the bacterium does not require the host to use glutamine as a substrate during replication. Supplementation of cytosine in cells enhanced Ehrlichia replication, which further implicates the use of the salvage pathway through cytidine. The enhanced growth of another rickettsia, Rickettsia felis, from pyrimidines in tryptose phosphate broth is also consistent with the involvement of mitochondrial enzymes in obligate intracellular bacterial growth (50). Moreover, cytidine is the least abundant nucleoside in cells (32). The depletion of cytidine pools can disrupt the balance of ribonucleotides in cells, leading to alterations in cellular homeostasis and apoptosis (52). These observations suggest that E. chaffeensis needs to regulate cytidine in order to control apoptosis until its replication is completed within a phagosome. The enhanced growth of E. chaffeensis after treatment with CPEC instead of an inhibitory effect suggests that the bacterium requires the uridine/cytidine salvage pathway to phosphorylate cytidine and uridine (61) for its replication. More importantly, the disruption of E. chaffeensis growth in UCK2-silenced THP-1 macrophages reinforces the fact that the UCK2 target has human relevance. Therefore, we focused our attention on Uck2 because it has the potential to be a target for chemotherapy. UCK2 has been found to be more active in certain types of cancers (54) and acts to phosphorylate nucleoside analog drugs used for treatment of cancers and hepatitis C virus infections (23, 61). Uninfected host cells may be unaffected by UCK2 inhibitors, since nucleotides could be synthesized by the de novo synthesis pathway. The clustering of mitochondria adjacent to morulae in E. chaffeensis-infected macrophages supports the hypothesis that it has physiological relevance and is consistent with previous observations (37, 49). Mitochondrial membrane permeability and membrane potential were not disrupted by either E. chaffeensis (37) or E. ewengii (71) infection. However, Liu et al. found that mitochondrial biochemical activity was reduced, as evidenced from the measurement of mitochondrial DNA synthesis or the transcription of several mitochondrial genes (37). There is also evidence that the E. chaffeensis type IV secretion system is used to insert bacterial effector proteins into host mitochondria (36). These observations suggest that the organism inhibits mitochondrial activity, perhaps to inhibit the generation of mitochondrially produced oxidative products that would be harmful to the bacteria (5, 68). In contrast, we have disrupted several genes that are associated with mitochondrial function that negatively affect E. chaffeensis infections. The gene products of san and Uck2 affect cardiolipin synthesis on the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 9). Cht11 encodes protein for part of a transport molecule on the same inner mitochondrial membrane. The gene products of whd and Echs1 affect steroidogenesis, ketogenesis, and the Krebs cycle (Fig. 9), the last of which has clear mitochondrial dependence. Although Ccdc58 and Apopt1 are associated with mitochondria (Fig. 9), we have yet to fully understand their significance. It is also interesting that genes like Nup37 and dumpy, which do not have direct mitochondrial connections, also affect E. chaffeensis infections. The NUP37 gene product is part of nucleopores. One of the molecules it transports, glucose, is also important for mitochondrial functions. The dumpy gene has been characterized genetically and appears to impact wing and other body part development (11, 12). It has no known mammalian orthologs (43), and dumpy encodes a large extracellular molecule needed for structural integrity in wing epithelial tissue (12, 69). Interestingly, one of the properties listed for dumpy is that it binds iron and sulfur (43), properties of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidation-reduction reactions (6). Clearly, more work is necessary to understand these molecules and their host-bacterium interactions. Nevertheless, our findings provide clues about the mitochondrial processes that are needed by the bacteria. Interestingly, at least one alphaproteobacterium closely related to Ehrlichia, designated IricES1, infects the mitochondria of ovarian cells of Ixodes ricinus (7). Perhaps E. chaffeensis is one step away from a similar symbiotic relationship.Supplementary Material Supplemental material supp_80_10_3576__index.html (1.5KB, html) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Rishi Drolia, Taylor Kinney, and Rachel Nichols for their help in the laboratory with the flies, screening, and bacteria.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals. Keywords: Hemocytes, RNAi, Host-bacteria interactions, Intracellular bacteria",
    "introduction": "Introduction Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is primarily vectored by Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) (Anderson et al., 1993) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks (Parola et al., 2005). A. americanum has a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal (Parola et al., 2005). The major natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis in the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Dawson et al., 1994; Lockhart et al., 1997). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog (Yu et al., 2008), domestic goat (Dugan et al., 2000), white-footed mouse (Magnarelli et al., 1997), red fox (Davidson et al., 1999), raccoon (Dugan et al., 2005), and coyote (Kocan et al., 2000). Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate (Sotomayor et al., 2001). Although it is clear that ticks can transmit Ehrlichia organisms to vertebrate hosts (Ewing et al., 1995; Varela-Stokes, 2007), and Ehrlichia bacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically (Smith et al., 1976) and by PCR (Karim et al., 2012), it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed (Pagel Van Zee et al., 2007), the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster. In adult D. melanogaster, hemocytes contribute to host immune defenses against E. chaffeensis (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance (Chapes and Ganta, 2008; Ganta et al., 2002) even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered that D. melanogaster genes, separation anxiety (san) and Uridine cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2), are required for E. chaffeensis infections in flies (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage of Drosophila UAS-GAL4 RNAi system (Dietzl et al., 2007) that allowed for tissue-specific silencing of san and Uck2 to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, in Drosophila the bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression of Uck2 or san) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication.",

    "results": "Results Uck2 and san are required for in vivo E. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster E. chaffeensis is capable of infecting and completing its life cycle in Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008, 2009). Recent work by our group found that several host genes control the replication of Ehrlichia in vivo(Von Ohlen et al., 2012). We found that flies carrying mutations in coding regions of these genes were poorly infected by E. chaffeensis. In particular, 2 genes that are relevant to humans and ticks were chosen for this study, Uck2 and san. Uck2 functions as a uridine-cytidine kinase and is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene (McQuilton et al., 2012) and the Ixodes scapularis SCW003812 gene (Lawson et al., 2009). san is the ortholog to the human NAA50 gene and encodes the N(α)-acetyltransferase 50 protein. It is orthologous to the I. scapularis SCW002560 gene (Lawson et al., 2009). In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages (Paddock and Childs, 2003; Sotomayor et al., 2001). However, no clear requirements for cell or tissue tropism have been defined in ticks or other arthropods. To investigate where E. chaffeensis replicates in arthropods, we employed whole-organism in vivo RNAi in D. melanogaster to do tissue-specific inactivation of Uck2 and san using a fly collection that consists of expressed RNAi transgenes where the inverted repeats produce a dsRNA hairpin that produces the RNAi effect. These tools allowed us to silence Uck2 and san genes in a tissue-specific manner through the binary GAL4-UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Dietzl et al., 2007) to determine what tissues must be permissive (via their expression of Uck2 or san) for E. chaffeensis replication. To determine whether Uck2 and san could be efficiently silenced using the UAS-GAL4 system, we individually crossed transgenic flies carrying inverted repeats of the Uck2 and san genes under the control of UAS to flies carrying armadillo (arm)-GAL4 (ubiquitous GAL4 insertions) to silence Uck2 or san in the F1 progeny. We consistently averaged 78% or better transcript reduction of Uck2 or san in the RNAi flies in comparison to wild-type flies and parental lines using qRT-PCR (Table 1). When wild-type flies, parental line flies, and Uck2- and san-RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis in the abdomen, we observed that there was approximately 48% death in wild-type and parental lines after 96 h. This rate of death was significantly increased compared to control flies injected with PBS or flies which had ubiquitous tissue expression of Uck2-or san-RNAi (Fig. 1A and 1B) (P<0.05, log rank test). When we assessed the effect of infection on RNAi flies where Uck2 or san were knocked down ubiquitously, we detected significantly fewer bacteria at 96 hpi (P<0.05, t-test) compared to wild-type or parental fly controls (Fig. 2A and 2B). These experiments confirmed that the UAS-GAL4 technique could be used to efficiently silence Uck2 and san in adult flies and that E. chaffeensis infection in flies was dependent on functional Uck2 and san genes.

E. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster Ubiquitous tissue silencing of Uck2 and san impaired E. chaffeensis infection in adult D. melanogaster. Therefore, we screened an array of tissues to determine if Uck2 or san expression were necessary in those tissues for bacterial replication. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages (Paddock and Childs, 2003). Therefore, we hypothesized that E. chaffeensis replicates in hemocytes, the insect equivalent to mammalian macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we silenced Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, hemocytes, fat body, and salivary glands in a tissue-specific manner in adult flies. We used eye-specific (Gmr-GAL4), wing-specific (MS1096-GAL4), hemocyte-specific (Hml-GAL4), fat body-specific (YP1-Gal), or salivary gland-specific (Fhk-GAL4) GAL4 fly lines to generate F1 flies. To confirm the tissue-specific knockdown of targeted genes, we dissected whole heads and wings from adult flies to assess eye-specific and wing-specific adult knockdown. We observed an average ≥74% reduction in transcript levels of Uck2 and san in whole heads or wings of F1 transgenic flies using eye- or wing-specific GAL4 constructs (Table 2). In comparison, the average knockdown of Uck2 or san in the whole body minus the respective eyes or wings never averaged >15% knockdown (Table 2). These data confirmed the tissue-specific targeting of both Uck2 and san genes. Table 2. Determination of off-target silencing in wings, eyes, and bodya,b.

Negative numbers indicate higher transcript levels. cNumbers presented represent the mean ± SD of one or 3 independent experiments. dNumbers presented represent the mean ± SD of yw and parental lines 1 and 2 (columns 4–6). We used whole adult flies to assess hemocyte-specific knockdown using the hemocyte-specific GAL4 line to express Uck2 and san-RNAi transgenes specifically in hemocytes. We found that RNA levels were reduced by an average of 79±6% and 62±4%, respectively, when compared to experimental controls (Table 1). Because the Hml-Gal4 line is highly specific for expression in the hemocytes, we can reasonably assume that the reduction in RNA levels in these whole flies is due to specific knockdown of the transcript in hemocytes and not other tissues (Dietzl et al., 2007). The fat body and salivary glands are difficult to dissect from adult flies. Since the RNAi effect is applicable at all stages of the Drosophila lifespan (Dietzl et al., 2007), we isolated the fat bodies and salivary glands from 3rd instar larvae to assess the silencing efficiency specifically in the fat body and salivary glands of our RNAi flies. In the dissected fat body from fat body-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi third instar larvae, there was an average of 77±8% and 66±12% reduction in transcript levels, respectively, compared to dissected fat body from 3rd instar control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 1). Similarly, transcript levels in dissected salivary glands from salivary gland-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi 3rd instar larvae showed that RNA levels were reduced >90% in comparison to dissected salivary glands from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2). In contrast, there was <29% knockdown of san or Uck2 in RNA samples extracted from non-salivary gland tissue isolated from 3rd instar larvae in comparison to non-salivary gland tissue from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2). After confirming tissue-specific RNAi silencing effect of Uck2 and san, control and RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis. We observed that eye- (Fig. 3A and 3B), salivary gland- (Fig. 3C and 3D), and wing- (Fig. 3E and 3F) specific knockdown of Uck2 and san did not impact fly survival. These RNAi flies were as susceptible to E. chaffeensis infection as wild-type and parental controls (Fig. 3; P>0.05, log-rank tests). In contrast, hemocyte- and fat body-specific Uck2- (Fig. 4A and 4C)and san- (Fig. 4B and 4D) RNAi flies survived significantly better (P<0.05, log-rank test) than the control flies after infection with Ehrlichia (Fig. 4A–D). Ninety-six hours after infection, >80% of hemocyte-specific Uck2-RNAi and San-RNAi flies survived in comparison to an average of 50% of wild-type and parental control flies. When we assessed F1 RNAi flies for bacteria load, there were no differences in bacteria number in eye-specific (Fig. 5A and 5B), salivary gland-specific (Fig. 5C and 5D), and wing-specific (Fig. 5E and 5F) Uck2 and san F1 RNAi flies compared to control flies (P>0.05, t-test). However, F1 RNAi flies with hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) knockdown of Uck2 or san had significantly fewer bacteria (P<0.05, t-test). At the 96-h time point, there were greater than 95% fewer bacteria in hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) Uck2- or san-RNAi flies, respectively, compared to controls.

    "discussion": "Discussion E. chaffeensis is transmitted from ticks to vertebrate hosts when the tick takes a blood meal (Paddock and Childs, 2003). One remaining question is where do the bacteria replicate in the tick? Because the genetic tools in ticks have not been developed to the same extent as they have in Drosophila, we addressed a more general question about where the bacteria replicate in dipteran arthropods. Indeed, this study provides insights about E. chaffeensis replication in arthropods. Our data confirm that Uck2 and san are needed for E. chaffeensis replication (Von Ohlen et al., 2012) and support the hypothesis that the bacteria replicate in the hemocytes or the fat body in adult D. melanogaster. Infection was poorer in flies that had hemocyte- or fat body-specific knockdown of Uck2 or san. We concede that fruit flies and ticks have different life cycles, feeding habits, and environments, and this may not allow extrapolation of the results to the tick system. Nevertheless, this is a valuable study because it identifies sites where the bacteria replicate in a model arthropod system using experimental methods which would not have been possible in the tick system. We demonstrated that E. chaffeensis replicated when Uck2 and san were expressed in hemocytes and the fat body, but not when these genes were silenced in those tissues. Silencing of Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands of adult D. melanogaster did not affect infection. Because of the tissue-specific knockdown of the genes in these tissues (Dietzl et al., 2007), the data suggest that bacterial replication occurs predominantly in the hemocytes and the fat body. These data are consistent with the vertebrate tropism for macrophages and monocytes (Paddock and Childs, 2003; Sotomayor et al., 2001). Hemocytes are the arthropod host equivalent of macrophages (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). The fat body is functionally equivalent to mammalian liver (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). These data are also consistent with the previous observation that Rickettsia rickettsii invade hemocytes in ixodid ticks (Socolovschi et al., 2009). Previously, our group found that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in hemocyte-like phagocytic S2 cells (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008). S2 cells have hemocyte-like properties and express a variety of hemocyte markers such as Hemolectin (Hml) (Charroux and Royet, 2009), Hemese (He) (Lebestky et al., 2000), Drosophila scavenger receptor-CI (dSR-CI) (Pearson et al., 1995), and croquemort, a member of the CD36 superfamily (Franc et al., 1999). However, because these cells have combined properties of plasmatocytes and crystal cells, we could not conclude that they are hemocytes (Cherbas et al., 2011). We also found that E. chaffeensis labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo fluoresced red after injection into adult flies, presumably because they were in the low pH environment of the hemocytes (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Therefore, these new in vivo data add to the growing evidence that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in the hemocytes of adult D. melanogaster. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the behavior of other intracellular pathogens which are capable of avoiding the phagocytic pathway and replicate within Drosophila hemocytes. These pathogens include Salmonella typhimurium (Brandt et al., 2004), Listeria monocytogenes (Mansfield et al., 2003), Mycobacterium marinum (Dionne et al., 2003), Legionella pneumophila (Dorer et al., 2006), and Francisella tularensis (Vonkavaara et al., 2008). The expression of Uck2 or san in the salivary glands of adult D. melanogaster was not necessary for E. chaffeensis infection. These findings were intriguing since A. phagocytophilum, a bacterium closely related to E. chaffeensis, and E. chaffeensis have been detected in the salivary glands of experimentally infected ticks (Karim et al., 2012; Rikihisa, 2011). In our experiments, Drosophila were infected by needle injection in the abdomen; not the natural route of infection in a tick. Ticks acquire the infection from a vertebrate host during their blood meal (Paddock and Childs, 2003). Thus, the dissemination of E. chaffeensis to assorted tissues may vary due to differences in route of infection. Interestingly, in ticks, needle injection does result in bacteria in the salivary glands (Karim et al., 2012). However, it is possible that salivary gland and host physiology may vary among arthropods depending on the life cycle. In nature, Drosophila live on yeast growing on decaying fruit and food. This could suggest that their salivary glands are better adapted to fight potential pathogenic microorganisms and extrapolation of the data from Drosophila to ticks needs to be done cautiously. We observed 97% fewer bacteria 96 h post infection in fat body-specific Uck2 or san- F1 RNAi flies compared to wild-type and parental controls. Because there is tissue-specific knockdown in the fat body, some residual bacterial replication should occur in the hemocytes of the flies. Indeed, this might have been the case. In general, when one looks at the bacteria growth kinetics in tissues that are not affected by Uck2 or san knockdown (eyes, wings, salivary glands), bacterial numbers generally increase over time after infection (Fig. 5). In contrast, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced in hemocytes, bacteria failed to grow (Fig. 6A and 6B). However, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced specifically in the fat body, the bacteria growth kinetics showed an initial increase in bacterial numbers for 24 h that paralleled the growth of the bacteria in the parental (non-RNAi control) fly lines (Fig. 6A and 6B). Subsequently, the bacterial numbers were reduced (Fig. 6C and 6D). These data suggest that the bacteria were replicating during the early part of the infection in the hemocytes, but because the bacteria were not replicating in the fat body, the activation of the fly immune system was able to respond more effectively against E. chaffeensis than when the bacteria replicate in both hemocytes and the fat body. We have previously found that hemocytes in adult flies as well as toll and IMD defense pathways are actively involved in host defense against E. chaffeensis (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Alternatively, the failure of bacteria to thrive even in the presence of functional Uck2 and san genes in hemocytes might be because there is coordination between the hemocytes and the fat body. Several observations indicate that hemocytes can signal to the fat body to regulate the humoral immune response (Agaisse et al., 2003; Brennan et al., 2007; Dijkers and O’Farrell, 2007; Shia et al., 2009). Thus, signaling between the hemocytes and other immunocompetent tissue such as the fat body may play a critical role in coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to ensure efficient defense of the organism. Our results suggest that the tissue tropism of E. chaffeensis for phagocytic cells arose approximately 600 million years ago, since that is when mammals and dipterans last shared a common ancestor (Gordon and Waterhouse, 2007; Pesole et al., 1991). Ticks and dipterans last shared a common ancestor approximately 500 million years ago (Ullmann et al., 2005). Therefore, one would expect the tropism for hemocytes to be similar in ticks. However, genetic drift could have occurred in the Ecdysozoa, Arthropoda, or later in the Chelicerata (Gordon and Waterhouse, 2007). There is 59.5% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis Uck2 gene products and 83.6% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis san gene products (Lawson et al., 2009). Therefore, it is not clear, whether this tropism will also be seen in A. americanum, the vector of E. chaffeensis. Additional experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In conclusion, we have used UAS-GAL4 RNAi system in D. melanogaster to show that functional Uck2 and san genes are required for in vivo E. chaffeensis replication. Moreover, we have successfully identified intracellular niches where E. chaffeensis replicates in dipteran arthopods; the hemocytes and fat body of adult D. melanogaster. We hope that understanding the tissue targets of E. chaffeensis in arthropods will help in drug design and RNAi therapeutics for HME and other tick- and arthropod-borne diseases.",

Copyright notice ID: 3558598 MSID: MS430600 PMID: 23306065 The publisher's version of this article is available at Int J Med Microbiol Abstract Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals. Keywords: Hemocytes, RNAi, Host-bacteria interactions, Intracellular bacteriaIntroduction Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is primarily vectored by Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) (Anderson et al., 1993) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks (Parola et al., 2005). A. americanum has a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal (Parola et al., 2005). The major natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis in the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Dawson et al., 1994; Lockhart et al., 1997). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog (Yu et al., 2008), domestic goat (Dugan et al., 2000), white-footed mouse (Magnarelli et al., 1997), red fox (Davidson et al., 1999), raccoon (Dugan et al., 2005), and coyote (Kocan et al., 2000). Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate (Sotomayor et al., 2001). Although it is clear that ticks can transmit Ehrlichia organisms to vertebrate hosts (Ewing et al., 1995; Varela-Stokes, 2007), and Ehrlichia bacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically (Smith et al., 1976) and by PCR (Karim et al., 2012), it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed (Pagel Van Zee et al., 2007), the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster. In adult D. melanogaster, hemocytes contribute to host immune defenses against E. chaffeensis (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance (Chapes and Ganta, 2008; Ganta et al., 2002) even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered that D. melanogaster genes, separation anxiety (san) and Uridine cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2), are required for E. chaffeensis infections in flies (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage of Drosophila UAS-GAL4 RNAi system (Dietzl et al., 2007) that allowed for tissue-specific silencing of san and Uck2 to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, in Drosophila the bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression of Uck2 or san) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication.Materials and methods Cell lines and E. chaffeensis infections E. chaffeensis (Arkansas isolate) was propagated in DH82 cells (American Type Culture collection, #CRL-10389, Rockville, Md.). The DH82 cells were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 3.5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 3.5% NuSerum (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Glutamine plus (2 mM, Atlanta Biologicals) (EMEM7). Cells were grown at 37°C in an 8% CO2/92% air atmosphere. The level of infection was determined by examining cyto-centrifuged cells stained with Dif-Quik stain (Fisher Scientific Company, Kalamazoo, MI). When more than 80% of cells were infected, the cells were removed with a cell scraper and frozen at −80°C in cryogenic vials. Bacteria numbers were quantified using a TaqMan-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay as described below. Purification of host cell-free bacteria was carried out as follows. Cells were scraped from tissue culture dishes. The recovered infected cells were placed in a 50-ml, sterile centrifuge tube and shaken with glass beads. The preparation was centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min. The supernatant with host cell-free bacteria was transferred into a sterile tube and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with blue food dye at a ratio of 0.6 ml dye for every 1 ml of PBS to help us visualize the inoculum during fly injections. Most flies were injected with 6000 bacteria per fly, however, some early experiments were done with 1500 bacteria per fly. Although the severity of infections was different with the different inocula, the experimental trends were similar.D. melanogaster D. melanogaster flies were raised on standard dextrose/molasses/yeast medium at 18–29°C. The following fly lines were used: yellow white (yw) and arm-GAL4, Hml-GAL4, YP1-GAL4, MS1096-GAL4, Gmr-GAL4, Fhk-GAL4, UAS-Uck2RNAi (w[1118]; P{GD2761}v16719)and UAS-sanRNAi (w[1118]; P{GD7580}v31742). The yw fly line was maintained at Kansas State University and used as a wild type in these experiments (Von Ohlen et al., 2009). The armadillo (arm)-Gal fly line (Sanson et al., 1996) was obtained from Joan Hooper (University of Colorado, Anchutz Medical campus, Denver, CO). The Fhk-GAL4 and YP1-GAL4 were obtained from Tony Ip (The University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). The Hml-GAL4 fly line was obtained from Michael Galko (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The MS1096 and Gmr-GAL4 fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN. UAS-dsRNA transgenic fly lines were obtained from the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) (Dietzl et al., 2007). Five to seven virgin females carrying the GAL4 promoter were crossed with 3–4 males carrying different UAS-dsRNA transgenes to generate F1 flies that had tissue-specific or ubiquitous knockdown of Uck2 or san genes.RNA extraction The TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) RNA extraction method, as was previously described by our group (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009), was used to extract RNA from flies or host cell-free bacteria. Pelleted bacteria or fly homogenates were resuspended in 1 ml of TriReagent. Preparations were transferred to 2.0 ml, Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime/Eppendorf, Westbury, New York; #2302830). Three hundred microliters (300 μl) of chloroform were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 15 s. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the aqueous phase was transferred to clean 1.5 ml tubes. Five hundred microliters (500 μl) of isopropanol were added, and RNA was precipitated at −20°C for 24 h. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, and samples were centrifuged at 7400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The 70% ethanol was decanted from the pellet, and residual ethanol was allowed to evaporate for 5 min. RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of nuclease-free water. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).Quantification of bacterial numbers for infection/injection and in infected flies RNA from host cell-free Ehrlichia was extracted as described above. A TaqMan-based, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify bacterial numbers (Sirigireddy and Ganta, 2005). A total of 500–1000 ng of RNA was used for each reaction. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Invitrogen’s One-Step Platinum qRT-PCR kit (#11732) in a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). E. chaffeensis RNA was detected using primers specific for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (Sirigireddy and Ganta, 2005) ( Accession # M73222). Custom-synthesized primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) and were used. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer, RRG3 (5′ CAATTGCTTATAACCTTTTGGTTATAAAT 3′) and reverse primer, RRG27 (5′ GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC3′). Serial 10-fold dilutions of the RNA from infected DH82 cells were used to generate standard curves plotting log number of bacteria versus the corresponding Ct value. The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 30 min, 94°C for 4 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. To quantify bacterial numbers in injected/infected flies, anesthetized flies were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ) and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent as previously described (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Bacteria numbers were estimated from RNA samples using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as described above. Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a ( Accession #NM_136772) gene was used as used as housekeeping. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer (5′ TGGACCACGAGGAGGCTAGG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ GTTGGTGCATGGTCGGTGA 3′) and Taqman probe (5′-56-FAM/TGGGAGGCAAAATTCTCGGCTTC/36-TAMsp-3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 2 min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min.Estimation of silencing efficiency To quantify the level of transcriptional silencing in RNAi flies, whole-flies or specific fly tissues were used to probe for specific transcript levels. Fly tissues were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent for RNA extraction. Transcript levels of the gene of interest in F1 flies were assessed in the following whole-flies: ubiquitous (UAS-sanRNAi X arm-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X arm-GAL4); hemocytes (UAS-sanRNAi X Hml-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X Hml-GAL4); fat body (UAS-sanRNAi X YP1-GAL4 or UAS-Uck2RNAi X YP1-GAL4). For wing-specific and eye-specific knockdown, fly heads or wings were used. For fat body-specific and salivary gland-specific knockdown, fat body or salivary glands dissected from wandering third-instar larvae were used. RNA from homogenates was extracted as described above. Transcript levels were determined in RNA samples using qRT-PCR using the Invitrogen’s Superscript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit in. Primers were obtained from IDT. Drosophila ribosomal protein 15a was used as used as the housekeeping gene. Drosophila Uck2 ( Accession #NM_142984) was detected using forward primer (5′ TGTCCATCAGTCAGGACAGC 3′) and reverse primer (5′ CTCCACTTTGTGGCCCTTTA 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min. The Drosophila san gene ( Accession # NM_080040) was detected using forward primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min. To calculate knockdown efficiency serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA and corresponding Ct values were used to plot standard curves (mean of 3 experiments). Primer efficiency was calculated using the following equation (Pfaffl, 2001): Efficiency=10(-1/slopeofstandardcurve). Primer efficiency values were used to calculate the relative change in gene expression by the following equation (Pfaffl, 2001): (EfficiencyofgeneinterestGeneinterest:ΔCtcontrol-treated)(EfficiencyofhousekeepinggeneHousekeepinggene:ΔCtcontrol-treated) Parental lines (UAS and GAL4 constructs) and yw flies served as normal controls and were set at 100% expression for the gene of interest. Relative level of gene expression in RNAi flies as compared to controls was calculated to estimate the knockdown efficiency.Infections Adult flies were used to assess the effect of gene knockdown on E. chaffeensis infections. Male and female flies were anesthetized on a CO2 anesthesia pad (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA; model# 59-119). Flies were injected in the thorax with 51 nl of sterile PBS-blue food dye solution or Ehrlichia resuspended in PBS-blue food dye solution. Injections were made in the abdomen of the fly with pulled glass capillary needles using a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA). Following injection, flies were maintained in clean bottles with molasses/yeast caps. Survival was monitored daily for 4 days. Twenty flies were injected per treatment group per experiment with 3–4 independent experiments for survival data. Four to five flies were used to determine bacterial infection.Statistics Survival data were analyzed for significance using the log-rank test of Kaplan Meier plots using Prism Graphpad software (La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments unless otherwise stated. P values of <0.05 were considered highly significant. Bacterial numbers were analyzed by Student’s t test (two-tailed, general) by using the StatMost Statistical Package (Data XIOM, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Unless indicated, data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments.Results Uck2 and san are required for in vivo E. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster E. chaffeensis is capable of infecting and completing its life cycle in Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008, 2009). Recent work by our group found that several host genes control the replication of Ehrlichia in vivo(Von Ohlen et al., 2012). We found that flies carrying mutations in coding regions of these genes were poorly infected by E. chaffeensis. In particular, 2 genes that are relevant to humans and ticks were chosen for this study, Uck2 and san. Uck2 functions as a uridine-cytidine kinase and is orthologous to the mammalian UCK2 gene (McQuilton et al., 2012) and the Ixodes scapularis SCW003812 gene (Lawson et al., 2009). san is the ortholog to the human NAA50 gene and encodes the N(α)-acetyltransferase 50 protein. It is orthologous to the I. scapularis SCW002560 gene (Lawson et al., 2009). In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages (Paddock and Childs, 2003; Sotomayor et al., 2001). However, no clear requirements for cell or tissue tropism have been defined in ticks or other arthropods. To investigate where E. chaffeensis replicates in arthropods, we employed whole-organism in vivo RNAi in D. melanogaster to do tissue-specific inactivation of Uck2 and san using a fly collection that consists of expressed RNAi transgenes where the inverted repeats produce a dsRNA hairpin that produces the RNAi effect. These tools allowed us to silence Uck2 and san genes in a tissue-specific manner through the binary GAL4-UAS system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993; Dietzl et al., 2007) to determine what tissues must be permissive (via their expression of Uck2 or san) for E. chaffeensis replication. To determine whether Uck2 and san could be efficiently silenced using the UAS-GAL4 system, we individually crossed transgenic flies carrying inverted repeats of the Uck2 and san genes under the control of UAS to flies carrying armadillo (arm)-GAL4 (ubiquitous GAL4 insertions) to silence Uck2 or san in the F1 progeny. We consistently averaged 78% or better transcript reduction of Uck2 or san in the RNAi flies in comparison to wild-type flies and parental lines using qRT-PCR (Table 1). When wild-type flies, parental line flies, and Uck2- and san-RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis in the abdomen, we observed that there was approximately 48% death in wild-type and parental lines after 96 h. This rate of death was significantly increased compared to control flies injected with PBS or flies which had ubiquitous tissue expression of Uck2-or san-RNAi (Fig. 1A and 1B) (P<0.05, log rank test). When we assessed the effect of infection on RNAi flies where Uck2 or san were knocked down ubiquitously, we detected significantly fewer bacteria at 96 hpi (P<0.05, t-test) compared to wild-type or parental fly controls (Fig. 2A and 2B). These experiments confirmed that the UAS-GAL4 technique could be used to efficiently silence Uck2 and san in adult flies and that E. chaffeensis infection in flies was dependent on functional Uck2 and san genes.

E. chaffeensis replication in adult D. melanogaster Ubiquitous tissue silencing of Uck2 and san impaired E. chaffeensis infection in adult D. melanogaster. Therefore, we screened an array of tissues to determine if Uck2 or san expression were necessary in those tissues for bacterial replication. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis exhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages (Paddock and Childs, 2003). Therefore, we hypothesized that E. chaffeensis replicates in hemocytes, the insect equivalent to mammalian macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we silenced Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, hemocytes, fat body, and salivary glands in a tissue-specific manner in adult flies. We used eye-specific (Gmr-GAL4), wing-specific (MS1096-GAL4), hemocyte-specific (Hml-GAL4), fat body-specific (YP1-Gal), or salivary gland-specific (Fhk-GAL4) GAL4 fly lines to generate F1 flies. To confirm the tissue-specific knockdown of targeted genes, we dissected whole heads and wings from adult flies to assess eye-specific and wing-specific adult knockdown. We observed an average ≥74% reduction in transcript levels of Uck2 and san in whole heads or wings of F1 transgenic flies using eye- or wing-specific GAL4 constructs (Table 2). In comparison, the average knockdown of Uck2 or san in the whole body minus the respective eyes or wings never averaged >15% knockdown (Table 2). These data confirmed the tissue-specific targeting of both Uck2 and san genes. Table 2. Determination of off-target silencing in wings, eyes, and bodya,b.

Negative numbers indicate higher transcript levels. cNumbers presented represent the mean ± SD of one or 3 independent experiments. dNumbers presented represent the mean ± SD of yw and parental lines 1 and 2 (columns 4–6). We used whole adult flies to assess hemocyte-specific knockdown using the hemocyte-specific GAL4 line to express Uck2 and san-RNAi transgenes specifically in hemocytes. We found that RNA levels were reduced by an average of 79±6% and 62±4%, respectively, when compared to experimental controls (Table 1). Because the Hml-Gal4 line is highly specific for expression in the hemocytes, we can reasonably assume that the reduction in RNA levels in these whole flies is due to specific knockdown of the transcript in hemocytes and not other tissues (Dietzl et al., 2007). The fat body and salivary glands are difficult to dissect from adult flies. Since the RNAi effect is applicable at all stages of the Drosophila lifespan (Dietzl et al., 2007), we isolated the fat bodies and salivary glands from 3rd instar larvae to assess the silencing efficiency specifically in the fat body and salivary glands of our RNAi flies. In the dissected fat body from fat body-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi third instar larvae, there was an average of 77±8% and 66±12% reduction in transcript levels, respectively, compared to dissected fat body from 3rd instar control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 1). Similarly, transcript levels in dissected salivary glands from salivary gland-specific Uck2 and san-RNAi 3rd instar larvae showed that RNA levels were reduced >90% in comparison to dissected salivary glands from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2). In contrast, there was <29% knockdown of san or Uck2 in RNA samples extracted from non-salivary gland tissue isolated from 3rd instar larvae in comparison to non-salivary gland tissue from control larvae from wild-type or parental flies (Table 2). After confirming tissue-specific RNAi silencing effect of Uck2 and san, control and RNAi flies were experimentally challenged with E. chaffeensis. We observed that eye- (Fig. 3A and 3B), salivary gland- (Fig. 3C and 3D), and wing- (Fig. 3E and 3F) specific knockdown of Uck2 and san did not impact fly survival. These RNAi flies were as susceptible to E. chaffeensis infection as wild-type and parental controls (Fig. 3; P>0.05, log-rank tests). In contrast, hemocyte- and fat body-specific Uck2- (Fig. 4A and 4C)and san- (Fig. 4B and 4D) RNAi flies survived significantly better (P<0.05, log-rank test) than the control flies after infection with Ehrlichia (Fig. 4A–D). Ninety-six hours after infection, >80% of hemocyte-specific Uck2-RNAi and San-RNAi flies survived in comparison to an average of 50% of wild-type and parental control flies. When we assessed F1 RNAi flies for bacteria load, there were no differences in bacteria number in eye-specific (Fig. 5A and 5B), salivary gland-specific (Fig. 5C and 5D), and wing-specific (Fig. 5E and 5F) Uck2 and san F1 RNAi flies compared to control flies (P>0.05, t-test). However, F1 RNAi flies with hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) knockdown of Uck2 or san had significantly fewer bacteria (P<0.05, t-test). At the 96-h time point, there were greater than 95% fewer bacteria in hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) Uck2- or san-RNAi flies, respectively, compared to controls.

One remaining question is where do the bacteria replicate in the tick? Because the genetic tools in ticks have not been developed to the same extent as they have in Drosophila, we addressed a more general question about where the bacteria replicate in dipteran arthropods. Indeed, this study provides insights about E. chaffeensis replication in arthropods. Our data confirm that Uck2 and san are needed for E. chaffeensis replication (Von Ohlen et al., 2012) and support the hypothesis that the bacteria replicate in the hemocytes or the fat body in adult D. melanogaster. Infection was poorer in flies that had hemocyte- or fat body-specific knockdown of Uck2 or san. We concede that fruit flies and ticks have different life cycles, feeding habits, and environments, and this may not allow extrapolation of the results to the tick system. Nevertheless, this is a valuable study because it identifies sites where the bacteria replicate in a model arthropod system using experimental methods which would not have been possible in the tick system. We demonstrated that E. chaffeensis replicated when Uck2 and san were expressed in hemocytes and the fat body, but not when these genes were silenced in those tissues. Silencing of Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands of adult D. melanogaster did not affect infection. Because of the tissue-specific knockdown of the genes in these tissues (Dietzl et al., 2007), the data suggest that bacterial replication occurs predominantly in the hemocytes and the fat body. These data are consistent with the vertebrate tropism for macrophages and monocytes (Paddock and Childs, 2003; Sotomayor et al., 2001). Hemocytes are the arthropod host equivalent of macrophages (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). The fat body is functionally equivalent to mammalian liver (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). These data are also consistent with the previous observation that Rickettsia rickettsii invade hemocytes in ixodid ticks (Socolovschi et al., 2009). Previously, our group found that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in hemocyte-like phagocytic S2 cells (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008). S2 cells have hemocyte-like properties and express a variety of hemocyte markers such as Hemolectin (Hml) (Charroux and Royet, 2009), Hemese (He) (Lebestky et al., 2000), Drosophila scavenger receptor-CI (dSR-CI) (Pearson et al., 1995), and croquemort, a member of the CD36 superfamily (Franc et al., 1999). However, because these cells have combined properties of plasmatocytes and crystal cells, we could not conclude that they are hemocytes (Cherbas et al., 2011). We also found that E. chaffeensis labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo fluoresced red after injection into adult flies, presumably because they were in the low pH environment of the hemocytes (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Therefore, these new in vivo data add to the growing evidence that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in the hemocytes of adult D. melanogaster. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the behavior of other intracellular pathogens which are capable of avoiding the phagocytic pathway and replicate within Drosophila hemocytes. These pathogens include Salmonella typhimurium (Brandt et al., 2004), Listeria monocytogenes (Mansfield et al., 2003), Mycobacterium marinum (Dionne et al., 2003), Legionella pneumophila (Dorer et al., 2006), and Francisella tularensis (Vonkavaara et al., 2008). The expression of Uck2 or san in the salivary glands of adult D. melanogaster was not necessary for E. chaffeensis infection. These findings were intriguing since A. phagocytophilum, a bacterium closely related to E. chaffeensis, and E. chaffeensis have been detected in the salivary glands of experimentally infected ticks (Karim et al., 2012; Rikihisa, 2011). In our experiments, Drosophila were infected by needle injection in the abdomen; not the natural route of infection in a tick. Ticks acquire the infection from a vertebrate host during their blood meal (Paddock and Childs, 2003). Thus, the dissemination of E. chaffeensis to assorted tissues may vary due to differences in route of infection. Interestingly, in ticks, needle injection does result in bacteria in the salivary glands (Karim et al., 2012). However, it is possible that salivary gland and host physiology may vary among arthropods depending on the life cycle. In nature, Drosophila live on yeast growing on decaying fruit and food. This could suggest that their salivary glands are better adapted to fight potential pathogenic microorganisms and extrapolation of the data from Drosophila to ticks needs to be done cautiously. We observed 97% fewer bacteria 96 h post infection in fat body-specific Uck2 or san- F1 RNAi flies compared to wild-type and parental controls. Because there is tissue-specific knockdown in the fat body, some residual bacterial replication should occur in the hemocytes of the flies. Indeed, this might have been the case. In general, when one looks at the bacteria growth kinetics in tissues that are not affected by Uck2 or san knockdown (eyes, wings, salivary glands), bacterial numbers generally increase over time after infection (Fig. 5). In contrast, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced in hemocytes, bacteria failed to grow (Fig. 6A and 6B). However, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced specifically in the fat body, the bacteria growth kinetics showed an initial increase in bacterial numbers for 24 h that paralleled the growth of the bacteria in the parental (non-RNAi control) fly lines (Fig. 6A and 6B). Subsequently, the bacterial numbers were reduced (Fig. 6C and 6D). These data suggest that the bacteria were replicating during the early part of the infection in the hemocytes, but because the bacteria were not replicating in the fat body, the activation of the fly immune system was able to respond more effectively against E. chaffeensis than when the bacteria replicate in both hemocytes and the fat body. We have previously found that hemocytes in adult flies as well as toll and IMD defense pathways are actively involved in host defense against E. chaffeensis (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Alternatively, the failure of bacteria to thrive even in the presence of functional Uck2 and san genes in hemocytes might be because there is coordination between the hemocytes and the fat body. Several observations indicate that hemocytes can signal to the fat body to regulate the humoral immune response (Agaisse et al., 2003; Brennan et al., 2007; Dijkers and O’Farrell, 2007; Shia et al., 2009). Thus, signaling between the hemocytes and other immunocompetent tissue such as the fat body may play a critical role in coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to ensure efficient defense of the organism. Our results suggest that the tissue tropism of E. chaffeensis for phagocytic cells arose approximately 600 million years ago, since that is when mammals and dipterans last shared a common ancestor (Gordon and Waterhouse, 2007; Pesole et al., 1991). Ticks and dipterans last shared a common ancestor approximately 500 million years ago (Ullmann et al., 2005). Therefore, one would expect the tropism for hemocytes to be similar in ticks. However, genetic drift could have occurred in the Ecdysozoa, Arthropoda, or later in the Chelicerata (Gordon and Waterhouse, 2007). There is 59.5% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis Uck2 gene products and 83.6% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis san gene products (Lawson et al., 2009). Therefore, it is not clear, whether this tropism will also be seen in A. americanum, the vector of E. chaffeensis. Additional experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In conclusion, we have used UAS-GAL4 RNAi system in D. melanogaster to show that functional Uck2 and san genes are required for in vivo E. chaffeensis replication. Moreover, we have successfully identified intracellular niches where E. chaffeensis replicates in dipteran arthopods; the hemocytes and fat body of adult D. melanogaster. We hope that understanding the tissue targets of E. chaffeensis in arthropods will help in drug design and RNAi therapeutics for HME and other tick- and arthropod-borne diseases.Acknowledgments We would like to thank Ms. Rachel Nichols, Ms. Victoria Davidson, and Mr. Taylor Kinney for their help with the flies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a major threat to pig production and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust antiviral countermeasures. Pathologically, a significant elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.Methods Using the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02374-2.Keywords: African swine fever virus, Antiviral, Anti-inflammatory, Cytokine production, Screening",

    "methods": "Methods Cells, viruses, and compounds Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, Switzerland) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza, Switzerland), 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza, Switzerland), 100 IU mL− 1 penicillin (Reyoung, China), and 100 µg mL− 1 streptomycin (Arterium, Ukraine) were used to grow Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells at 37 °C. The antiviral screening process and some antiviral assays were conducted by using the Vero-adapted ASFV BA71V strain as specified. We measured the titer of the Vero-adapted ASFV BA71V strain by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay on Vero cells. We used the Spearman-Kärber endpoint method to calculate the titer, which was expressed in log TCID50 mL− 1 units. Experiments with the highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate involved porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) that were prepared as previously reported [19]. The porcine macrophages were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU mL− 1 penicillin, and 100 µg mL− 1 streptomycin. Titration of the ASFV Arm/07 isolate was conducted using the hemadsorption (HAD) assay and expressed in log HADU50 mL− 1 units. A library comprising 297 natural compounds (Additional file 1. Table S1) was obtained from ChemFaces (China). The compounds were selected based on their known anti-inflammatory properties and undocumented efficacy against ASFV. Each compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 5 mg mL− 1 stock solution and diluted in EMEM. Dilutions in the cell culture medium were made to maintain a final DMSO concentration below 1% (v/v). Library screening Confluent Vero cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. The cells were subsequently infected with the ASFV BA71V strain (at 0.2 TCID50 per cell) and immediately treated with test compounds at a concentration of 50 µM, except for some compounds that were tested at 25 µM due to cytotoxic effects (see Table S1) for 72 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation period, once complete CPE (as indicated by cell rounding, detachment, and extensive destruction of cell monolayer) was observed in the untreated wells (Additional file 1. Fig. S1), cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. In brief, Vero cells were washed with cold PBS and MTT solution [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany] was added. The cells were then allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by the extraction of purple formazan using the MTT test solvent (DMSO). The optical density (OD) was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm by using a microplate reader (BioTek Epoch 2, Agilent Technologies, USA). The percentage of CPE inhibition was calculated by the following formula: (ODtv-ODv/ODc-ODv) × 100% where OD refers to the optical density of each well, tv refers to ASFV-infected cells treated with compound, c refers to mock-infected cells without treatment, and v refers to ASFV-infected cells without treatment. ASFV-infected cells treated with a minimal concentration of DMSO (< 0.5%) were utilized as the negative control, while ASFV-infected cells treated with 50 µM of apigenin were used as the positive control. Each plate contained six samples of both negative and positive controls. The OD values obtained from these controls were used to calculate the Z’-factor, which is a statistical parameter to assess the variability of the screening assay [20]. The Z’-factor was calculated by using the following formula: 1-[(3σp + 3σn)/(µp-µn)], where σ refers to the standard deviation, µ refers to the mean, p refers to the positive control, and n refers to the negative control. If the Z’-factor value is between 0.5 and 1.0, then the screening assay performance is considered consistent and robust. Compound validation assays For the yield reduction assay, Vero cells were cultivated in 24-well cell culture plates with a seeding density of 2 × 105 cells per well. The cells were subsequently exposed to the ASFV BA71V strain (at 0.2 TCID50 per cell) and treated with selected compounds at concentrations of 50 µM or 25 µM (for tetrandrine). Following a 72-h incubation period, the supernatant was harvested and titrated. For the virucidal assay, a virus suspension containing 2 × 105 TCID50 ASFV particles was incubated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations for 1 h at room temperature. Then, Vero cells seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (seeding density: 2 × 104 cells per well) were exposed to 20-fold dilutions of the treated viral suspension to eliminate potential virostatic effects of the test compounds on ASFV infection. After a 24-h post-infection, the supernatant was harvested and subjected to titration. Dose-dependent assay Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or PAMs (4 × 104 cells per well) cultured in 24-well plates were subjected to infection with the ASFV BA71V strain [multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 TCID50] or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (MOI of 0.5 HADU50), respectively. Following infection, cells were treated with selected compounds at different concentrations in a two-fold dilution format. The infection was allowed to progress for 24 h, after which the supernatant was harvested and titrated. MOI-dependent assay Vero cells cultured in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain at different MOI values ranging from 0.1 to 1 TCID50 per cell and treated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations. The virus was collected and titrated at 24 h post-infection. Virus replication stage and treatment assays For the ASFV replication cycle experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) cultured in 24-well plates were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain (MOI of 0.2 TCID50) and then treated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations. The infection was allowed to progress for 24, 48, or 72 h, after which the supernatants were harvested and titrated. For time-of-addition experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or PAM cells (4 × 104 cells per well) were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. The wells were marked as − 2, 0, 2, 8, and 16 h, corresponding to the time period relative to the onset of ASFV infection (inoculation). These time points cover the early, middle, and late stages of ASFV infection during one replication cycle. In the pre-infection format, Vero cells or macrophages were exposed to the selected compounds before (− 2 h) infection with the ASFV BA71V strain (0.2 TCID50 per cell) or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (0.5 HADU50 per cell). In the co-infection format, Vero cells were simultaneously exposed to compounds and ASFV. In the post-infection format, cells were infected with ASFV and the compounds were then added at 2, 8, or 16 h post-infection. The supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and titrated. For time-of-removal experiments, Vero cells grown in 24-well cell culture plates were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain and treated with compounds at indicated concentrations. Afterwards, the compound was removed after incubation at 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, or 16-h post-treatment. This removal step was done by washing the cells with 1× PBS and replacing the media. The supernatant was then collected and titrated 24 h post-infection. Virus entry assays In the virus attachment experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or macrophages (4 × 104 cells per well) were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. The cells were incubated with the ASFV BA71V strain (0.2 TCID50) or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (0.5 HADU50), respectively, along with the test compounds at 4°C for 1 h. This step was done to facilitate virus binding while preventing internalization. Following this procedure, the unbound virus and compound were removed by thoroughly washing the cells with 1× PBS. Fresh medium containing 3% FBS was then added. Virus in the supernatant was collected and titrated 24 h post-infection. In the internalization experiments, Vero cells or macrophages were infected with ASFV BA71V or ASFV Arm/07, respectively, at 4 °C for 1 h. Following this step, unbound virus was removed by thoroughly washing the cells with 1× PBS. The compounds were then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C, allowing virus entry to proceed for 1 h. Subsequently, the compounds were removed by washing with 1× PBS to prevent their effect on later stages of infection. The infection was then allowed to continue for 24 h, after which the supernatants were collected and titrated. Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicity of natural compounds was examined in Vero cells and PAMs by using the crystal violet staining method [21]. Cells (2 × 104 cells per well) reached confluence and were then exposed to increasing compound concentrations, which ranged from 3.1 µM to 50 µM. The cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following incubation, the cell culture medium was discarded and a 4% crystal violet solution (in ethanol) was added to the wells. The solution was allowed to incubate for 40 min at room temperature. Then, the wells were washed with distilled water, and 200 µL of methanol was added to each well for 20 min. The OD of each well was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader (BioTek Epoch 2, Agilent Technologies, USA). The relative viability of the treated cells compared to mock-treated cells (no compound) was expressed as a percentage and calculated at each concentration using the following formula: ODt/ODc × 100%, where ODt and ODc correspond to the absorbance of treated and negative control (mock-treated) cells, respectively. Western blotting Vero cells (5 × 105 cells per well) were grown in 6-well cell culture plates and infected with ASFV at a MOI of 2 TCID50 in the presence or absence of test compounds at two different compound concentrations. After 24 h, the cells were dissociated using Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C, electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies p30, p72, or tubulin (Sigma Aldrich) at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:1000, and 1:2000, respectively. Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by using a Chemidoc XRS imaging system from BioRad. Cytokine quantification The release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokines into the culture medium was quantified using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, USA). Experiments were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For each cytokine, a standard curve was plotted, which represented the cytokine concentration as a function of the OD value. The standard curve was used to derive a linear regression equation, which was then utilized to determine the concentration of each cytokine released. Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) of three independent experiments. The unpaired Student’s t-test (versus virus-only positive control) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (versus other test groups) were used for antiviral and anti-inflammatory experiments, respectively. Statistical significance was computed in terms of standard or multiplicity-adjusted P values as appropriate, and P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001 indicate the levels of statistical significance (*, **, ***) while ns indicates a non-significant effect (P > 0.05). The GraphPad Prism software program (version 10.0.2, GraphPad Software, USA) was used to calculate 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values by variable slope analysis (four-parameter logistic curve) of absolute virus quantities with appropriate units as a function of compound concentration. The IC50 values correspond to the compound concentrations needed to reduce viral infectivity by 50%.",
    "results": "Results Antiviral screening of natural compound library We screened a 297-member library of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties (see Table S1). The compounds belong to 17 distinct classes of natural compounds (Fig. 1A). Alkaloids, phenols, and triterpenoids represented approximately 16%, 11%, and 10% of all tested compounds, respectively. The screening process was conducted by using a cell-based colorimetric assay in combination with the MTT method to track CPE development [22]. Compounds were tested at 50 µM concentrations, except for some compounds that were tested at 25 µM concentration due to cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (cf. Table S1). Each screening plate contained negative and positive control wells, which allowed us to calculate the maximum (positive control) and minimum (negative control) MTT optimal density values to generate Z’-factor values. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Screening of anti-inflammatory compound library for anti-ASFV activity. ASFV-infected Vero cells were incubated with each compound at the defined concentration and the inhibitory effect on virus-induced CPE was measured by MTT assay at 72 h post-infection. (A) Percentage of anti-inflammatory compounds in 297-member library belonging to different molecular classes and experimental steps. (B) Z’ score of each plate in the screen, which was calculated by using the minimum (negative control: DMSO) and maximum (positive control: apigenin) MTT signals. (C) Percentage inhibition of virus-induced CPE by tested compounds. Compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by ≥ 50% and did not damage cell monolayer were defined as positive hits. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and mean values are presented for clarity. (D) Five top-performing compounds selected for further mechanistic studiesAll 66 plates (n = 3) had Z’ scores higher than 0.5 and the lowest and highest Z’ score values of individual plates were 0.575 and 0.721, respectively (Fig. 1B). The average Z’ score value was 0.646, which indicated that the entire screening process had high consistency and was robust for the screening of anti-ASFV compounds [20]. To select hit candidates, we applied the following two criteria: (a) > 50% inhibition of ASFV-induced CPE; and (b) no destruction of cell monolayer upon treatment. Based on these criteria, five compounds, namely paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine, were selected based on CPE inhibition levels of 54%, 57%, 66%, 86%, and 101%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Paeonol and curcumin are both phenolic compounds, whereas pinoresinol is classified as a tetrahydrofuran lignan (Fig. 1D). By contrast, berbamine and tetrandrine have significantly more complex chemical structures than the other three compounds and are both classified as bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Validation of positive-hit compounds against ASFV We conducted virus yield reduction experiments to further validate the antiviral effect of the selected five compounds. Vero cells were infected with ASFV and simultaneously exposed to compounds at 50 µM concentration, except for tetrandrine that was used at 25 µM concentration. The infection was allowed to progress for 72 h until complete CPE was observed in the negative controls (virus only), at which point the supernatant was harvested and titrated. All five compounds displayed statistically significant (p < 0.05) antiviral effects on ASFV replication in Vero cells (Fig. 2A). Tetrandrine significantly decreased the viral titer from 6.4 ± 0.1 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.8 ± 0.1 log TCID50 mL− 1, resulting in a 3.6 log reduction, and berbamine had the second greatest inhibitory effect. By contrast, paenol and pinoresinol exhibited the weakest inhibitory effects, reducing the viral yield by only 1 log, and curcumin had only a slightly greater inhibitory effect. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Antiviral validation of selected anti-inflammatory compounds. (A) Antiviral activity of compounds to inhibit ASFV infection in Vero cells. Virus and compound were added at the same time to cells and the viral titer in supernatant was measured. (B) Direct (virucidal) effect of compounds on extracellular ASFV particles. Virus and compound were pre-mixed, incubated, diluted 20-fold, and then the diluted virus-compound mixture was added to infect cells. The viral titer in supernatant was measured. (C) Vero cell viability after incubation with different compound concentrations, as evaluated by crystal violet staining method. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to a 20% drop in relative cell viability. The relative viability of mock-treated cells was defined as 100%. In panels (A) and (B), all compounds were tested at 50 µM except for tetrandrine, which was tested at 25 µM. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01To further investigate whether the compounds exhibit a direct antiviral effect on ASFV, we also conducted a virucidal assay. The virus suspension was pre-incubated with compounds for 1 h and then the mixture was diluted 20-fold to sub-inhibitory concentrations before adding the diluted virus-compound mixtures to the Vero cells. At 24 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and titrated. The test compounds did not exhibit virucidal activity (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the observed antiviral effects of these compounds cannot be attributed to a direct impact on ASFV particles. Furthermore, the compounds did not demonstrate cytotoxicity at tested concentrations, indicating that their antiviral effects were independent of cell toxicity (Fig. 2C). The two most potent compounds, berbamine and tetrandrine, were selected for further studies. Antiviral mechanism of action of berbamine and tetrandrine Our initial evaluation of mechanistic aspects was carried out during a single ASFV replication cycle and virus was collected at 24 h post-infection, which corresponds to the time duration required for one full cycle of ASFV BA71V strain infection kinetics in Vero cells [23, 24]. First, we studied whether berbamine and tetrandrine may exhibit antiviral activity at lower compound concentrations. Vero cells infected with ASFV were treated with berbamine and tetrandrine at varying concentrations. The inhibitory effect of both compounds occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, B). Statistically significant antiviral activity (p < 0.05) was observed at the lowest concentrations of 12.5 µM for berbamine and 3.1 µM for tetrandrine. The IC50 value for berbamine was calculated to be 8.4 µM, while the IC50 value of tetrandrine was 2.2 µM. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV in Vero cells. (A) ASFV titer for cells exposed to berbamine at increasing concentrations from 3.1 µM to 50 µM. (B) ASFV titer for cells exposed to tetrandrine at increasing concentrations from 1.6 µM to 25 µM. (C) Western blot analysis of ASFV protein synthesis in ASFV-infected cells exposed to berbamine and tetrandrine at selected concentrations. Tubulin served as a loading control and cropping was done to show regions of interest. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on Vero cells infected with ASFV at different MOIs. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments in panel (C) were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01Dose-dependent antiviral effects were also observed when evaluating the synthesis of early (p30) and late (p72) ASFV proteins (Fig. 3C). Berbamine and tetrandrine significantly hampered the synthesis of p30 and p72 proteins at 50 µM and 25 µM concentrations, respectively, whereas the inhibitory effect was less pronounced at lower concentrations. Then, we studied the inhibitory effects of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV replication at different MOIs. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in viral yield following treatment with berbamine and tetrandrine at different MOIs, resulting in a decrease of approximately 1-1.1 log and 1.1–1.5 log, respectively (Fig. 3D). This result supports that the antiviral efficacy of these compounds is consistent regardless of the initial viral load infecting the cells. In our primary screen, we observed an ∼ 3 log reduction after treatment with 25 µM tetrandrine. However, during the single replication cycle experiments, we observed only a 1-log reduction. This difference led us to propose that tetrandrine can block ASFV replication in subsequent cycles. Indeed, the suppression of ASFV replication by berbamine and tetrandrine tended to be greater when the virus was collected at 72 h post-infection compared to 24- and 48-h post-infection (Fig. 4A). This finding indicates that both compounds exerted their antiviral effects across multiple rounds of virus replication. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Mechanistic analysis of antiviral activity by berbamine and tetrandrine. (A) Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine to inhibit ASFV in Vero cells depending on the virus replication duration, as indicated by supernatant collection time post-infection.

(C) Antiviral activity depending on the time of addition. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by Vero cells. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine in all experiments were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. nd refers to not determined (below detection limit). Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01As the greatest antiviral effect was observed at 72 h post-infection, we also studied the incubation duration required for 1-log (90% inhibition) reduction. For this purpose, berbamine and tetrandrine were added to ASFV-infected Vero cells at 0 h post-infection and removed by medium replacement after specific intervals. The virus was collected at 24 h post-infection and quantified. As expected, our results showed a gradual decrease in viral titers as the interval between infection and compound removal increased (Fig. 4B). Berbamine demonstrated a 1-log reduction in viral titer when ASFV-infected cells were exposed to this compound for 24 h. In contrast, tetrandrine achieved a similar level of viral titer reduction after 16 h of treatment. Next, we determined the specific replication stages of ASFV infection that are affected by berbamine and tetrandrine. Compounds were added at five time points before and after infection, followed by virus collection and titration at 24 h post-infection. The most significant antiviral effects of berbamine and tetrandrine were observed when cells were pre-treated with compound or co-treated with compound alongside ASFV infection (Fig. 4C). Berbamine reduced the viral yield from 3.98 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.25 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) when added at 0 h, in parallel to ASFV infection. Similarly, tetrandrine decreased the ASFV titer from 3.98 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.31 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) during co-addition. By contrast, there was no statistically significant antiviral effect on ASFV replication when berbamine and tetrandrine were added at 16 h post-infection. These results suggest that both compounds hamper ASFV replication by interfering with early stages of infection. Therefore, we further studied the effect of these compounds on the viral entry stage, which consists of virus attachment and internalization substages. To investigate the effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to Vero cells, compounds were added at 4 °C, in which condition virus particles bind to but do not enter cells. Treatment with berbamine and tetrandrine inhibited virus particle attachment to Vero cells, resulting in a decrease of the ASFV yield from 3.92 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.64 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) and 2.47 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 4D). A more significant decrease was observed when compounds were added at the ASFV internalization stage. Berbamine and tetrandrine were added immediately after a temperature shift from 4 °C to 37 °C and removed after 1 h of treatment in order to minimize further antiviral effects on later stages of ASFV replication. Both compounds reduced the viral yield below the detection limit corresponding to < 2.2 log TCID50 mL− 1. Altogether, these results indicate that berbamine and tetrandrine inhibit ASFV infection by blocking virus entry. Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs Monocytes and macrophages are the main target cells for ASFV replication in pigs. Since ASFV has different entry mechanisms into Vero cells and PAMs [25], we studied the antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs as well. For these experiments, we used the highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate that is capable of infecting PAMs and causes disease in pigs [26, 27]. First, we incubated ASFV-infected PAMs with increasing concentrations of compounds that were not toxic to PAMs within the testing range (Additional file 1. Fig. S2). Both compounds decreased the viral titer in a dose-dependent manner and the corresponding IC50 values of berbamine and tetrandrine were 11.6 µM and 3.0 µM, respectively (Fig. 5A, B). Based on these initial results, we used the highest non-toxic concentrations (50 µM and 25 µM for berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively) in further time-of-addition and virus entry experiments. Time-of-addition experiments were conducted with the same five different time points before and after infection as in the case of the Vero cell experiments, and the results showed a similar pattern of inhibition (Fig. 5C). The most potent inhibitory effects were observed due to pre- and co-treatment of PAM cells with the compounds. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV Arm/07 isolate in PAM cells. ASFV titer in cells exposed to different concentrations of (A) berbamine (3.1–50 µM) or (B) tetrandrine (1.6–25 µM). (C) Antiviral activity depending on the time of addition. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by PAM cells. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments in panels (C) and (D) were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01Then, we conducted experiments to reveal the effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by PAMs. When berbamine and tetrandrine were added at the virus attachment substage, they decreased the ASFV yield from 5.03 ± 0.16 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 3.25 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) and 2.92 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 5D). A more potent inhibitory effect was observed when the compounds were added at the internalization substage. Berbamine reduced the viral titer from 4.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 2.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1, while tetrandrine also blocked ASFV internalization, resulting in a virus titer decrease from 4.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 2.25 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1. Based on these results, we conclude that berbamine and tetrandrine exerted significant inhibition of ASFV infection by disrupting the viral entry process. This inhibition was observed independently from the host cell type or ASFV strain used in our experiments. Anti-inflammatory activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs As the natural compounds in the library were initially selected due to their anti-inflammatory properties, we also investigated the potential of berbamine and tetrandrine to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by ASFV-infected PAMs. While both compounds have generally recognized anti-inflammatory properties such as reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages (see, e.g., Refs [28, 29]), their effects on curbing ASFV infection-related inflammation are unknown. As different immune-activating biological processes can involve various signaling pathways [30], it is thus important to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects in disease-specific contexts in terms of the etiological agent, cell type, and measured inflammation markers. Therefore, we quantified TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokine levels in PAM culture supernatants that were collected at 24- and 48-h post-infection using commercially available ELISA kits. Following a similar protocol, our experimental approach was first validated by measuring cytokine levels in uninfected PAMs incubated with LPS (1 µg mL− 1) with or without berbamine or tetrandrine (Additional file 1. Fig. S3). The results demonstrated that both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-1β production in LPS-treated PAMs at both time points as expected. Of note, tetrandrine also exhibited significant inhibition of IL-6 production, whereas the effect of berbamine on that cytokine was not statistically significant. We proceeded to test the anti-inflammatory properties of berbamine and tetrandrine in an ASFV-focused context by infecting PAMs with ASFV with or without berbamine or tetrandrine treatment before proceeding to measure cytokine production levels. In this format, the cytokine levels produced by PAMs increased following infection with the ASFV Arm/07 isolate, which is consistent with previously reported findings [31, 32]. In particular, the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels increased by around 18-, 11-, and 13-fold, respectively, at 24 h post-infection and by around 23-, 22-, and 21-fold, respectively, at 48 h post-infection compared to uninfected PAMs. Importantly, berbamine and tetrandrine treatment had strong effects on inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared to the levels found in untreated ASFV-infected cells. At 24 h post-infection, both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels compared to the ASFV control by around 60–80% (Fig. 6A-C). Notably, at 48 h post-infection, both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly reduced TNF-α levels by around 37% and 81% respectively, while the inhibitory effect of tetrandrine was greater (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6D). Both compounds also reduced IL-1β levels at 48 h post-infection by around 49% and 78%, respectively, and the results were statistically similar in this case (Fig. 6E). Importantly, only tetrandrine significantly reduced IL-6 levels at 48 h post-infection by around 62%, whereas the effect of berberine was insignificant (Fig. 6F). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in ASFV-infected PAMs. Effect of berbamine (Ber) or tetrandrine (Tet) on inhibition of (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β, and (C) IL-6 production in ASFV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection. (D-F) Corresponding measurements at 48 h post-infection. Cytokine measurements were performed by ELISA on collected supernatants. The concentration of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to other test groups are denoted by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001Thus, both compounds displayed anti-inflammatory activity in ASFV-infected PAMs while tetrandrine demonstrated a superior activity profile in terms of greater inhibitory levels and more sustained effect throughout the course of infection. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that both compounds, especially tetrandrine with its high effectiveness, possess the ability to not only impede ASFV replication but also to mitigate ASFV-induced production of clinically important pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
    "discussion": "Discussion ASFV remains a significant threat to the global swine industry and is characterized by its devastating impact on pig populations and the absence of approved vaccines or specific antiviral therapies [33]. The absence of preventive measures against ASFV highlights the critical need to discover effective interventions to control and manage this highly contagious disease in pigs. Within this context, the exploration of natural compounds with potential antiviral properties has gained immense importance and highlights the opportunity to identify novel inhibitory strategies to combat ASFV infection [9]. In this work, the screening of a library of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties led to the identification of five promising candidates—paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine—that showed substantial inhibition of ASFV-induced CPE without affecting cell monolayers. These compounds belong to distinct classes, with berbamine and tetrandrine exhibiting more complex chemical structures compared to the other lead candidates. Subsequent validation experiments in Vero cells confirmed the antiviral efficacy of these compounds against ASFV replication. Tetrandrine displayed the most potent effect, achieving a 3.6 log reduction in viral titer, while paeonol and pinoresinol exhibited weaker inhibitory effects. Notably, none of these five compounds demonstrated virucidal activity or cytotoxic effects at tested concentrations, confirming the specificity of their antiviral activities. Recently, Zhu et al. and Qian et al. independently reported the antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV in vitro [34, 35], thereby additionally validating the robustness of our screening results. In the present context, further mechanistic investigations focused on berbamine and tetrandrine revealed their dose-dependent antiviral activities, inhibiting the synthesis of ASFV proteins and consistently reducing viral yields across different MOIs. Time-of-addition experiments elucidated the compounds’ action points within the viral replication cycle, highlighting their significant impact during pre- and co-treatment phases. Berbamine and tetrandrine significantly inhibited ASFV replication by interfering with early infection stages, particularly virus attachment and internalization into host cells, that in turn disrupted viral entry. Interestingly, both compounds exhibited sustained antiviral effects over multiple replication cycles (cf. Figure 4A). This finding fits with the relatively long half-lives that have been reported for both compounds [36], which supports their capability to impact ASFV replication over several cycles. Given that both compounds also exhibited antiviral activity during early stages of viral infection post-internalization in the present experiments (cf. Figure 4C), it is reasonable that the most significant antiviral effect was observed during the prolonged presence of compounds in the cell culture medium (cf. Figure 4B) and the results are consistent with their effects on virus replication at various stages, especially viral entry. Furthermore, extending the study to primary target cells, porcine macrophages, revealed consistent antiviral effects of berbamine and tetrandrine. Notably, these compounds inhibited ASFV infection by disrupting viral entry mechanisms, suggesting that their antiviral mechanism is irrespective of host cell type or virus strain. It has been reported that tetrandrine inhibits Ebola virus entry into human monocyte-derived macrophages by disrupting endosomal Ca2+ channels [37]. In addition, berbamine suppresses the replication of Japanese encephalitis virus by blocking Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channels in endosomes [38]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that comparable inhibitory mechanisms might play a role in exerting antiviral effects against ASFV. Conducting further experiments could potentially unveil the involvement of endosomal Ca2+ channels in ASFV infection in future work. Importantly, we also demonstrated that berbamine and tetrandrine effectively reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in ASFV-infected macrophages, which had not been explored before. Among these cytokines, TNF-α is considered to play an essential role in driving pathological changes observed in ASFV-infected pigs [13, 39]. Therefore, compounds such as berbamine and tetrandrine can not only suppress viral replication but also demonstrate the capability to mitigate pathological conditions associated with the heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to viral infection. Of note, tetrandrine exhibited a particularly high and sustained level of anti-inflammatory activity in the ASFV infection context and, together with its high antiviral activity, supports that it has promising merits. These findings are particularly significant because berbamine and tetrandrine, along with other bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, have also been recently reported to inhibit porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with similar potency [40, 41], suggesting their broad utility as porcine virus countermeasures. At the same time, previous studies have focused on validating the antiviral activity of these compounds and did not evaluate potential infection-related anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings expand on this viewpoint and demonstrate proof-of-principle to show that the anti-inflammatory properties of berbamine and tetrandrine are translatable to inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during viral infection along with reducing viral load.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions In conclusion, our results indicate that berbamine and tetrandrine possess dual inhibitory activities: potent antiviral activity against ASFV, primarily through disrupting viral entry mechanisms; and significant inhibition of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, these compounds hold promise as potential preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection, with tetrandrine exhibiting particularly robust antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that warrant further investigation and development.",

Copyright notice ID: 11046949 PMID: 38664855 Abstract Background African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a major threat to pig production and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust antiviral countermeasures. Pathologically, a significant elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities.Methods Using the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine.Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02374-2.Keywords: African swine fever virus, Antiviral, Anti-inflammatory, Cytokine production, ScreeningBackground African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent of African swine fever (ASF), which is a highly infectious hemorrhagic disease of domestic pigs and wild boars with mortality rates close to 100% [1, 2]. ASF causes heavy losses to the pork industry of affected countries due to the lack of effective vaccines [3, 4]. In 2018, ASF outbreaks were reported in China and neighboring countries that are collectively responsible for almost half of the world’s pork production, thereby presenting a global threat to the pork supply [5]. This issue has led to strict biosecurity practices to prevent ASF spread as well as the search for natural compounds with antiviral properties that can mitigate ASFV in potential transmission vectors such as water and feed [6–8]. In addition to these preventative measures, there is high interest in discovering natural compounds that might also be capable of curbing ASFV infection in pigs based on inhibiting viral genome replication along with reducing disease symptoms such as inflammation [9]. Pigs infected with highly virulent ASFV strains display high fever, with temperatures up to 42 °C, lethargy, inactivity, and anorexia [10]. The affected animals usually show cyanosis, nasal discharges, vomiting, and diarrhea. Animals die within 7 days from the onset of disease. Hemorrhagic splenomegaly and lymphadenitis are recorded during post-mortem observations. Hemorrhagic lesions may also be observed with less frequency in other organs. While various pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed as primary contributors to hemorrhages, the current consensus identifies pro-inflammatory cytokine production as the initial cause of lesions in ASF [11, 12]. Serum analysis of infected pigs revealed a significant elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12, which is commonly referred to as “cytokine storm” [13]. The “cytokine storm” effect is common for several highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and Ebola virus, and can result in multiple organ failure and mortality [14]. Thus, controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine production may prevent disease progression and reduce the mortality rate associated with ASF and other viral diseases. Previously, the antiviral efficacy of some natural compounds possessing generally recognized anti-inflammatory properties was studied against ASFV. For instance, we have reported that the flavonoid apigenin significantly inhibited ASFV replication in immortalized Vero cells [15]. Genkwanin, a natural derivative of apigenin, also exerted potent anti-ASFV activity in Vero cells and porcine macrophages (PAMs) [16]. These results prompted us to consider the potential of other anti-inflammatory natural compounds as inhibitors of ASFV infection. Such compounds may have the potential to act as dual-purpose antiviral drugs, which are capable of not only inhibiting ASFV replication but also mitigating the “cytokine storm” associated with ASFV infection. Herein, we applied a small library screening approach to evaluate the antiviral activity of 297 natural compounds with generally recognized anti-inflammatory properties. The screen was conducted using the laboratory-adapted, non-virulent ASFV BA71V strain [17] and led us to identify five natural compounds that inhibited virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by greater than 50%. Virus yield reduction experiments identified that two of these anti-inflammatory compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. The antiviral effects of tetrandrine and berbamine on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in PAMs were also confirmed. Notably, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds, especially tetrandrine, markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α that plays a key role in ASF disease pathogenesis [18].Methods Cells, viruses, and compounds Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, Switzerland) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza, Switzerland), 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza, Switzerland), 100 IU mL− 1 penicillin (Reyoung, China), and 100 µg mL− 1 streptomycin (Arterium, Ukraine) were used to grow Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells at 37 °C. The antiviral screening process and some antiviral assays were conducted by using the Vero-adapted ASFV BA71V strain as specified. We measured the titer of the Vero-adapted ASFV BA71V strain by cytopathic effect (CPE) assay on Vero cells. We used the Spearman-Kärber endpoint method to calculate the titer, which was expressed in log TCID50 mL− 1 units. Experiments with the highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate involved porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) that were prepared as previously reported [19]. The porcine macrophages were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU mL− 1 penicillin, and 100 µg mL− 1 streptomycin. Titration of the ASFV Arm/07 isolate was conducted using the hemadsorption (HAD) assay and expressed in log HADU50 mL− 1 units. A library comprising 297 natural compounds (Additional file 1. Table S1) was obtained from ChemFaces (China). The compounds were selected based on their known anti-inflammatory properties and undocumented efficacy against ASFV. Each compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 5 mg mL− 1 stock solution and diluted in EMEM. Dilutions in the cell culture medium were made to maintain a final DMSO concentration below 1% (v/v).Library screening Confluent Vero cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well. The cells were subsequently infected with the ASFV BA71V strain (at 0.2 TCID50 per cell) and immediately treated with test compounds at a concentration of 50 µM, except for some compounds that were tested at 25 µM due to cytotoxic effects (see Table S1) for 72 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation period, once complete CPE (as indicated by cell rounding, detachment, and extensive destruction of cell monolayer) was observed in the untreated wells (Additional file 1. Fig. S1), cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. In brief, Vero cells were washed with cold PBS and MTT solution [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany] was added. The cells were then allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by the extraction of purple formazan using the MTT test solvent (DMSO). The optical density (OD) was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm by using a microplate reader (BioTek Epoch 2, Agilent Technologies, USA). The percentage of CPE inhibition was calculated by the following formula: (ODtv-ODv/ODc-ODv) × 100% where OD refers to the optical density of each well, tv refers to ASFV-infected cells treated with compound, c refers to mock-infected cells without treatment, and v refers to ASFV-infected cells without treatment. ASFV-infected cells treated with a minimal concentration of DMSO (< 0.5%) were utilized as the negative control, while ASFV-infected cells treated with 50 µM of apigenin were used as the positive control. Each plate contained six samples of both negative and positive controls. The OD values obtained from these controls were used to calculate the Z’-factor, which is a statistical parameter to assess the variability of the screening assay [20]. The Z’-factor was calculated by using the following formula: 1-[(3σp + 3σn)/(µp-µn)], where σ refers to the standard deviation, µ refers to the mean, p refers to the positive control, and n refers to the negative control. If the Z’-factor value is between 0.5 and 1.0, then the screening assay performance is considered consistent and robust.Compound validation assays For the yield reduction assay, Vero cells were cultivated in 24-well cell culture plates with a seeding density of 2 × 105 cells per well. The cells were subsequently exposed to the ASFV BA71V strain (at 0.2 TCID50 per cell) and treated with selected compounds at concentrations of 50 µM or 25 µM (for tetrandrine). Following a 72-h incubation period, the supernatant was harvested and titrated. For the virucidal assay, a virus suspension containing 2 × 105 TCID50 ASFV particles was incubated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations for 1 h at room temperature. Then, Vero cells seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (seeding density: 2 × 104 cells per well) were exposed to 20-fold dilutions of the treated viral suspension to eliminate potential virostatic effects of the test compounds on ASFV infection. After a 24-h post-infection, the supernatant was harvested and subjected to titration.Dose-dependent assay Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or PAMs (4 × 104 cells per well) cultured in 24-well plates were subjected to infection with the ASFV BA71V strain [multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 TCID50] or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (MOI of 0.5 HADU50), respectively. Following infection, cells were treated with selected compounds at different concentrations in a two-fold dilution format. The infection was allowed to progress for 24 h, after which the supernatant was harvested and titrated.MOI-dependent assay Vero cells cultured in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain at different MOI values ranging from 0.1 to 1 TCID50 per cell and treated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations. The virus was collected and titrated at 24 h post-infection.Virus replication stage and treatment assays For the ASFV replication cycle experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) cultured in 24-well plates were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain (MOI of 0.2 TCID50) and then treated with selected compounds at indicated concentrations. The infection was allowed to progress for 24, 48, or 72 h, after which the supernatants were harvested and titrated. For time-of-addition experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or PAM cells (4 × 104 cells per well) were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. The wells were marked as − 2, 0, 2, 8, and 16 h, corresponding to the time period relative to the onset of ASFV infection (inoculation). These time points cover the early, middle, and late stages of ASFV infection during one replication cycle. In the pre-infection format, Vero cells or macrophages were exposed to the selected compounds before (− 2 h) infection with the ASFV BA71V strain (0.2 TCID50 per cell) or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (0.5 HADU50 per cell). In the co-infection format, Vero cells were simultaneously exposed to compounds and ASFV. In the post-infection format, cells were infected with ASFV and the compounds were then added at 2, 8, or 16 h post-infection. The supernatants were collected at 24 h post-infection and titrated. For time-of-removal experiments, Vero cells grown in 24-well cell culture plates were infected with the ASFV BA71V strain and treated with compounds at indicated concentrations. Afterwards, the compound was removed after incubation at 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, or 16-h post-treatment. This removal step was done by washing the cells with 1× PBS and replacing the media. The supernatant was then collected and titrated 24 h post-infection.Virus entry assays In the virus attachment experiments, Vero cells (2 × 105 cells per well) or macrophages (4 × 104 cells per well) were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. The cells were incubated with the ASFV BA71V strain (0.2 TCID50) or ASFV Arm/07 isolate (0.5 HADU50), respectively, along with the test compounds at 4°C for 1 h. This step was done to facilitate virus binding while preventing internalization. Following this procedure, the unbound virus and compound were removed by thoroughly washing the cells with 1× PBS. Fresh medium containing 3% FBS was then added. Virus in the supernatant was collected and titrated 24 h post-infection. In the internalization experiments, Vero cells or macrophages were infected with ASFV BA71V or ASFV Arm/07, respectively, at 4 °C for 1 h. Following this step, unbound virus was removed by thoroughly washing the cells with 1× PBS. The compounds were then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C, allowing virus entry to proceed for 1 h. Subsequently, the compounds were removed by washing with 1× PBS to prevent their effect on later stages of infection. The infection was then allowed to continue for 24 h, after which the supernatants were collected and titrated.Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicity of natural compounds was examined in Vero cells and PAMs by using the crystal violet staining method [21]. Cells (2 × 104 cells per well) reached confluence and were then exposed to increasing compound concentrations, which ranged from 3.1 µM to 50 µM. The cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following incubation, the cell culture medium was discarded and a 4% crystal violet solution (in ethanol) was added to the wells. The solution was allowed to incubate for 40 min at room temperature. Then, the wells were washed with distilled water, and 200 µL of methanol was added to each well for 20 min. The OD of each well was measured at 570 nm using a plate reader (BioTek Epoch 2, Agilent Technologies, USA). The relative viability of the treated cells compared to mock-treated cells (no compound) was expressed as a percentage and calculated at each concentration using the following formula: ODt/ODc × 100%, where ODt and ODc correspond to the absorbance of treated and negative control (mock-treated) cells, respectively.Western blotting Vero cells (5 × 105 cells per well) were grown in 6-well cell culture plates and infected with ASFV at a MOI of 2 TCID50 in the presence or absence of test compounds at two different compound concentrations. After 24 h, the cells were dissociated using Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C, electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies p30, p72, or tubulin (Sigma Aldrich) at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:1000, and 1:2000, respectively. Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by using a Chemidoc XRS imaging system from BioRad.Cytokine quantification The release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokines into the culture medium was quantified using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, USA). Experiments were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For each cytokine, a standard curve was plotted, which represented the cytokine concentration as a function of the OD value. The standard curve was used to derive a linear regression equation, which was then utilized to determine the concentration of each cytokine released.Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (s.d.) of three independent experiments. The unpaired Student’s t-test (versus virus-only positive control) and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (versus other test groups) were used for antiviral and anti-inflammatory experiments, respectively. Statistical significance was computed in terms of standard or multiplicity-adjusted P values as appropriate, and P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001 indicate the levels of statistical significance (*, **, ***) while ns indicates a non-significant effect (P > 0.05). The GraphPad Prism software program (version 10.0.2, GraphPad Software, USA) was used to calculate 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values by variable slope analysis (four-parameter logistic curve) of absolute virus quantities with appropriate units as a function of compound concentration. The IC50 values correspond to the compound concentrations needed to reduce viral infectivity by 50%.Results Antiviral screening of natural compound library We screened a 297-member library of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties (see Table S1). The compounds belong to 17 distinct classes of natural compounds (Fig. 1A). Alkaloids, phenols, and triterpenoids represented approximately 16%, 11%, and 10% of all tested compounds, respectively. The screening process was conducted by using a cell-based colorimetric assay in combination with the MTT method to track CPE development [22]. Compounds were tested at 50 µM concentrations, except for some compounds that were tested at 25 µM concentration due to cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (cf. Table S1). Each screening plate contained negative and positive control wells, which allowed us to calculate the maximum (positive control) and minimum (negative control) MTT optimal density values to generate Z’-factor values. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Screening of anti-inflammatory compound library for anti-ASFV activity. ASFV-infected Vero cells were incubated with each compound at the defined concentration and the inhibitory effect on virus-induced CPE was measured by MTT assay at 72 h post-infection. (A) Percentage of anti-inflammatory compounds in 297-member library belonging to different molecular classes and experimental steps. (B) Z’ score of each plate in the screen, which was calculated by using the minimum (negative control: DMSO) and maximum (positive control: apigenin) MTT signals. (C) Percentage inhibition of virus-induced CPE by tested compounds. Compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by ≥ 50% and did not damage cell monolayer were defined as positive hits. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and mean values are presented for clarity. (D) Five top-performing compounds selected for further mechanistic studiesAll 66 plates (n = 3) had Z’ scores higher than 0.5 and the lowest and highest Z’ score values of individual plates were 0.575 and 0.721, respectively (Fig. 1B). The average Z’ score value was 0.646, which indicated that the entire screening process had high consistency and was robust for the screening of anti-ASFV compounds [20]. To select hit candidates, we applied the following two criteria: (a) > 50% inhibition of ASFV-induced CPE; and (b) no destruction of cell monolayer upon treatment. Based on these criteria, five compounds, namely paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine, were selected based on CPE inhibition levels of 54%, 57%, 66%, 86%, and 101%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Paeonol and curcumin are both phenolic compounds, whereas pinoresinol is classified as a tetrahydrofuran lignan (Fig. 1D). By contrast, berbamine and tetrandrine have significantly more complex chemical structures than the other three compounds and are both classified as bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.Validation of positive-hit compounds against ASFV We conducted virus yield reduction experiments to further validate the antiviral effect of the selected five compounds. Vero cells were infected with ASFV and simultaneously exposed to compounds at 50 µM concentration, except for tetrandrine that was used at 25 µM concentration. The infection was allowed to progress for 72 h until complete CPE was observed in the negative controls (virus only), at which point the supernatant was harvested and titrated. All five compounds displayed statistically significant (p < 0.05) antiviral effects on ASFV replication in Vero cells (Fig. 2A). Tetrandrine significantly decreased the viral titer from 6.4 ± 0.1 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.8 ± 0.1 log TCID50 mL− 1, resulting in a 3.6 log reduction, and berbamine had the second greatest inhibitory effect. By contrast, paenol and pinoresinol exhibited the weakest inhibitory effects, reducing the viral yield by only 1 log, and curcumin had only a slightly greater inhibitory effect. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Antiviral validation of selected anti-inflammatory compounds. (A) Antiviral activity of compounds to inhibit ASFV infection in Vero cells. Virus and compound were added at the same time to cells and the viral titer in supernatant was measured. (B) Direct (virucidal) effect of compounds on extracellular ASFV particles. Virus and compound were pre-mixed, incubated, diluted 20-fold, and then the diluted virus-compound mixture was added to infect cells. The viral titer in supernatant was measured. (C) Vero cell viability after incubation with different compound concentrations, as evaluated by crystal violet staining method. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to a 20% drop in relative cell viability. The relative viability of mock-treated cells was defined as 100%. In panels (A) and (B), all compounds were tested at 50 µM except for tetrandrine, which was tested at 25 µM. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01To further investigate whether the compounds exhibit a direct antiviral effect on ASFV, we also conducted a virucidal assay. The virus suspension was pre-incubated with compounds for 1 h and then the mixture was diluted 20-fold to sub-inhibitory concentrations before adding the diluted virus-compound mixtures to the Vero cells. At 24 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and titrated. The test compounds did not exhibit virucidal activity (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the observed antiviral effects of these compounds cannot be attributed to a direct impact on ASFV particles. Furthermore, the compounds did not demonstrate cytotoxicity at tested concentrations, indicating that their antiviral effects were independent of cell toxicity (Fig. 2C). The two most potent compounds, berbamine and tetrandrine, were selected for further studies.Antiviral mechanism of action of berbamine and tetrandrine Our initial evaluation of mechanistic aspects was carried out during a single ASFV replication cycle and virus was collected at 24 h post-infection, which corresponds to the time duration required for one full cycle of ASFV BA71V strain infection kinetics in Vero cells [23, 24]. First, we studied whether berbamine and tetrandrine may exhibit antiviral activity at lower compound concentrations. Vero cells infected with ASFV were treated with berbamine and tetrandrine at varying concentrations. The inhibitory effect of both compounds occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, B). Statistically significant antiviral activity (p < 0.05) was observed at the lowest concentrations of 12.5 µM for berbamine and 3.1 µM for tetrandrine. The IC50 value for berbamine was calculated to be 8.4 µM, while the IC50 value of tetrandrine was 2.2 µM. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV in Vero cells. (A) ASFV titer for cells exposed to berbamine at increasing concentrations from 3.1 µM to 50 µM. (B) ASFV titer for cells exposed to tetrandrine at increasing concentrations from 1.6 µM to 25 µM. (C) Western blot analysis of ASFV protein synthesis in ASFV-infected cells exposed to berbamine and tetrandrine at selected concentrations. Tubulin served as a loading control and cropping was done to show regions of interest. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on Vero cells infected with ASFV at different MOIs. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments in panel (C) were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01Dose-dependent antiviral effects were also observed when evaluating the synthesis of early (p30) and late (p72) ASFV proteins (Fig. 3C). Berbamine and tetrandrine significantly hampered the synthesis of p30 and p72 proteins at 50 µM and 25 µM concentrations, respectively, whereas the inhibitory effect was less pronounced at lower concentrations. Then, we studied the inhibitory effects of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV replication at different MOIs. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in viral yield following treatment with berbamine and tetrandrine at different MOIs, resulting in a decrease of approximately 1-1.1 log and 1.1–1.5 log, respectively (Fig. 3D). This result supports that the antiviral efficacy of these compounds is consistent regardless of the initial viral load infecting the cells. In our primary screen, we observed an ∼ 3 log reduction after treatment with 25 µM tetrandrine. However, during the single replication cycle experiments, we observed only a 1-log reduction. This difference led us to propose that tetrandrine can block ASFV replication in subsequent cycles. Indeed, the suppression of ASFV replication by berbamine and tetrandrine tended to be greater when the virus was collected at 72 h post-infection compared to 24- and 48-h post-infection (Fig. 4A). This finding indicates that both compounds exerted their antiviral effects across multiple rounds of virus replication. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Mechanistic analysis of antiviral activity by berbamine and tetrandrine. (A) Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine to inhibit ASFV in Vero cells depending on the virus replication duration, as indicated by supernatant collection time post-infection. (B) Effect of compound removal time on antiviral activity in Vero cells. Initially, virus and compound were added at the same time to cells and removal was done by media exchange. (C) Antiviral activity depending on the time of addition. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by Vero cells. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine in all experiments were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. nd refers to not determined (below detection limit). Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01As the greatest antiviral effect was observed at 72 h post-infection, we also studied the incubation duration required for 1-log (90% inhibition) reduction. For this purpose, berbamine and tetrandrine were added to ASFV-infected Vero cells at 0 h post-infection and removed by medium replacement after specific intervals. The virus was collected at 24 h post-infection and quantified. As expected, our results showed a gradual decrease in viral titers as the interval between infection and compound removal increased (Fig. 4B). Berbamine demonstrated a 1-log reduction in viral titer when ASFV-infected cells were exposed to this compound for 24 h. In contrast, tetrandrine achieved a similar level of viral titer reduction after 16 h of treatment. Next, we determined the specific replication stages of ASFV infection that are affected by berbamine and tetrandrine. Compounds were added at five time points before and after infection, followed by virus collection and titration at 24 h post-infection. The most significant antiviral effects of berbamine and tetrandrine were observed when cells were pre-treated with compound or co-treated with compound alongside ASFV infection (Fig. 4C). Berbamine reduced the viral yield from 3.98 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.25 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) when added at 0 h, in parallel to ASFV infection. Similarly, tetrandrine decreased the ASFV titer from 3.98 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.31 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) during co-addition. By contrast, there was no statistically significant antiviral effect on ASFV replication when berbamine and tetrandrine were added at 16 h post-infection. These results suggest that both compounds hamper ASFV replication by interfering with early stages of infection. Therefore, we further studied the effect of these compounds on the viral entry stage, which consists of virus attachment and internalization substages. To investigate the effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to Vero cells, compounds were added at 4 °C, in which condition virus particles bind to but do not enter cells. Treatment with berbamine and tetrandrine inhibited virus particle attachment to Vero cells, resulting in a decrease of the ASFV yield from 3.92 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 to 2.64 ± 0.09 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) and 2.47 ± 0.19 log TCID50 mL− 1 (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 4D). A more significant decrease was observed when compounds were added at the ASFV internalization stage. Berbamine and tetrandrine were added immediately after a temperature shift from 4 °C to 37 °C and removed after 1 h of treatment in order to minimize further antiviral effects on later stages of ASFV replication. Both compounds reduced the viral yield below the detection limit corresponding to < 2.2 log TCID50 mL− 1. Altogether, these results indicate that berbamine and tetrandrine inhibit ASFV infection by blocking virus entry.Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs Monocytes and macrophages are the main target cells for ASFV replication in pigs. Since ASFV has different entry mechanisms into Vero cells and PAMs [25], we studied the antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs as well. For these experiments, we used the highly virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate that is capable of infecting PAMs and causes disease in pigs [26, 27]. First, we incubated ASFV-infected PAMs with increasing concentrations of compounds that were not toxic to PAMs within the testing range (Additional file 1. Fig. S2). Both compounds decreased the viral titer in a dose-dependent manner and the corresponding IC50 values of berbamine and tetrandrine were 11.6 µM and 3.0 µM, respectively (Fig. 5A, B). Based on these initial results, we used the highest non-toxic concentrations (50 µM and 25 µM for berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively) in further time-of-addition and virus entry experiments. Time-of-addition experiments were conducted with the same five different time points before and after infection as in the case of the Vero cell experiments, and the results showed a similar pattern of inhibition (Fig. 5C). The most potent inhibitory effects were observed due to pre- and co-treatment of PAM cells with the compounds. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV Arm/07 isolate in PAM cells. ASFV titer in cells exposed to different concentrations of (A) berbamine (3.1–50 µM) or (B) tetrandrine (1.6–25 µM). (C) Antiviral activity depending on the time of addition. (D) Effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by PAM cells. The concentrations of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments in panels (C) and (D) were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01Then, we conducted experiments to reveal the effect of berbamine and tetrandrine on ASFV attachment to and internalization by PAMs. When berbamine and tetrandrine were added at the virus attachment substage, they decreased the ASFV yield from 5.03 ± 0.16 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 3.25 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01) and 2.92 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 5D). A more potent inhibitory effect was observed when the compounds were added at the internalization substage. Berbamine reduced the viral titer from 4.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 2.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1, while tetrandrine also blocked ASFV internalization, resulting in a virus titer decrease from 4.97 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1 to 2.25 ± 0.09 log HADU50 mL− 1. Based on these results, we conclude that berbamine and tetrandrine exerted significant inhibition of ASFV infection by disrupting the viral entry process. This inhibition was observed independently from the host cell type or ASFV strain used in our experiments.Anti-inflammatory activity of berbamine and tetrandrine in ASFV-infected PAMs As the natural compounds in the library were initially selected due to their anti-inflammatory properties, we also investigated the potential of berbamine and tetrandrine to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by ASFV-infected PAMs. While both compounds have generally recognized anti-inflammatory properties such as reducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages (see, e.g., Refs [28, 29]), their effects on curbing ASFV infection-related inflammation are unknown. As different immune-activating biological processes can involve various signaling pathways [30], it is thus important to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects in disease-specific contexts in terms of the etiological agent, cell type, and measured inflammation markers. Therefore, we quantified TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokine levels in PAM culture supernatants that were collected at 24- and 48-h post-infection using commercially available ELISA kits. Following a similar protocol, our experimental approach was first validated by measuring cytokine levels in uninfected PAMs incubated with LPS (1 µg mL− 1) with or without berbamine or tetrandrine (Additional file 1. Fig. S3). The results demonstrated that both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-1β production in LPS-treated PAMs at both time points as expected. Of note, tetrandrine also exhibited significant inhibition of IL-6 production, whereas the effect of berbamine on that cytokine was not statistically significant. We proceeded to test the anti-inflammatory properties of berbamine and tetrandrine in an ASFV-focused context by infecting PAMs with ASFV with or without berbamine or tetrandrine treatment before proceeding to measure cytokine production levels. In this format, the cytokine levels produced by PAMs increased following infection with the ASFV Arm/07 isolate, which is consistent with previously reported findings [31, 32]. In particular, the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels increased by around 18-, 11-, and 13-fold, respectively, at 24 h post-infection and by around 23-, 22-, and 21-fold, respectively, at 48 h post-infection compared to uninfected PAMs. Importantly, berbamine and tetrandrine treatment had strong effects on inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared to the levels found in untreated ASFV-infected cells. At 24 h post-infection, both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels compared to the ASFV control by around 60–80% (Fig. 6A-C). Notably, at 48 h post-infection, both berbamine and tetrandrine significantly reduced TNF-α levels by around 37% and 81% respectively, while the inhibitory effect of tetrandrine was greater (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6D). Both compounds also reduced IL-1β levels at 48 h post-infection by around 49% and 78%, respectively, and the results were statistically similar in this case (Fig. 6E). Importantly, only tetrandrine significantly reduced IL-6 levels at 48 h post-infection by around 62%, whereas the effect of berberine was insignificant (Fig. 6F). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in ASFV-infected PAMs. Effect of berbamine (Ber) or tetrandrine (Tet) on inhibition of (A) TNF-α, (B) IL-1β, and (C) IL-6 production in ASFV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection. (D-F) Corresponding measurements at 48 h post-infection. Cytokine measurements were performed by ELISA on collected supernatants. The concentration of berbamine and tetrandrine for the experiments were 50 µM and 25 µM, respectively. ASFV means virus-only control without compound addition while Ber and Tet denote berbamine and tetrandrine, respectively. Results represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments (n = 3). Significant differences compared to other test groups are denoted by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001Thus, both compounds displayed anti-inflammatory activity in ASFV-infected PAMs while tetrandrine demonstrated a superior activity profile in terms of greater inhibitory levels and more sustained effect throughout the course of infection. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that both compounds, especially tetrandrine with its high effectiveness, possess the ability to not only impede ASFV replication but also to mitigate ASFV-induced production of clinically important pro-inflammatory cytokines.Discussion ASFV remains a significant threat to the global swine industry and is characterized by its devastating impact on pig populations and the absence of approved vaccines or specific antiviral therapies [33]. The absence of preventive measures against ASFV highlights the critical need to discover effective interventions to control and manage this highly contagious disease in pigs. Within this context, the exploration of natural compounds with potential antiviral properties has gained immense importance and highlights the opportunity to identify novel inhibitory strategies to combat ASFV infection [9]. In this work, the screening of a library of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties led to the identification of five promising candidates—paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine—that showed substantial inhibition of ASFV-induced CPE without affecting cell monolayers. These compounds belong to distinct classes, with berbamine and tetrandrine exhibiting more complex chemical structures compared to the other lead candidates. Subsequent validation experiments in Vero cells confirmed the antiviral efficacy of these compounds against ASFV replication. Tetrandrine displayed the most potent effect, achieving a 3.6 log reduction in viral titer, while paeonol and pinoresinol exhibited weaker inhibitory effects. Notably, none of these five compounds demonstrated virucidal activity or cytotoxic effects at tested concentrations, confirming the specificity of their antiviral activities. Recently, Zhu et al. and Qian et al. independently reported the antiviral activity of berbamine and tetrandrine against ASFV in vitro [34, 35], thereby additionally validating the robustness of our screening results. In the present context, further mechanistic investigations focused on berbamine and tetrandrine revealed their dose-dependent antiviral activities, inhibiting the synthesis of ASFV proteins and consistently reducing viral yields across different MOIs. Time-of-addition experiments elucidated the compounds’ action points within the viral replication cycle, highlighting their significant impact during pre- and co-treatment phases. Berbamine and tetrandrine significantly inhibited ASFV replication by interfering with early infection stages, particularly virus attachment and internalization into host cells, that in turn disrupted viral entry. Interestingly, both compounds exhibited sustained antiviral effects over multiple replication cycles (cf. Figure 4A). This finding fits with the relatively long half-lives that have been reported for both compounds [36], which supports their capability to impact ASFV replication over several cycles. Given that both compounds also exhibited antiviral activity during early stages of viral infection post-internalization in the present experiments (cf. Figure 4C), it is reasonable that the most significant antiviral effect was observed during the prolonged presence of compounds in the cell culture medium (cf. Figure 4B) and the results are consistent with their effects on virus replication at various stages, especially viral entry. Furthermore, extending the study to primary target cells, porcine macrophages, revealed consistent antiviral effects of berbamine and tetrandrine. Notably, these compounds inhibited ASFV infection by disrupting viral entry mechanisms, suggesting that their antiviral mechanism is irrespective of host cell type or virus strain. It has been reported that tetrandrine inhibits Ebola virus entry into human monocyte-derived macrophages by disrupting endosomal Ca2+ channels [37]. In addition, berbamine suppresses the replication of Japanese encephalitis virus by blocking Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channels in endosomes [38]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that comparable inhibitory mechanisms might play a role in exerting antiviral effects against ASFV. Conducting further experiments could potentially unveil the involvement of endosomal Ca2+ channels in ASFV infection in future work. Importantly, we also demonstrated that berbamine and tetrandrine effectively reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in ASFV-infected macrophages, which had not been explored before. Among these cytokines, TNF-α is considered to play an essential role in driving pathological changes observed in ASFV-infected pigs [13, 39]. Therefore, compounds such as berbamine and tetrandrine can not only suppress viral replication but also demonstrate the capability to mitigate pathological conditions associated with the heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to viral infection. Of note, tetrandrine exhibited a particularly high and sustained level of anti-inflammatory activity in the ASFV infection context and, together with its high antiviral activity, supports that it has promising merits. These findings are particularly significant because berbamine and tetrandrine, along with other bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, have also been recently reported to inhibit porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with similar potency [40, 41], suggesting their broad utility as porcine virus countermeasures. At the same time, previous studies have focused on validating the antiviral activity of these compounds and did not evaluate potential infection-related anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings expand on this viewpoint and demonstrate proof-of-principle to show that the anti-inflammatory properties of berbamine and tetrandrine are translatable to inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during viral infection along with reducing viral load.Conclusions In conclusion, our results indicate that berbamine and tetrandrine possess dual inhibitory activities: potent antiviral activity against ASFV, primarily through disrupting viral entry mechanisms; and significant inhibition of virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, these compounds hold promise as potential preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection, with tetrandrine exhibiting particularly robust antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties that warrant further investigation and development.Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. 12985_2024_2374_MOESM1_ESM.docx (804.1KB, docx) Additional file 1: Fig. S1.
