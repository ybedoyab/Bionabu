    "abstract": "Abstract The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Infections with nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars are a leading cause of bacterial enteric disease and are the single most common cause of death from food-borne illnesses in the United States [1]. An essential feature of the pathogenicity of Salmonella is its interaction with host intestinal epithelial cells, where Salmonella invasion/entry into host cells is critical for bacterial survival and establishment of disease in a host. Currently, it is thought that Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells requires the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS), a Gram negative bacterial “molecular syringe” that injects effector proteins into the host cell cytosol, thus altering cellular functions [2], [3], [4]. Salmonella possesses two T3SSs that direct the secretion of proteins into host cells, and a third T3SS that directs the secretion of proteins to be assembled into the external flagellular organelle [5], [6]. The T3SS considered to be necessary for epithelial cell invasion is encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), a large region of the Salmonella genome that contains numerous genes involved in pathogenesis and infection [6], [7], [8], [9]. The second T3SS is encoded on a second pathogenicity island, SPI-2, which is induced after Salmonella invasion of host cells and secretes protein effectors necessary for intracellular bacterial trafficking and replication [10], [11]. The third T3SS is under the transcriptional control of the flhDC operon, the master regulator of the flagellum assembly machinery [5], [12], [13], [14]. A significant portion of our knowledge regarding Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella) T3SSs and their role in infection of epithelial cells has been derived from studies that utilized non-polarized monolayer cell culture systems [6], [10], [15]. However, during in vivo infections, Salmonella infects polarized epithelial cells of the host intestinal tract [16]. In recognition that conventional monolayer cell culture models do not display the structure, morphology, and architecture of the intestinal tract, more advanced and in vivo-like model systems have been developed and implemented to study Salmonella pathogenesis, which include polarized intestinal cell culture models, ileal loop models, C. elegans model, and mouse, cattle, and chick animal models [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Studies utilizing these more complex model systems demonstrated that SPI-1 was critical in the establishment of a Salmonella infection. While these model systems have certainly unveiled critical insight into the lifecycle and pathogenic mechanisms of Salmonella, the majority of these studies have utilized non-human model systems to predict what potentially could be occurring during infection of humans. Moreover, it was shown that the severity and role of SPI-1 and 2 to cause infection by Salmonella Typhimurium depends on the host species, which further complicates data extrapolation to the human condition [21], [23], [27]. The importance of host species in investigating and understanding the mechanisms of Salmonella-induced gastrointestinal disease was further demonstrated in a recent key study looking at a naturally occurring Salmonella outbreak in humans, which revealed conflicting results as compared to monolayers and non-human animal models [28]. Specifically, the study identified two clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg present in stool samples from a food-borne human disease outbreak that lacked essential SPI-1 T3SS structural components and SPI-1 encoded secreted effectors [28]. Infection of mice with these isolated strains displayed little to no intestinal pathology or inflammation, suggesting these bacterial strains are limited to cause only human enteropathology. Furthermore, these naturally occurring SPI-1 deficient strains invaded human monolayer cells less efficiently than laboratory constructed SPI-1 mutants, further demonstrating differences between monolayer systems and in vivo outcomes of infection. Collectively, these studies demonstrate how different Salmonella infection model systems can give conflicting results, with the most dependable and accurate model being the natural host. Unfortunately, a human Salmonella infection model is unrealistic and impractical, in turn the next best model system would be one that best approximates the parental tissue in vivo. To achieve an in vitro cell culture model that more closely mimics in vivo cellular characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, multicellular complexity, mucus production, apical/basolateral polarity, and well developed tight junction formation [29], our laboratory utilizes the Rotating-Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor system (Figure 1). The gentle fluid rotation of the RWV creates a physiological low fluid shear environment that allows the cells to grow in three-dimensions, aggregate based on natural cellular affinities, and differentiate into human surrogate tissue-like models possessing in vivo characteristics not observed in the same cells grown as monolayers [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. In this study we use a RWV-generated organotypic 3-D model derived from the colon epithelial cell line, HT-29. HT-29 cells were chosen as the model cell line in this study because a) they have been extensively characterized in 3-D and shown to be a physiologically relevant model of the parental tissue from which they were derived [32], b) they represent the primary site of Salmonella intestinal infection [37], c) we have previously applied this system to model fundamental aspects of the host-pathogen interactions with Salmonella [32], and d) numerous studies have been conducted using this cell line grown as monolayers to study the initial stages of the host-pathogen interaction between Salmonella and intestinal epithelium that lead to gastrointestinal disease [18], [32], [38]. Figure 1. Depiction and operation of the RWV cell culture system. Open in a new tab A) Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor containing cell culture media and porous microcarrier beads. B) Sedimentation of cells within the RWV is offset by the rotating fluid, creating a constant free fall of the cells through the culture medium, allowing the cells to form 3-D aggregates under conditions of physiological fluid shear. Three-dimensional aggregates are taken out of the bioreactor for analysis including light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (i), or seeded evenly in a 24 well plate format for various profiling and infection assays (ii). C) Enlarged representation of intestinal epithelial cells attached to microcarrier beads of a 3-D aggregate. After intestinal epithelial cells adhere to the beads, they begin to differentiate and display in vivo-like characteristics such as narrow columnar cellular morphology, basement membrane, tight junctions, mucus, and microvilli [31], [32], [36]. D) A further enlarged depiction of a single bead within the 3-D aggregate displaying characterized cellular surface structures and components, and infected with Salmonella. In this work, we demonstrate several key aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis during infection of RWV-derived 3-D organotypic models of human colonic epithelium that mimic in vivo observations, but contradict prevailing paradigms established using monolayers and many non-human model systems. We report for the first time that Salmonella is able to invade 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known Salmonella T3SSs, including SPI-1 and SPI-2 encoded T3SSs and the flagellar secretory system regulated by the flhDC operon [13]. Within the 3-D intestinal epithelial aggregates, we were able to identify three different epithelial cell types that are present in the human large intestine, further showing the complexity and physiological relevance of the 3-D intestinal model. Unlike previous in vitro reports, there was no identifiable preferential host cell type targeted in our 3-D intestinal models during infection by wildtype or the T3SS Salmonella mutants [39], [40], [41], [42]. Non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial-size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not appear to be localized intracellularly in 3-D intestinal cells, demonstrating that an active bacterial invasion mechanism(s) is necessary for internalization, rather than a non-specific host cellular uptake mechanism. Following invasion of 3-D cells, the SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2 double mutant, and the SPI-1/2 flhDC triple T3SS mutant, all grew to similar levels intracellularly, but to substantially lower levels than wildtype Salmonella. Collectively, we provide evidence that our highly differentiated 3-D models of human colonic epithelium exhibit infection phenotypes that are consistent with an in vivo enteric Salmonella infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report that bacterial invasion, but not intracellular growth, is largely independent of the functions encoded by TTSSs.",
    "methods": "Materials And Methods Mammalian Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table S1. All bacterial strains were grown in Lennox broth (L broth) as described below [82]. The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) [32], [83], [84]. The cells were cultured in a specialized growth medium comprised of a triple-sugar minimal essential medium α–L-15 base supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, designated as GTSF-2 [85], and incubated at 37°C at 5% CO2 environment. Antibodies and Reagents Antibodies against specified antigens were obtained from the following sources: Sialyl Lewis A (MC-551; Kamiya), polyclonal Salmonella O antisera (BD Difco), monoclonal Salmonella antibody (MAI-83451; Affinity Bioreagents), syndecan-1 (MCA681T; AbD seroTec), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (ab58375; Abcam), ITF goblet cell marker (15C6; Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (A22284; Invitrogen). Fluoresbrite plain YG 2.00 micron microspheres (fluorescent beads) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (18338). For mammalian cell viability, 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) was used at a 1∶1 ratio with cells suspended in cell culture media. Growth of 3-D intestinal cells in the RWV The development of 3-D intestinal tissue models was performed as previously described [31], [32]. In brief, HT-29 epithelial cells were initially grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2×106 cells/ml. Cells were then introduced into RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Inc.) together with collagen-coated Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Pharmacia), resulting in a final ratio of ∼10 cells/bead [85]. Cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactors in GTSF-2 at 37°C and 5% CO2 with rotation at 20 rpm. Fresh medium was replenished after 5 days and then every 24 hours thereafter until harvest of the cultures at 18-23 days. Bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays HT-29 monolayers were grown in GTSF-2 medium in a 24-well plate at a concentration of ∼1.2 million cells/plate. For 3-D aggregates, cells were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of ∼19 million cells/plate. For infections, all bacterial strains were grown shaking overnight in L broth medium at 37°C. Bacteria were back-diluted 1∶200 and grown with aeration until the bacterial growth reached OD 600 of ∼0.8. Bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and used to infect mammalian cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h, whereupon infected cells were washed three times with D-PBS and incubated in medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin for 3 hour. The cells were then washed three times with D-PBS and fresh medium containing 7.5 µg/ml gentamicin was added. At indicated times post-infection (p.i.), media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 500 µl of 0.1% Triton-X 100, and a fraction of the lysate was plated on L agar to enumerate colony-forming units (CFU). For heat killed Salmonella studies, bacteria were taken from the back diluted Salmonella cultures, washed 3 times with D-PBS, resuspended in D-PBS, heated at 90°C for 30 minutes, and used to infect mammalian cells as with live Salmonella. Confocal Microscopy The 3-D aggregates were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded in a 24 well plate at a concentration of approximately 19 million cells/plate. Infections were done either using same protocol as invasion/intracellular growth assays described above, or an established protocol described by Mortimer et al., which allows for a shorter and synchronized infection [56]. In brief, Salmonella overnight cultures grown in LB shaking at 37°C were back diluted 1∶200 in LB and grown shaking until they reached an OD of ∼1.2. Bacteria were washed 2 times in D-PBS and used to infect mammalian cells at an m.o.i. of 10 for 5 minutes, whereupon host cells washed 3 times and media was replaced with media containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin. At indicated times p.i., 3-D aggregates were fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in D-PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. For staining, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (D-PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA). Blocking buffer with primary antibody (concentration antibody dependent) was added to the cells for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then rinsed three times with D-PBS and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody diluted 1∶1000 in blocking buffer. Aggregates were rinsed with D-PBS and mounted with Pro-Long Gold Anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with the Carl Zeiss 510 Inverted confocal microscope using a 100× objective and ZEN Light Edition 2009 software. Quantitation of Salmonella colocalization with the various host markers was determined by fixing cells at indicated times p.i., staining the cells with the designated host and Salmonella specific antibodies, then counting the number of bacteria that localized with the markers per 35-50 bacteria in at least three independent experiments. For differential immunofluorescence staining of extracellular and intracellular bacteria, infections were carried out as described above in the bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays section and staining was done as described in results section and in published reports [46]. Statistical analysis Data sets in triplicate were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software to calculate the Student's unpaired t-test for independent samples. P-values of <0.05 (*) and <0.001 (**) were considered significant and highly significant, respectively.",
    "results": "Results Salmonella invades 3-D intestinal cells in the absence of SPI-1, SPI-2, and flagellum T3SSs and their effector proteins In previous reports from our lab utilizing classic gentamicin invasion assays, we showed that a Salmonella invA mutant that is defective for invading monolayers, exhibited wildtype levels of invasion into 3-D HT-29 colon cells [32], [43]. InvA is encoded by SPI-1 and is essential in the formation of the T3SS needle. However, SPI-1 encodes for numerous other genes aside from invA that are involved in bacterial invasion and virulence [2]. To investigate if alternative SPI-1 encoded effector protein(s) are potentially responsible for Salmonella invasion into 3-D intestinal cells, we infected HT-29 monolayers and 3-D aggregates with either a Salmonella mutant lacking the invA gene or a mutant lacking the entire SPI-1 encoding region (Figure 2A). The invA mutant and the SPI-1 mutant both invaded 3-D HT-29 cells to higher levels compared to monolayers. These data suggest that SPI-1, a virulence factor previously identified to be required for Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells grown as monolayers [9], [44], is not mandatory for invasion into our well-differentiated 3-D intestinal epithelial cells. Figure 2. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system are not required for Salmonella invasion into 3-D intestinal cells. Open in a new tab A) HT-29 monolayers (black bars) and 3-D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, ΔinvA, ΔSPI-1, ΔSPI-2, and ΔSPI-1/2 Salmonella mutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. B) Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected as in (A), fixed at 3 hpi, stained with a Salmonella monoclonal antibody (extracellular bacteria), washed, permeabilized, stained with a Salmonella polyclonal antibody (extracellular and intracellular bacteria), and imaged by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Percentages represent number of bacteria out of ∼50 bacteria that stained with the monoclonal antibody pre-permeabilization (grey bars) or the remaining bacteria that stained with the polyclonal antibody and not the monoclonal antibody post-permeabilization (black bars). C) Representative single image from z-stack confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100× objective) of 3-D HT-29 aggregates exposed to red fluorescent beads (2 µm) for 1 hour, washed, fixed 3 hours post exposure, and stained with phalloidin antibody to visualize host cell actin (green). D) HT-29 monolayers (black bars) and 3-D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype Salmonella, ΔSPI-1/2 Salmonella, E. coli, and B. subtilis for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10.

E) HT-29 monolayers (black bars) and 3-D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, ΔSPI-1/2, ΔflhDC, ΔSPI-1/2: flhDC Salmonella mutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. Data represents the average of at least three independent experiments from separate batches of cells (N = 3). Limit of detection is 10 CFU. * and ** indicate statistical significance of p<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 3-D aggregates to monolayers for each bacterial strain.We next wanted to test the hypothesis that the second T3SS encoded by SPI-2 and/or its encoded effectors were potentially compensating for the loss of SPI-1, thereby aiding in the invasion of Salmonella into the 3-D cells. To address this question, we infected HT-29 monolayers and 3-D cells with a SPI-2 deletion mutant and a SPI-1/SPI-2 double mutant (Figure 2A). The double mutant was still able to invade 3-D cells to significantly higher levels compared to monolayers, and to similar levels observed for SPI-1 and SPI-2 mutants in 3-D cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that unlike monolayers, Salmonella can invade the more in vivo-like 3-D cells in the absence of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs and their encoded effectors. However, the SPI-1 and SPI-2 genomic regions do contribute to a more productive invasion, as wildtype Salmonella exhibited significantly higher levels of invasion compared to the T3SS mutants in 3-D cells. Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were previously shown to secrete mucus, which could cause bacteria to adhere to the surface of the cells and not actually be localized intracellularly [32]. Thus, to further validate that wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant are indeed localized inside 3-D HT-29 cells, we performed a differential immunofluorescence microscopy staining technique that allows one to distinguish between extra- and intracellular bacteria [45], [46]. Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected with wildtype and Salmonella SPI-1 and SPI-1/2 mutants as in (A), fixed, and stained with a monoclonal anti-Salmonella antibody that will bind only extracellular bacteria. After addition of corresponding secondary antibody, cells were washed, permeabilized, and stained with a polyclonal Salmonella antibody that can bind to intracellular and extracellular bacteria as a result of host cell membrane permeabilization (Figure S1). Three-dimensional cells were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and the bacteria that only stained with the monoclonal antibody (pre-permeabilization/extracellular bacteria) were counted out of 50 total bacteria (stained with both antibodies) in at least three independent experiments (Figure 2B). A majority of the wildtype and Salmonella T3SS mutants were localized intracellularly (>60% of total bacteria counted), and no significant difference in bacterial localization was observed between wildtype and T3SS mutants, further demonstrating that Salmonella can invade into 3-D HT-29 cells in the absence of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs. As shown, Salmonella SPI-1 and 2 T3SSs mutants can invade 3-D HT-29 cells; however, we wanted to investigate if Salmonella was entering 3-D HT-29 cells through non-specific cellular uptake and not a Salmonella active invasion mechanism. To test if 3-D cells are capable of particle uptake, we introduced bacterial sized fluorescent beads to the cells under the identical experimental conditions used for our Salmonella infection assays. Three hours post bead exposure; cells were fixed, stained with phalloidin to visualize host cell actin cytoskeleton, and imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2C). The only beads observed were those that appeared to be extracellular in localization. The extracellular localization was further confirmed by z-stack confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure S2). Next we wanted to investigate if bacterial surface component(s) and/or bacterial active process(s) are required to be present for cellular uptake. We thus infected 3D HT-29 cells with non-invasive Gram negative E. coli and Gram positive B. subtilis strains, which represent bacteria that have very different surface structures and do not posses mechanisms necessary for host cell invasion. Three hours post infection, we observed no intracellular bacteria by gentamicin survival assay or confocal microscopy (Figure 2D and data not shown). These data suggest that either an invasion mechanism is necessary for internalization, or alternatively, a Salmonella specific surface component/structure is triggering Salmonella internalization by 3-D HT-29 cells. To determine between these two possibilities, monolayer and 3-D HT-29 cells were infected with heat-killed wildtype Salmonella for 1 hour, washed, and fixed. Cells were stained with anti-Salmonella antibody, phalloidin, and DAPI to visualize host and bacterial nuclei, and visualized by confocal microscopy using z-stack imaging. We observed no intracellular Salmonella in either monolayer or 3-D HT-29 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that Salmonella is actively invading 3-D HT-29 cells utilizing a mechanism(s) other than the SPI-1 or 2 encoded T3SSs. Another possible means of Salmonella protein effector secretion that could potentiate invasion and allow Salmonella active entry into 3-D cells is through a pore created in the bacterial membrane as a result of flagellum translocation to the surface, which occurs through a third T3SS [47], [48]. To test the hypothesis that secreted effector(s) responsible for invasion of the Salmonella SPI-1/2 double mutant into 3-D cells is a result of the flagellum pore; we infected cells with a Salmonella mutant deficient in SPI-1, SPI-2, and the master regulators of flagellum pore formation and synthesis, FlhC and FlhD (Figure 2E). The SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC mutant was still able to significantly invade the 3-D HT-29 aggregates, demonstrating that Salmonella can actively invade 3-D intestinal cells in the absence of all known/characterized T3SSs. Salmonella does not preferentially target M-cells/M-like cells in 3-D HT-29 models The work presented here is the first to report that all known T3SSs are not mandatory for Salmonella invasion into epithelial cells, which is consistent with reports of SPI-1 deficient strains being isolated from humans with enteric salmonellosis and animal intestinal tissues [28], [49]. Moreover, a Salmonella SPI-1 mutant has also been shown to preferentially target and invade mouse epithelial M cells and polarized epithelial cells cultured under conditions that allow them to express M-cell like phenotypes, phenotypes that include particle uptake and transportation of antigens [16], [39], [41], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. From these studies, we hypothesized that Salmonella and the T3SS mutants are targeting M-cells to eventually gain entry into the 3-D aggregates. To first observe if the aggregates contained M-cells or M-cell like cells, we stained uninfected 3-D HT-29 cells with anti-sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M-cell marker) and imaged the cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the 3-D aggregates exhibited very similar staining and expression patterns of the M-cell marker as observed in normal human colon tissue sections [55]. Specifically, the 3-D cells displayed a columnar morphology to where only the edges of >20% of the cells showed expression of the M-cell marker. We next wanted to observe if wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant preferentially targeted M-cells/M-like cells present in the 3-D aggregates to eventually gain intracellular localization (Figure 3A). Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected with either wildtype or the Salmonella SPI-1 mutant for ∼5 minutes at an m.o.i. of 10∶1 according to the infection protocol outlined by Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999 [56]. This established protocol allows for a shorter infection time, a more synchronized infection, and earlier cellular fixation periods, while maintaining the same Salmonella intracellular growth and trafficking profiles observed with longer and more commonly used infection protocols (Figure S3A-C) [56]. Wildtype Salmonella SPI-1 induction during the different growth conditions utilized in these studies was also analyzed, and no observable or significant differences in SPI-1 expression was seen by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively (Figure S3D, Text S1, and data not shown). After infection, cells were fixed 5–10 mpi to capture the early stages of infection, and stained with anti-sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M-cell marker), anti-Salmonella antibody, and DAPI to visualize nuclei (Figures 3A, S4, and S5) [55]. Quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of wildtype and SPI-1 mutant bacteria out of 50 bacteria in at least 3 independent experiments that localized to cells expressing M-cell marker revealed only 20–25% of wildtype and SPI-1 mutant localized to M-cells/M-like cells, and similar levels were also observed with the wildtype, SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/2: flhDC strains (Figure 3B). These data suggest that there is no preferential targeting of wildtype Salmonella and the T3SS mutants to M-cells/M-like cells within the 3-D aggregates. Figure 3. Internalization of wildtype or T3SS mutants into 3-D intestinal cells is not exclusively dependent on M-cells/M-like cells. Open in a new tab A) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100× objective) of 3-D HT-29 aggregates left uninfected or infected for 5–10 min with either the wildtype or SPI-1 Salmonella mutant and stained with anti-sialyl Lewis A (M-cell marker) antibody (red), anti-Salmonella antibody (green), and DAPI (blue). B) Quantitation of confocal images as observed in (A) of 3-D HT-29 aggregates infected for 5–10 min with wildtype and the T3SS mutants. Percentages represent the number of bacteria localized to M-cell marker/∼50 bacteria counted (N≥3). No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker. C) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100× objective) of 3-D HT-29 aggregates infected with a Salmonella type 1 pili mutant (ΔfimA-H) and stained with anti-sialyl Lewis A antibody (red), anti-Salmonella antibody (green), and DAPI (blue). D) HT-29 3-D aggregates infected with wildtype, ΔfimH, and ΔfimA-H Salmonella mutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium (N≥3).As shown in Figure 3B, Salmonella T3SSs are not needed for localization to 3-D HT-29 M-cells/M-like cells, however recent reports suggest that FimH, a component of type I pili, interacts with an M-cell surface protein and this interaction is necessary for Salmonella intestinal invasion specifically into M-cells [42], [57]. To determine if the type I pili is playing a role in Salmonella targeting and internalization into 3-D aggregates, and more specifically M-cells, we infected 3-D HT-29 cells with a type I pili mutant (ΔFimA-H). Consistent with reports that type I pili is needed to bind to M-cells in order to invade these cell types; we observed no co-localization of Salmonella pili mutant with the M-cell marker at 5-10 mpi by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 3C). However, both the mutant lacking entire pili (ΔfimA-H) and the mutant lacking just the adhesion portion of the pili (ΔfimH), were still able to invade 3-D cells to similar levels as wildtype (Figure 3D). Utilization of the Fim mutants is also functioning as a control for bacteria that cannot interact with M-cells, but can still invade our 3-D aggregates, demonstrating that Salmonella entry into 3-D cells is not solely dependent upon interactions with M-cell/M-like cells. Salmonella T3SS mutants target multiple intestinal epithelial cell types within 3-D aggregates The large intestine, from which HT-29 cells are derived, is composed of multiple epithelial cell types, and we used confocal microscopy to assess if any of these cell types are present in our 3-D aggregates and if Salmonella is targeting these cell types during infection [58]. We identified two other cell types in addition to M-cells/M-like cells using immunofluorescence labeling, enterocytes and Paneth cells (Figures 4 A and C). Since enterocytes make up the majority of cells within the intestine and also have known absorptive properties, we predicted that a significant proportion of Salmonella not localized to M-cells/M-like cells could be targeting enterocytes [59]. After dual staining of 3-D HT-29 cells with the M-cell marker (sialyl Lewis A) and enterocyte marker (syndecan-1) antibodies, we observed very little overlap of cells expressing both markers, demonstrating two different cellular populations within the aggregates (Figure S6) [54], [55], [60], [61]. Three-dimensional cells were infected with either wildtype or SPI-1 Salmonella mutant, fixed 5 mpi, stained with both enterocyte and Salmonella specific antibodies, and the number of bacteria out of ∼50 bacteria localized to the enterocyte marker was quantitated by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 4B). A majority of bacteria localized to cells expressing the enterocyte marker, with no significant difference in localization between wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant, suggesting that the SPI-1 encoded T3SS does not play a role in host cell type targeting in the intestinal epithelium during infection.

Percentages represent the number of bacteria localized to markers/∼50 bacteria from three different experiments and independent batches of 3-D HT-29 cells. No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker (N = 3).The third cell type we identified in the 3-D HT-29 aggregates were Paneth cells, a cell type known to secrete antimicrobials, including defensins, with no detectable absorptive properties [62], [63], [64], [65] (Figure 4C). After 3-D HT-29 infection with the wildtype or SPI-1 mutant, and quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of bacteria out of ∼50 bacteria that localized to cells expressing the Paneth cell marker (Phospholipase A2) [66], we observed <10% of bacteria localized to cells expressing this marker (Figure 4D). Consistent with previous reports of diseased colon tissue samples, we noted an increase in Paneth cell marker expression upon infection (Figure 4C and D) [64], [65]. Goblet cells are a known fourth cell type within the intestine. While our 3-D HT-29 cells did exhibit mucus production (a hallmark of goblet cells), we were unable to definitively identify goblet cells in the 3-D HT-29 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using a goblet cell marker antibody [32], [67]. The Salmonella SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/2: flhDC mutants were also profiled for host cell type localization within the 3-D HT-29 aggregates, and similar localization profiles with no significant difference in marker localization of these mutants were observed as compared to wildtype Salmonella (Figure 4E). Collectively, these data suggest that Salmonella T3SSs do not influence the active targeting of the bacteria to a specific cell type in the 3-D intestinal cells during infection. Salmonella T3SSs are required for substantial intracellular growth in 3-D HT-29 cells Our data established that Salmonella T3SSs are not required for invasion into 3-D HT-29 cells; however we were interested in observing the intracellular growth profiles of the T3SS mutants after entry into 3-D cells and their profiles compared to monolayers (Figure 5). We thus infected monolayers and 3-D HT-29 cells with the various bacterial strains at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour. At the indicated times post infection, host cells were lysed and bacteria were enumerated for colony forming units. Wildtype Salmonella and the SPI-2 mutant had similar growth profiles between monolayers and 3-D cells with an increase in growth by 24 hpi compared to 3 hpi. The SPI-1, SPI-1/2, flhDC, and SPI-1/2: flhDC mutants had little to no detectable growth by 24 hpi in monolayers; however, these mutants grew to levels similar as the SPI-2 mutant in 3-D cells, although the mutant strains never reached wildtype growth levels. The non-invasive Gram negative E. coli and Gram positive B. subtilis were also used as controls to infect 3-D cells; however neither bacterium had detectable intracellular growth by 24 hpi, further suggesting that a bacterial specific active invasion mechanism is necessary for bacterial internalization into 3-D cells. These growth curves also demonstrate the ability of the Salmonella mutants to invade and survive within 3-D cells for 24 hours, as they are not killed by the gentamicin in the extracellular media as observed with E. coli and B. subtilis (Figure 2D and Figure 5B). From these data, we conclude that SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretion system are not necessary for invasion into 3-D HT-29 cells, but are required for wildtype levels of invasion and intracellular replication.

    "discussion": "Discussion In previous work, we established and characterized a 3-D organotypic model of human large intestinal epithelium from the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 utilizing the cellular suspension RWV bioreactor system [32], [36]. HT-29 cells grown in three-dimensions in the RWV displayed numerous characteristics relevant to their in vivo tissue counterparts, demonstrating the potential of utilizing RWV-derived 3-D cells as surrogate models to elucidate cellular mechanisms and responses to conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract, such as during an enteric pathogen infection [32], [36]. We previously reported that an invA Salmonella mutant (which is defective for invasion of monolayers) invaded into 3-D HT-29 cells to similar levels as wildtype, and to our knowledge, this was the first report to suggest that the SPI-T3SS may not be the main determinant for invasion of Salmonella into in vitro models of human intestinal epithelium [32], [43]. While intriguing, our previous findings did not definitively preclude a role for the SPI-1 T3SS in intestinal invasion, nor did we apply the 3-D large intestinal model to investigate the role of the two other T3SSs in Salmonella, the SPI-2 encoded T3SS and the flhDC regulated flagellum secretory system. In this report, we fundamentally expanded our studies to show that the 3-D model of large intestinal epithelium displays multicellular complexity relevant to the normal parental tissue in vivo, including formation of M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes and Paneth cells. We subsequently applied these highly differentiated 3-D intestinal cultures as human surrogate infection models to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella T3SSs in the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis. Specifically, we infected 3-D HT-29 and monolayer cells with various Salmonella mutants carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and a complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC), respectively. We observed substantial differences in the roles of the T3SSs during invasion into and growth within the 3-D HT-29 cells as compared to monolayers, but notably, we identified similar key phenotypic responses between the 3-D cells following Salmonella challenge with those reported during the in vivo infection process. The initial key difference that we observed in response to infection between 3-D large intestinal cells and established data utilizing monolayers, was the significant increase in invasion of a SPI-1 encoded T3SS mutant into the 3-D cells (Figure 2A and B), a mutant previously characterized to be invasion defective in monolayers [43], [44]. The SPI-1 mutant lacking the entire SPI-1 coding region displayed lower levels of invasion compared to the invA T3SS mutant in both culture systems, and this could be a result of the absence of the entire SPI-1 PAI (Pathogenicity Island) in the SPI-1 mutant, which could potentially contain effectors aiding in bacterial invasion. Surprisingly, a SPI-1/2 double mutant and a SPI-1/2: flhDC triple mutant, a strain lacking all characterized T3SS secretion systems, also invaded into the 3-D intestinal cells at similar levels (Figure 2E). While the TTSS mutants were able to invade 3-D cells, the invasion levels were significantly lower compared to wildtype. These data suggest that TTSSs contribute to a more productive bacterial invasion of 3-D cells, but an unidentified bacterial factor(s) is contributing to majority of Salmonella invasion into 3-D cells. We are currently attempting to identify the bacterial and/or host factors that are the major regulators of invasion for Salmonella into human 3-D intestinal cells. However, once intracellular, each single, double and triple T3SS mutant was unable to grow to levels similar to that of wildtype (Figure 5B), suggesting that each T3SS system is necessary for successful replication of Salmonella inside 3-D intestinal cells. Interestingly, even though the SPI-1 mutant still contains the SPI-2 system and its encoded effectors predicted to be responsible for intracellular survival, the SPI-1 mutant did not replicate as well as wildtype once inside the host cells. These data are consistent with work utilizing monolayers showing that a Salmonella invA mutant was unable to grow after induced invasion of epithelial cells [68]. We are currently characterizing the role of SPI-2 and its secreted effectors in Salmonella intracellular trafficking and replication within our 3-D intestinal models. Until recently, the paradigm for Salmonella entry into human intestinal epithelial cells was based upon results from monolayer cell cultures and non-human animal models [6], [10], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [26], [27]; however our work with highly differentiated 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells cultivated in the RWV bioreactor demonstrated infection phenotypes more closely related to those observed in vivo [28], [31], [32], [36], [49]. The RWV bioreactor system is only one example of how advancements in technology facilitate the improvement of tissue engineered model systems to more accurately mimic in vivo conditions in the native host, thus allowing researchers to study host-pathogen interactions in an accessible, reproducible, and tractable in vitro system [22], [23], [24], [26], [36], [39]. However, as previously discussed, choice of host species has been shown to greatly influence the outcome of a Salmonella infection, and several studies utilizing a variety of advanced model systems have shown that T3SSs are necessary for Salmonella invasion and infection of these models [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [26], [39]. Recently however, non-human models studying Salmonella pathogenesis are in agreement with our findings reported in this study, that SPI-1 is not critical for the invasion of host cells. One such example was conducted by Coombes et al., 2005, wherein this group utilized a novel explant/re-implantation calf ileal loop model to investigate the role of SPI-1 and SPI-2 during the later stages of a Salmonella infection [69]. Interestingly, the SPI-1 Salmonella mutant not only infected the tissues of the small intestine, but by 5 days post infection, severe inflammation, submucosal edema, necrosis, vascular thrombosis, and villus atrophy had also occurred. In a separate study, Desin et al., 2009, observed colonization of a Salmonella enterica subsup. Enterica serovar Enteritidis strain lacking SPI-1 in the cecum of chickens [70]. In a similar example, the fowl-adapted Salmonella strain, Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum, was also able to invade animal cells independently of SPI-1 [71]. Moreover, a Salmonella Typhimurium SPI-1 mutant was recovered at comparable levels to the wildtype strain from the intestine, intestinal contents, Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, and spleen of mice following oral infection [49]. Recently, using an in vitro polarized co-cultured human intestinal cell culture model, wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium and mutants lacking multiple SPI-1 effectors showed similar translocation of host cells [39]. Results from these studies and the naturally occurring Salmonella infection, demonstrate the lack of dependence of Salmonella on SPI-1 to cause disease in human and animal hosts. These studies not only corroborate our findings regarding the lack of Salmonella dependence on SPI-1 to invade our 3-D organotypic intestinal epithelial models, but also demonstrate the urgent need for development of more in vivo-like cell culture systems and their use in combination with animal models to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. In an attempt to identify the bacterial mechanism(s) playing a role in invasion of our 3-D intestinal epithelial cells in the absence of SPI-1, we constructed a Salmonella mutant absent for all characterized T3SSs that could be utilized to secrete effectors aiding in invasion (SPI-1 T3SS, SPI-2 T3SS, and the flagellar pore). Interestingly, invasion of the SPI-1/2/flagellar secretory mutant (defective for all T3SSs) still occurred in our 3-D intestinal model (Figure 2), alluding to the potential of an uncharacterized or undiscovered mechanism(s) utilized by Salmonella for invasion into 3-D intestinal cells and possibly during infection as well. Currently, 12 different Salmonella pathogenicity islands (PAIs) have been identified based on genetic classifications and characteristics of PAIs, however many of the identified PAI-encoded genes only have predicted putative functions with no clear role in Salmonella pathogenesis [72]. Interestingly, several PAIs are predicted to encode functions that have the capacity to assist in Salmonella invasion of 3-D intestinal cells, with numerous genes encoding for pili and fimbrae [73], [74]. Similar with published reports, we have already demonstrated that type 1 pili encoded by the fim operon is not necessary for invasion into 3-D intestinal cells (Figure 3C and D), however in work done by others, SPI-7 was shown to contain a putative type IVB pilus that could be aiding in bacterial invasion in this study [57], [72]. Moreover, SPI-6 and SPI-10 encode for fimbrae, and both were shown to be critical in bacterial invasion and intracellular survival [72], [75], [76], [77], [78]. However, the genomes of Salmonella serovars contain large numbers of fimbrial operons located outside of PAIs, any of which could potentially be responsible for the SPI-1 independent invasion of 3-D intestinal cells, in turn making the identification of the exact invasion mechanism(s) quite challenging [79], [80]. Moreover, in recent work, SPI-4 was demonstrated to encode a functional T1SS used to secrete effectors necessary for bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells [81]. To further complicate identification of the mechanism(s) responsible for Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal cells, the epithelial cells themselves will also likely express and display surface structures necessary for bacterial invasion. Accordingly, both host and bacterial factor(s) have to be investigated, and we are currently examining several of these mechanisms in the attempt to identify the means of Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we utilized a rotating cell culture system that allows mammalian cells to be grown under physiological levels of fluid shear stress that help facilitate the formation of 3-D cellular aggregates possessing structural and functional characteristics similar to the in vivo parental tissues [36]. As previously observed in vivo where Salmonella was able to infect a host in the absence of a functional SPI-1 T3SS, we have shown analogous results in our 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelium. We also show that Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal models occurred in the absence of all characterized S. typhimurium type three secretory systems (SPI-1 T3SS, SPI-2 T3SS, and flagellar pore) that could be transporting bacterial effectors assisting in invasion into host epithelial cells. Moreover, our results indicate that invasion of 3-D intestinal cells by wildtype and SPI mutants was a bacterial active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains did not invade the 3-D cells, even those cells with known absorptive properties, including M-cells/M-like cells and enterocytes. Studies are on-going in our lab to define the molecular mechanism(s) of Salmonella SPI-1 independent epithelial cell invasion into our 3-D intestinal models. The work presented here reveals many key similarities between the response of in vitro 3-D models of human intestinal epithelium and their parental tissues in vivo during a Salmonella infection, highlighting the potential of these organotypic models to 1) serve as powerful tools to facilitate the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of human enteric salmonellosis, 2) provide an in vivo like system to study other gastrointestinal pathogens, and 3) serve as models for the development of novel strategies to combat infectious disease.",

Copyright notice ID: 3012082 PMID: 21206750 Abstract The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.Introduction Infections with nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars are a leading cause of bacterial enteric disease and are the single most common cause of death from food-borne illnesses in the United States [1]. An essential feature of the pathogenicity of Salmonella is its interaction with host intestinal epithelial cells, where Salmonella invasion/entry into host cells is critical for bacterial survival and establishment of disease in a host. Currently, it is thought that Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells requires the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS), a Gram negative bacterial “molecular syringe” that injects effector proteins into the host cell cytosol, thus altering cellular functions [2], [3], [4]. Salmonella possesses two T3SSs that direct the secretion of proteins into host cells, and a third T3SS that directs the secretion of proteins to be assembled into the external flagellular organelle [5], [6]. The T3SS considered to be necessary for epithelial cell invasion is encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), a large region of the Salmonella genome that contains numerous genes involved in pathogenesis and infection [6], [7], [8], [9]. The second T3SS is encoded on a second pathogenicity island, SPI-2, which is induced after Salmonella invasion of host cells and secretes protein effectors necessary for intracellular bacterial trafficking and replication [10], [11]. The third T3SS is under the transcriptional control of the flhDC operon, the master regulator of the flagellum assembly machinery [5], [12], [13], [14]. A significant portion of our knowledge regarding Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella) T3SSs and their role in infection of epithelial cells has been derived from studies that utilized non-polarized monolayer cell culture systems [6], [10], [15]. However, during in vivo infections, Salmonella infects polarized epithelial cells of the host intestinal tract [16]. In recognition that conventional monolayer cell culture models do not display the structure, morphology, and architecture of the intestinal tract, more advanced and in vivo-like model systems have been developed and implemented to study Salmonella pathogenesis, which include polarized intestinal cell culture models, ileal loop models, C. elegans model, and mouse, cattle, and chick animal models [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Studies utilizing these more complex model systems demonstrated that SPI-1 was critical in the establishment of a Salmonella infection. While these model systems have certainly unveiled critical insight into the lifecycle and pathogenic mechanisms of Salmonella, the majority of these studies have utilized non-human model systems to predict what potentially could be occurring during infection of humans. Moreover, it was shown that the severity and role of SPI-1 and 2 to cause infection by Salmonella Typhimurium depends on the host species, which further complicates data extrapolation to the human condition [21], [23], [27]. The importance of host species in investigating and understanding the mechanisms of Salmonella-induced gastrointestinal disease was further demonstrated in a recent key study looking at a naturally occurring Salmonella outbreak in humans, which revealed conflicting results as compared to monolayers and non-human animal models [28]. Specifically, the study identified two clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg present in stool samples from a food-borne human disease outbreak that lacked essential SPI-1 T3SS structural components and SPI-1 encoded secreted effectors [28]. Infection of mice with these isolated strains displayed little to no intestinal pathology or inflammation, suggesting these bacterial strains are limited to cause only human enteropathology. Furthermore, these naturally occurring SPI-1 deficient strains invaded human monolayer cells less efficiently than laboratory constructed SPI-1 mutants, further demonstrating differences between monolayer systems and in vivo outcomes of infection. Collectively, these studies demonstrate how different Salmonella infection model systems can give conflicting results, with the most dependable and accurate model being the natural host. Unfortunately, a human Salmonella infection model is unrealistic and impractical, in turn the next best model system would be one that best approximates the parental tissue in vivo. To achieve an in vitro cell culture model that more closely mimics in vivo cellular characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, multicellular complexity, mucus production, apical/basolateral polarity, and well developed tight junction formation [29], our laboratory utilizes the Rotating-Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor system (Figure 1). The gentle fluid rotation of the RWV creates a physiological low fluid shear environment that allows the cells to grow in three-dimensions, aggregate based on natural cellular affinities, and differentiate into human surrogate tissue-like models possessing in vivo characteristics not observed in the same cells grown as monolayers [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. In this study we use a RWV-generated organotypic 3-D model derived from the colon epithelial cell line, HT-29. HT-29 cells were chosen as the model cell line in this study because a) they have been extensively characterized in 3-D and shown to be a physiologically relevant model of the parental tissue from which they were derived [32], b) they represent the primary site of Salmonella intestinal infection [37], c) we have previously applied this system to model fundamental aspects of the host-pathogen interactions with Salmonella [32], and d) numerous studies have been conducted using this cell line grown as monolayers to study the initial stages of the host-pathogen interaction between Salmonella and intestinal epithelium that lead to gastrointestinal disease [18], [32], [38]. Figure 1. Depiction and operation of the RWV cell culture system. Open in a new tab A) Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor containing cell culture media and porous microcarrier beads. B) Sedimentation of cells within the RWV is offset by the rotating fluid, creating a constant free fall of the cells through the culture medium, allowing the cells to form 3-D aggregates under conditions of physiological fluid shear. Three-dimensional aggregates are taken out of the bioreactor for analysis including light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (i), or seeded evenly in a 24 well plate format for various profiling and infection assays (ii). C) Enlarged representation of intestinal epithelial cells attached to microcarrier beads of a 3-D aggregate. After intestinal epithelial cells adhere to the beads, they begin to differentiate and display in vivo-like characteristics such as narrow columnar cellular morphology, basement membrane, tight junctions, mucus, and microvilli [31], [32], [36]. D) A further enlarged depiction of a single bead within the 3-D aggregate displaying characterized cellular surface structures and components, and infected with Salmonella.In this work, we demonstrate several key aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis during infection of RWV-derived 3-D organotypic models of human colonic epithelium that mimic in vivo observations, but contradict prevailing paradigms established using monolayers and many non-human model systems. We report for the first time that Salmonella is able to invade 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known Salmonella T3SSs, including SPI-1 and SPI-2 encoded T3SSs and the flagellar secretory system regulated by the flhDC operon [13]. Within the 3-D intestinal epithelial aggregates, we were able to identify three different epithelial cell types that are present in the human large intestine, further showing the complexity and physiological relevance of the 3-D intestinal model. Unlike previous in vitro reports, there was no identifiable preferential host cell type targeted in our 3-D intestinal models during infection by wildtype or the T3SS Salmonella mutants [39], [40], [41], [42]. Non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial-size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not appear to be localized intracellularly in 3-D intestinal cells, demonstrating that an active bacterial invasion mechanism(s) is necessary for internalization, rather than a non-specific host cellular uptake mechanism. Following invasion of 3-D cells, the SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2 double mutant, and the SPI-1/2 flhDC triple T3SS mutant, all grew to similar levels intracellularly, but to substantially lower levels than wildtype Salmonella. Collectively, we provide evidence that our highly differentiated 3-D models of human colonic epithelium exhibit infection phenotypes that are consistent with an in vivo enteric Salmonella infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report that bacterial invasion, but not intracellular growth, is largely independent of the functions encoded by TTSSs.Results Salmonella invades 3-D intestinal cells in the absence of SPI-1, SPI-2, and flagellum T3SSs and their effector proteins In previous reports from our lab utilizing classic gentamicin invasion assays, we showed that a Salmonella invA mutant that is defective for invading monolayers, exhibited wildtype levels of invasion into 3-D HT-29 colon cells [32], [43]. InvA is encoded by SPI-1 and is essential in the formation of the T3SS needle. However, SPI-1 encodes for numerous other genes aside from invA that are involved in bacterial invasion and virulence [2]. To investigate if alternative SPI-1 encoded effector protein(s) are potentially responsible for Salmonella invasion into 3-D intestinal cells, we infected HT-29 monolayers and 3-D aggregates with either a Salmonella mutant lacking the invA gene or a mutant lacking the entire SPI-1 encoding region (Figure 2A). The invA mutant and the SPI-1 mutant both invaded 3-D HT-29 cells to higher levels compared to monolayers. These data suggest that SPI-1, a virulence factor previously identified to be required for Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells grown as monolayers [9], [44], is not mandatory for invasion into our well-differentiated 3-D intestinal epithelial cells. Figure 2. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system are not required for Salmonella invasion into 3-D intestinal cells. Open in a new tab A) HT-29 monolayers (black bars) and 3-D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, ΔinvA, ΔSPI-1, ΔSPI-2, and ΔSPI-1/2 Salmonella mutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium. B) Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected as in (A), fixed at 3 hpi, stained with a Salmonella monoclonal antibody (extracellular bacteria), washed, permeabilized, stained with a Salmonella polyclonal antibody (extracellular and intracellular bacteria), and imaged by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.

Limit of detection is 10 CFU. * and ** indicate statistical significance of p<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 3-D aggregates to monolayers for each bacterial strain.We next wanted to test the hypothesis that the second T3SS encoded by SPI-2 and/or its encoded effectors were potentially compensating for the loss of SPI-1, thereby aiding in the invasion of Salmonella into the 3-D cells. To address this question, we infected HT-29 monolayers and 3-D cells with a SPI-2 deletion mutant and a SPI-1/SPI-2 double mutant (Figure 2A). The double mutant was still able to invade 3-D cells to significantly higher levels compared to monolayers, and to similar levels observed for SPI-1 and SPI-2 mutants in 3-D cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that unlike monolayers, Salmonella can invade the more in vivo-like 3-D cells in the absence of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs and their encoded effectors. However, the SPI-1 and SPI-2 genomic regions do contribute to a more productive invasion, as wildtype Salmonella exhibited significantly higher levels of invasion compared to the T3SS mutants in 3-D cells. Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were previously shown to secrete mucus, which could cause bacteria to adhere to the surface of the cells and not actually be localized intracellularly [32]. Thus, to further validate that wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant are indeed localized inside 3-D HT-29 cells, we performed a differential immunofluorescence microscopy staining technique that allows one to distinguish between extra- and intracellular bacteria [45], [46]. Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected with wildtype and Salmonella SPI-1 and SPI-1/2 mutants as in (A), fixed, and stained with a monoclonal anti-Salmonella antibody that will bind only extracellular bacteria. After addition of corresponding secondary antibody, cells were washed, permeabilized, and stained with a polyclonal Salmonella antibody that can bind to intracellular and extracellular bacteria as a result of host cell membrane permeabilization (Figure S1). Three-dimensional cells were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and the bacteria that only stained with the monoclonal antibody (pre-permeabilization/extracellular bacteria) were counted out of 50 total bacteria (stained with both antibodies) in at least three independent experiments (Figure 2B). A majority of the wildtype and Salmonella T3SS mutants were localized intracellularly (>60% of total bacteria counted), and no significant difference in bacterial localization was observed between wildtype and T3SS mutants, further demonstrating that Salmonella can invade into 3-D HT-29 cells in the absence of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs. As shown, Salmonella SPI-1 and 2 T3SSs mutants can invade 3-D HT-29 cells; however, we wanted to investigate if Salmonella was entering 3-D HT-29 cells through non-specific cellular uptake and not a Salmonella active invasion mechanism. To test if 3-D cells are capable of particle uptake, we introduced bacterial sized fluorescent beads to the cells under the identical experimental conditions used for our Salmonella infection assays. Three hours post bead exposure; cells were fixed, stained with phalloidin to visualize host cell actin cytoskeleton, and imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2C). The only beads observed were those that appeared to be extracellular in localization. The extracellular localization was further confirmed by z-stack confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure S2). Next we wanted to investigate if bacterial surface component(s) and/or bacterial active process(s) are required to be present for cellular uptake. We thus infected 3D HT-29 cells with non-invasive Gram negative E. coli and Gram positive B. subtilis strains, which represent bacteria that have very different surface structures and do not posses mechanisms necessary for host cell invasion. Three hours post infection, we observed no intracellular bacteria by gentamicin survival assay or confocal microscopy (Figure 2D and data not shown). These data suggest that either an invasion mechanism is necessary for internalization, or alternatively, a Salmonella specific surface component/structure is triggering Salmonella internalization by 3-D HT-29 cells. To determine between these two possibilities, monolayer and 3-D HT-29 cells were infected with heat-killed wildtype Salmonella for 1 hour, washed, and fixed. Cells were stained with anti-Salmonella antibody, phalloidin, and DAPI to visualize host and bacterial nuclei, and visualized by confocal microscopy using z-stack imaging. We observed no intracellular Salmonella in either monolayer or 3-D HT-29 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that Salmonella is actively invading 3-D HT-29 cells utilizing a mechanism(s) other than the SPI-1 or 2 encoded T3SSs. Another possible means of Salmonella protein effector secretion that could potentiate invasion and allow Salmonella active entry into 3-D cells is through a pore created in the bacterial membrane as a result of flagellum translocation to the surface, which occurs through a third T3SS [47], [48]. To test the hypothesis that secreted effector(s) responsible for invasion of the Salmonella SPI-1/2 double mutant into 3-D cells is a result of the flagellum pore; we infected cells with a Salmonella mutant deficient in SPI-1, SPI-2, and the master regulators of flagellum pore formation and synthesis, FlhC and FlhD (Figure 2E). The SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC mutant was still able to significantly invade the 3-D HT-29 aggregates, demonstrating that Salmonella can actively invade 3-D intestinal cells in the absence of all known/characterized T3SSs. Salmonella does not preferentially target M-cells/M-like cells in 3-D HT-29 models The work presented here is the first to report that all known T3SSs are not mandatory for Salmonella invasion into epithelial cells, which is consistent with reports of SPI-1 deficient strains being isolated from humans with enteric salmonellosis and animal intestinal tissues [28], [49]. Moreover, a Salmonella SPI-1 mutant has also been shown to preferentially target and invade mouse epithelial M cells and polarized epithelial cells cultured under conditions that allow them to express M-cell like phenotypes, phenotypes that include particle uptake and transportation of antigens [16], [39], [41], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. From these studies, we hypothesized that Salmonella and the T3SS mutants are targeting M-cells to eventually gain entry into the 3-D aggregates. To first observe if the aggregates contained M-cells or M-cell like cells, we stained uninfected 3-D HT-29 cells with anti-sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M-cell marker) and imaged the cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the 3-D aggregates exhibited very similar staining and expression patterns of the M-cell marker as observed in normal human colon tissue sections [55]. Specifically, the 3-D cells displayed a columnar morphology to where only the edges of >20% of the cells showed expression of the M-cell marker. We next wanted to observe if wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant preferentially targeted M-cells/M-like cells present in the 3-D aggregates to eventually gain intracellular localization (Figure 3A). Three-dimensional HT-29 cells were infected with either wildtype or the Salmonella SPI-1 mutant for ∼5 minutes at an m.o.i. of 10∶1 according to the infection protocol outlined by Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999 [56]. This established protocol allows for a shorter infection time, a more synchronized infection, and earlier cellular fixation periods, while maintaining the same Salmonella intracellular growth and trafficking profiles observed with longer and more commonly used infection protocols (Figure S3A-C) [56]. Wildtype Salmonella SPI-1 induction during the different growth conditions utilized in these studies was also analyzed, and no observable or significant differences in SPI-1 expression was seen by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively (Figure S3D, Text S1, and data not shown). After infection, cells were fixed 5–10 mpi to capture the early stages of infection, and stained with anti-sialyl Lewis A antigen antibody (M-cell marker), anti-Salmonella antibody, and DAPI to visualize nuclei (Figures 3A, S4, and S5) [55]. Quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of wildtype and SPI-1 mutant bacteria out of 50 bacteria in at least 3 independent experiments that localized to cells expressing M-cell marker revealed only 20–25% of wildtype and SPI-1 mutant localized to M-cells/M-like cells, and similar levels were also observed with the wildtype, SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/2: flhDC strains (Figure 3B). These data suggest that there is no preferential targeting of wildtype Salmonella and the T3SS mutants to M-cells/M-like cells within the 3-D aggregates. Figure 3. Internalization of wildtype or T3SS mutants into 3-D intestinal cells is not exclusively dependent on M-cells/M-like cells.

No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker. C) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images (100× objective) of 3-D HT-29 aggregates infected with a Salmonella type 1 pili mutant (ΔfimA-H) and stained with anti-sialyl Lewis A antibody (red), anti-Salmonella antibody (green), and DAPI (blue). D) HT-29 3-D aggregates infected with wildtype, ΔfimH, and ΔfimA-H Salmonella mutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10. To measure bacterial invasion, host cells were lysed at 3 hpi and intracellular bacteria were enumerated and plotted as CFU obtained for each bacterium (N≥3).As shown in Figure 3B, Salmonella T3SSs are not needed for localization to 3-D HT-29 M-cells/M-like cells, however recent reports suggest that FimH, a component of type I pili, interacts with an M-cell surface protein and this interaction is necessary for Salmonella intestinal invasion specifically into M-cells [42], [57]. To determine if the type I pili is playing a role in Salmonella targeting and internalization into 3-D aggregates, and more specifically M-cells, we infected 3-D HT-29 cells with a type I pili mutant (ΔFimA-H). Consistent with reports that type I pili is needed to bind to M-cells in order to invade these cell types; we observed no co-localization of Salmonella pili mutant with the M-cell marker at 5-10 mpi by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 3C). However, both the mutant lacking entire pili (ΔfimA-H) and the mutant lacking just the adhesion portion of the pili (ΔfimH), were still able to invade 3-D cells to similar levels as wildtype (Figure 3D). Utilization of the Fim mutants is also functioning as a control for bacteria that cannot interact with M-cells, but can still invade our 3-D aggregates, demonstrating that Salmonella entry into 3-D cells is not solely dependent upon interactions with M-cell/M-like cells. Salmonella T3SS mutants target multiple intestinal epithelial cell types within 3-D aggregates The large intestine, from which HT-29 cells are derived, is composed of multiple epithelial cell types, and we used confocal microscopy to assess if any of these cell types are present in our 3-D aggregates and if Salmonella is targeting these cell types during infection [58]. We identified two other cell types in addition to M-cells/M-like cells using immunofluorescence labeling, enterocytes and Paneth cells (Figures 4 A and C). Since enterocytes make up the majority of cells within the intestine and also have known absorptive properties, we predicted that a significant proportion of Salmonella not localized to M-cells/M-like cells could be targeting enterocytes [59]. After dual staining of 3-D HT-29 cells with the M-cell marker (sialyl Lewis A) and enterocyte marker (syndecan-1) antibodies, we observed very little overlap of cells expressing both markers, demonstrating two different cellular populations within the aggregates (Figure S6) [54], [55], [60], [61]. Three-dimensional cells were infected with either wildtype or SPI-1 Salmonella mutant, fixed 5 mpi, stained with both enterocyte and Salmonella specific antibodies, and the number of bacteria out of ∼50 bacteria localized to the enterocyte marker was quantitated by confocal immunofluorescence (Figure 4B). A majority of bacteria localized to cells expressing the enterocyte marker, with no significant difference in localization between wildtype and the SPI-1 mutant, suggesting that the SPI-1 encoded T3SS does not play a role in host cell type targeting in the intestinal epithelium during infection. Figure 4. No preferential host cell type is targeted by wildtype and T3SS Salmonella mutants during infection of 3-D intestinal cells.

Percentages represent number of bacteria localized to Paneth cell marker (N = 3). E) Quantitation of confocal images as observed in Figs. 3A, 4B and 4D, and also including 3-D HT-29 aggregates infected for 5-10 min with SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/2: flhDC Salmonella mutants and profiled with host cellular markers. Percentages represent the number of bacteria localized to markers/∼50 bacteria from three different experiments and independent batches of 3-D HT-29 cells. No significant difference was observed when comparing each bacterial strain to wildtype for each host cell marker (N = 3).The third cell type we identified in the 3-D HT-29 aggregates were Paneth cells, a cell type known to secrete antimicrobials, including defensins, with no detectable absorptive properties [62], [63], [64], [65] (Figure 4C). After 3-D HT-29 infection with the wildtype or SPI-1 mutant, and quantitation by confocal microscopy of the number of bacteria out of ∼50 bacteria that localized to cells expressing the Paneth cell marker (Phospholipase A2) [66], we observed <10% of bacteria localized to cells expressing this marker (Figure 4D). Consistent with previous reports of diseased colon tissue samples, we noted an increase in Paneth cell marker expression upon infection (Figure 4C and D) [64], [65]. Goblet cells are a known fourth cell type within the intestine. While our 3-D HT-29 cells did exhibit mucus production (a hallmark of goblet cells), we were unable to definitively identify goblet cells in the 3-D HT-29 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using a goblet cell marker antibody [32], [67]. The Salmonella SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/2: flhDC mutants were also profiled for host cell type localization within the 3-D HT-29 aggregates, and similar localization profiles with no significant difference in marker localization of these mutants were observed as compared to wildtype Salmonella (Figure 4E). Collectively, these data suggest that Salmonella T3SSs do not influence the active targeting of the bacteria to a specific cell type in the 3-D intestinal cells during infection. Salmonella T3SSs are required for substantial intracellular growth in 3-D HT-29 cells Our data established that Salmonella T3SSs are not required for invasion into 3-D HT-29 cells; however we were interested in observing the intracellular growth profiles of the T3SS mutants after entry into 3-D cells and their profiles compared to monolayers (Figure 5). We thus infected monolayers and 3-D HT-29 cells with the various bacterial strains at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour. At the indicated times post infection, host cells were lysed and bacteria were enumerated for colony forming units. Wildtype Salmonella and the SPI-2 mutant had similar growth profiles between monolayers and 3-D cells with an increase in growth by 24 hpi compared to 3 hpi. The SPI-1, SPI-1/2, flhDC, and SPI-1/2: flhDC mutants had little to no detectable growth by 24 hpi in monolayers; however, these mutants grew to levels similar as the SPI-2 mutant in 3-D cells, although the mutant strains never reached wildtype growth levels. The non-invasive Gram negative E. coli and Gram positive B. subtilis were also used as controls to infect 3-D cells; however neither bacterium had detectable intracellular growth by 24 hpi, further suggesting that a bacterial specific active invasion mechanism is necessary for bacterial internalization into 3-D cells. These growth curves also demonstrate the ability of the Salmonella mutants to invade and survive within 3-D cells for 24 hours, as they are not killed by the gentamicin in the extracellular media as observed with E. coli and B. subtilis (Figure 2D and Figure 5B). From these data, we conclude that SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretion system are not necessary for invasion into 3-D HT-29 cells, but are required for wildtype levels of invasion and intracellular replication.

Open in a new tab Intracellular growth of wildtype Salmonella, T3SS Salmonella mutants, and non-invasive E. coli and B. subtilis strains measured at 3 hpi (black bars), 8 hpi (gray bars), and 24 hpi (white bars) in HT-29 monolayers (A) and 3-D aggregates (B). For both cell culture models, HT-29 cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour and lysed at each indicated time point and plated to enumerate bacterial CFU. CFU quantitation represents an average of at least three independent experiments from three separate batches of cells. * and ** indicate statistical significance of p<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 8 and 24 hpi to 3 hpi for each bacterial strain.Discussion In previous work, we established and characterized a 3-D organotypic model of human large intestinal epithelium from the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 utilizing the cellular suspension RWV bioreactor system [32], [36]. HT-29 cells grown in three-dimensions in the RWV displayed numerous characteristics relevant to their in vivo tissue counterparts, demonstrating the potential of utilizing RWV-derived 3-D cells as surrogate models to elucidate cellular mechanisms and responses to conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract, such as during an enteric pathogen infection [32], [36]. We previously reported that an invA Salmonella mutant (which is defective for invasion of monolayers) invaded into 3-D HT-29 cells to similar levels as wildtype, and to our knowledge, this was the first report to suggest that the SPI-T3SS may not be the main determinant for invasion of Salmonella into in vitro models of human intestinal epithelium [32], [43]. While intriguing, our previous findings did not definitively preclude a role for the SPI-1 T3SS in intestinal invasion, nor did we apply the 3-D large intestinal model to investigate the role of the two other T3SSs in Salmonella, the SPI-2 encoded T3SS and the flhDC regulated flagellum secretory system. In this report, we fundamentally expanded our studies to show that the 3-D model of large intestinal epithelium displays multicellular complexity relevant to the normal parental tissue in vivo, including formation of M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes and Paneth cells. We subsequently applied these highly differentiated 3-D intestinal cultures as human surrogate infection models to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella T3SSs in the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis. Specifically, we infected 3-D HT-29 and monolayer cells with various Salmonella mutants carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and a complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC), respectively. We observed substantial differences in the roles of the T3SSs during invasion into and growth within the 3-D HT-29 cells as compared to monolayers, but notably, we identified similar key phenotypic responses between the 3-D cells following Salmonella challenge with those reported during the in vivo infection process. The initial key difference that we observed in response to infection between 3-D large intestinal cells and established data utilizing monolayers, was the significant increase in invasion of a SPI-1 encoded T3SS mutant into the 3-D cells (Figure 2A and B), a mutant previously characterized to be invasion defective in monolayers [43], [44]. The SPI-1 mutant lacking the entire SPI-1 coding region displayed lower levels of invasion compared to the invA T3SS mutant in both culture systems, and this could be a result of the absence of the entire SPI-1 PAI (Pathogenicity Island) in the SPI-1 mutant, which could potentially contain effectors aiding in bacterial invasion. Surprisingly, a SPI-1/2 double mutant and a SPI-1/2: flhDC triple mutant, a strain lacking all characterized T3SS secretion systems, also invaded into the 3-D intestinal cells at similar levels (Figure 2E). While the TTSS mutants were able to invade 3-D cells, the invasion levels were significantly lower compared to wildtype. These data suggest that TTSSs contribute to a more productive bacterial invasion of 3-D cells, but an unidentified bacterial factor(s) is contributing to majority of Salmonella invasion into 3-D cells. We are currently attempting to identify the bacterial and/or host factors that are the major regulators of invasion for Salmonella into human 3-D intestinal cells. However, once intracellular, each single, double and triple T3SS mutant was unable to grow to levels similar to that of wildtype (Figure 5B), suggesting that each T3SS system is necessary for successful replication of Salmonella inside 3-D intestinal cells. Interestingly, even though the SPI-1 mutant still contains the SPI-2 system and its encoded effectors predicted to be responsible for intracellular survival, the SPI-1 mutant did not replicate as well as wildtype once inside the host cells. These data are consistent with work utilizing monolayers showing that a Salmonella invA mutant was unable to grow after induced invasion of epithelial cells [68]. We are currently characterizing the role of SPI-2 and its secreted effectors in Salmonella intracellular trafficking and replication within our 3-D intestinal models. Until recently, the paradigm for Salmonella entry into human intestinal epithelial cells was based upon results from monolayer cell cultures and non-human animal models [6], [10], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [26], [27]; however our work with highly differentiated 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells cultivated in the RWV bioreactor demonstrated infection phenotypes more closely related to those observed in vivo [28], [31], [32], [36], [49]. The RWV bioreactor system is only one example of how advancements in technology facilitate the improvement of tissue engineered model systems to more accurately mimic in vivo conditions in the native host, thus allowing researchers to study host-pathogen interactions in an accessible, reproducible, and tractable in vitro system [22], [23], [24], [26], [36], [39]. However, as previously discussed, choice of host species has been shown to greatly influence the outcome of a Salmonella infection, and several studies utilizing a variety of advanced model systems have shown that T3SSs are necessary for Salmonella invasion and infection of these models [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [26], [39]. Recently however, non-human models studying Salmonella pathogenesis are in agreement with our findings reported in this study, that SPI-1 is not critical for the invasion of host cells. One such example was conducted by Coombes et al., 2005, wherein this group utilized a novel explant/re-implantation calf ileal loop model to investigate the role of SPI-1 and SPI-2 during the later stages of a Salmonella infection [69]. Interestingly, the SPI-1 Salmonella mutant not only infected the tissues of the small intestine, but by 5 days post infection, severe inflammation, submucosal edema, necrosis, vascular thrombosis, and villus atrophy had also occurred. In a separate study, Desin et al., 2009, observed colonization of a Salmonella enterica subsup. Enterica serovar Enteritidis strain lacking SPI-1 in the cecum of chickens [70]. In a similar example, the fowl-adapted Salmonella strain, Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum, was also able to invade animal cells independently of SPI-1 [71]. Moreover, a Salmonella Typhimurium SPI-1 mutant was recovered at comparable levels to the wildtype strain from the intestine, intestinal contents, Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, and spleen of mice following oral infection [49]. Recently, using an in vitro polarized co-cultured human intestinal cell culture model, wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium and mutants lacking multiple SPI-1 effectors showed similar translocation of host cells [39]. Results from these studies and the naturally occurring Salmonella infection, demonstrate the lack of dependence of Salmonella on SPI-1 to cause disease in human and animal hosts. These studies not only corroborate our findings regarding the lack of Salmonella dependence on SPI-1 to invade our 3-D organotypic intestinal epithelial models, but also demonstrate the urgent need for development of more in vivo-like cell culture systems and their use in combination with animal models to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. In an attempt to identify the bacterial mechanism(s) playing a role in invasion of our 3-D intestinal epithelial cells in the absence of SPI-1, we constructed a Salmonella mutant absent for all characterized T3SSs that could be utilized to secrete effectors aiding in invasion (SPI-1 T3SS, SPI-2 T3SS, and the flagellar pore). Interestingly, invasion of the SPI-1/2/flagellar secretory mutant (defective for all T3SSs) still occurred in our 3-D intestinal model (Figure 2), alluding to the potential of an uncharacterized or undiscovered mechanism(s) utilized by Salmonella for invasion into 3-D intestinal cells and possibly during infection as well. Currently, 12 different Salmonella pathogenicity islands (PAIs) have been identified based on genetic classifications and characteristics of PAIs, however many of the identified PAI-encoded genes only have predicted putative functions with no clear role in Salmonella pathogenesis [72]. Interestingly, several PAIs are predicted to encode functions that have the capacity to assist in Salmonella invasion of 3-D intestinal cells, with numerous genes encoding for pili and fimbrae [73], [74]. Similar with published reports, we have already demonstrated that type 1 pili encoded by the fim operon is not necessary for invasion into 3-D intestinal cells (Figure 3C and D), however in work done by others, SPI-7 was shown to contain a putative type IVB pilus that could be aiding in bacterial invasion in this study [57], [72]. Moreover, SPI-6 and SPI-10 encode for fimbrae, and both were shown to be critical in bacterial invasion and intracellular survival [72], [75], [76], [77], [78]. However, the genomes of Salmonella serovars contain large numbers of fimbrial operons located outside of PAIs, any of which could potentially be responsible for the SPI-1 independent invasion of 3-D intestinal cells, in turn making the identification of the exact invasion mechanism(s) quite challenging [79], [80]. Moreover, in recent work, SPI-4 was demonstrated to encode a functional T1SS used to secrete effectors necessary for bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells [81]. To further complicate identification of the mechanism(s) responsible for Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal cells, the epithelial cells themselves will also likely express and display surface structures necessary for bacterial invasion. Accordingly, both host and bacterial factor(s) have to be investigated, and we are currently examining several of these mechanisms in the attempt to identify the means of Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we utilized a rotating cell culture system that allows mammalian cells to be grown under physiological levels of fluid shear stress that help facilitate the formation of 3-D cellular aggregates possessing structural and functional characteristics similar to the in vivo parental tissues [36]. As previously observed in vivo where Salmonella was able to infect a host in the absence of a functional SPI-1 T3SS, we have shown analogous results in our 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelium. We also show that Salmonella invasion into our 3-D intestinal models occurred in the absence of all characterized S. typhimurium type three secretory systems (SPI-1 T3SS, SPI-2 T3SS, and flagellar pore) that could be transporting bacterial effectors assisting in invasion into host epithelial cells. Moreover, our results indicate that invasion of 3-D intestinal cells by wildtype and SPI mutants was a bacterial active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains did not invade the 3-D cells, even those cells with known absorptive properties, including M-cells/M-like cells and enterocytes. Studies are on-going in our lab to define the molecular mechanism(s) of Salmonella SPI-1 independent epithelial cell invasion into our 3-D intestinal models. The work presented here reveals many key similarities between the response of in vitro 3-D models of human intestinal epithelium and their parental tissues in vivo during a Salmonella infection, highlighting the potential of these organotypic models to 1) serve as powerful tools to facilitate the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of human enteric salmonellosis, 2) provide an in vivo like system to study other gastrointestinal pathogens, and 3) serve as models for the development of novel strategies to combat infectious disease.Materials And Methods Mammalian Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table S1. All bacterial strains were grown in Lennox broth (L broth) as described below [82]. The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) [32], [83], [84]. The cells were cultured in a specialized growth medium comprised of a triple-sugar minimal essential medium α–L-15 base supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, designated as GTSF-2 [85], and incubated at 37°C at 5% CO2 environment.Antibodies and Reagents Antibodies against specified antigens were obtained from the following sources: Sialyl Lewis A (MC-551; Kamiya), polyclonal Salmonella O antisera (BD Difco), monoclonal Salmonella antibody (MAI-83451; Affinity Bioreagents), syndecan-1 (MCA681T; AbD seroTec), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (ab58375; Abcam), ITF goblet cell marker (15C6; Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (A22284; Invitrogen). Fluoresbrite plain YG 2.00 micron microspheres (fluorescent beads) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (18338). For mammalian cell viability, 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) was used at a 1∶1 ratio with cells suspended in cell culture media.Growth of 3-D intestinal cells in the RWV The development of 3-D intestinal tissue models was performed as previously described [31], [32]. In brief, HT-29 epithelial cells were initially grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2×106 cells/ml. Cells were then introduced into RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Inc.) together with collagen-coated Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Pharmacia), resulting in a final ratio of ∼10 cells/bead [85]. Cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactors in GTSF-2 at 37°C and 5% CO2 with rotation at 20 rpm. Fresh medium was replenished after 5 days and then every 24 hours thereafter until harvest of the cultures at 18-23 days.Bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays HT-29 monolayers were grown in GTSF-2 medium in a 24-well plate at a concentration of ∼1.2 million cells/plate. For 3-D aggregates, cells were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of ∼19 million cells/plate. For infections, all bacterial strains were grown shaking overnight in L broth medium at 37°C. Bacteria were back-diluted 1∶200 and grown with aeration until the bacterial growth reached OD 600 of ∼0.8. Bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and used to infect mammalian cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h, whereupon infected cells were washed three times with D-PBS and incubated in medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin for 3 hour. The cells were then washed three times with D-PBS and fresh medium containing 7.5 µg/ml gentamicin was added. At indicated times post-infection (p.i.), media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 500 µl of 0.1% Triton-X 100, and a fraction of the lysate was plated on L agar to enumerate colony-forming units (CFU). For heat killed Salmonella studies, bacteria were taken from the back diluted Salmonella cultures, washed 3 times with D-PBS, resuspended in D-PBS, heated at 90°C for 30 minutes, and used to infect mammalian cells as with live Salmonella.Confocal Microscopy The 3-D aggregates were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded in a 24 well plate at a concentration of approximately 19 million cells/plate. Infections were done either using same protocol as invasion/intracellular growth assays described above, or an established protocol described by Mortimer et al., which allows for a shorter and synchronized infection [56]. In brief, Salmonella overnight cultures grown in LB shaking at 37°C were back diluted 1∶200 in LB and grown shaking until they reached an OD of ∼1.2. Bacteria were washed 2 times in D-PBS and used to infect mammalian cells at an m.o.i. of 10 for 5 minutes, whereupon host cells washed 3 times and media was replaced with media containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin. At indicated times p.i., 3-D aggregates were fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in D-PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. For staining, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (D-PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA). Blocking buffer with primary antibody (concentration antibody dependent) was added to the cells for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then rinsed three times with D-PBS and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody diluted 1∶1000 in blocking buffer. Aggregates were rinsed with D-PBS and mounted with Pro-Long Gold Anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with the Carl Zeiss 510 Inverted confocal microscope using a 100× objective and ZEN Light Edition 2009 software. Quantitation of Salmonella colocalization with the various host markers was determined by fixing cells at indicated times p.i., staining the cells with the designated host and Salmonella specific antibodies, then counting the number of bacteria that localized with the markers per 35-50 bacteria in at least three independent experiments. For differential immunofluorescence staining of extracellular and intracellular bacteria, infections were carried out as described above in the bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays section and staining was done as described in results section and in published reports [46].Statistical analysis Data sets in triplicate were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software to calculate the Student's unpaired t-test for independent samples. P-values of <0.05 (*) and <0.001 (**) were considered significant and highly significant, respectively.Supporting Information Text S1 Experimental Method. (DOC) Click here for additional data file.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are ubiquitous infectious agents in human populations (Schiffman et al., 2016) and the most common sexually transmitted pathogen (Satterwhite et al., 2013). Oncogenic HPV infections are responsible for a staggering ~5% of human cancers (de Martel et al., 2020; Zapatka et al., 2020). In addition to being responsible for virtually all cervical cancers, the incidence of HPV-associated oral cancers has dramatically increased during recent years (Chaturvedi et al., 2011; Marur et al., 2010), making oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) the most common HPV-related malignancy in the United States (Eisenberg et al., 2018). Of note, most HPV-positive OPSCCs arise in the tonsil crypts. Following the initial infection of basal cells, the HPV DNA is amplified and established as a low copy number extrachromosomal genome. Within these actively dividing cells, the HPV genome replicates alongside the host genome. As part of the cellular differentiation cycle, infected cells detach from the basement membrane and enter the suprabasal epithelial layer. Unlike uninfected cells, the expression of the viral E6 (Duffy et al., 2003; Kranjec et al., 2017; Morgan et al., 2018) and E7 (Bodily et al., 2011; Flores et al., 2000; Müller et al., 1999) proteins promotes unscheduled cell cycle progression, supporting continuous viral replication. As the cells continue to differentiate, increased expression of the E1 and E2 replication proteins leads to a transition towards productive viral DNA amplification (Sakakibara et al., 2013). Finally, within the terminally differentiated layers of the epithelium, the viral capsid proteins (L1, Buck et al., 2013); and L2, Wang & Roden, 2013) are synthesized, leading to virion assembly. This synchronized gene expression implies that the completion of the viral life cycle requires the three-dimensional stratified epithelium. Keratinocytes in the different strata of the differentiated tissue must coordinate their gene expression to fulfill specific and dynamic functions during cellular differentiation. At the stratum level, expression of many of the cellular genes are known, but how spatio-temporal gene expression is regulated is a topic of intense investigation (Cavazza et al., 2016; Finnegan et al., 2019; Joost et al., 2016; Klein et al., 2017; Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015; Rubin et al., 2019). Modeling the physiologically relevant tissues will be critical to further our understanding of the viral life cycle. The methods described in this protocol will outline two distinct and complementary approaches to reliably and reproducibly generate and characterize 3D tissues. By modeling the complexity of the full-thickness epithelium, these culture methods address a significant limitation of two-dimensional monolayer cultures. These culture models have been shown to faithfully recapitulate many morphological and physiological characteristics of tissue in vivo. These cultures not only preserve the cellular architecture of the cervical or tonsillar tissue but also respond to external stimuli in ways that mimic the response in the in vivo microenvironment (Asselineau & Prunieras, 1984; Kopan et al., 1987; Radtke et al., 2012; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012). We provide methods to successfully isolate oral and cervical cells from donor-derived tissues, grow these cells into 3D epithelial tissues, and characterize them through a series of microscopic (histological, scanning electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence) and transcriptome-based analyses (Fig. 1). Support Protocol 1 describes the isolation of primary epithelial cells (keratinocytes) from patient-derived tissues (e.g., cervical biopsies and tonsillectomies). These primary cultures are maintained as monolayers in Support Protocol 2 and screened for HPV DNA by PCR in Support Protocol 3. Basic Protocols 1 and 2 describe two distinct methods to generate 3D cultures: organotypic rafting or rotating wall vessel bioreactor. Cells and materials for Basic Protocol 2 are prepared using Support Protocol 4 (to grow and maintain cells) as well as Support Protocols 5 and 6 (to prepare the bioreactor and carrier beads used). An array of host differentiation and viral life cycle characterization techniques are detailed in Basic Protocol 3 (histology), Basic Protocols 3 and 4 (immunofluorescence for raft tissues or rotating wall vessel tissues, respectively), Basic Protocol 6 (electron microscopy), and Support Protocol 7 (RNA extraction) coupled with Basic Protocol 7 (RT-qPCR). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Flowchart of all protocols described in this protocol for preparing, culturing, and characterizing 3D oral and cervical tissue models for studying interactions between HPV and the infected host. The dotted line connecting Support Protocol 1 to Basic Protocol 2 indicates that, with proper optimization, it should be feasible to culture primary cells in the Rotating wall vessel bioreactor.Biosafety and ethics considerations CAUTION: Human tissues, cells, and HPV virions are a potential biohazard. Laboratory personnel should follow all biosafety and ethical guidelines relevant to local facilities, institutions, and governing bodies to properly acquire and handle donor-derived human samples that may contain pathogenic microorganisms. Appropriately trained individuals should conduct all work in accordance with your local guidelines and regulations. Human papillomavirus is considered a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen (Dunne et al., 2014; Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)) and since 3D raft cultures are capable of producing infectious viral particles within the superficial layer (as virus-laden squames), BSL-2 precautions (e.g., personal protective equipment and using a biosafety cabinet) must be taken while handling cultures. In addition to good laboratory practice and aseptic technique, these precautions ensure reader safety and preserve the quality of results by limiting contamination. SUPPORT PROTOCOL 1: Isolation of epithelial cells from patient derived tissues Keratinocytes are the predominant cell type that comprises stratified epithelia and can be isolated directly from patient-derived donor tissues from anatomic sites (e.g., oral and cervical epithelia) relevant to the HPV life cycle. This protocol provides detailed steps to isolate these primary cells from donor specific tissues. These tissues should be isolated by qualified medical personnel in accordance with institutional and Federal human protection guidelines. Tissues and isolated cell lines are a biosafety level 2 pathogen and should be handled accordingly. As an alternative, primary keratinocytes are available commercially.

More starter material, with greater epithelial surface area, will yield more keratinocytes and a greater chance of success. Ideally start with at least 10 mm × 10 mm of tissue. We have successfully used this protocol with smaller input (e.g., small cervical biopsies: < 5 mm of tissue). Store samples at 4°C overnight (~16 hrs). Keep tissues from multiple donors in separate tubes. Tissues should be processed next day, and not stored for more than 2 days. Rinse tissue once in 1X D-PBS. Perform this and all subsequent steps at room temperature (unless otherwise stated for incubations) and in a biosafety cabinet, adhering to aseptic technique. Observe gross morphology, measure tissue dimensions, and photograph for records. (Optional) Dissect and reserve parts of the tissue (~5 mm in all dimension, containing epithelium) for histology or downstream molecular analysis Fix tissue in 10% buffered formalin for a minimum of 24 hours in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (with enough volume to cover the piece, 500 to 1000 μl should be sufficient for pieces ~5 mm in all dimensions), then wash twice using equal volumes of 70% EtOH. Samples can be stored in 70% EtOH at room temperature for several weeks if needed. Following embedding in paraffin and sectioning, these samples can be processed as described in basic protocol 3. Larger tissues (>10 mm) should be incubated longer, to allow full penetration of fixative into tissue. Flash-freeze tissues for molecular analysis in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C. In a 10 cm dish, use forceps and scalpel with blade to remove the underlying hypodermis and loose connective tissue as much as possible while leaving the epithelial lining/casing intact (see Fig. 2). It is critical that the epithelial portion of the tissue is not discarded, as this contains the keratinocytes. The goal of this step is to remove as much of the non-epithelial tissue as possible so that a pure culture can be achieved. Dissect the tissue into smaller pieces (< 10 mm in size). Place the tissue piece(s) in the wells of a 6-well plate, ensuring they are not overly crowded and can lay flat (and that they separate donor tissues are kept apart), and cover using 2 ml room temperature dispase II (2.4 U/ml in HBSS, with antibiotics and antimycotic added: penicillin and streptomycin at 1X, and amphotericin B at 0.625 μg/ml). Incubate tissue overnight at 4°C (~16 hours). Process tissue to isolate and create a suspension of keratinocytes: Transfer the tissues to a 10 cm tissue culture dish. The epidermis is separated with forceps from any underlying dermal tissue remaining. Scrape these cells from the underlying tissue if the layer doesn’t separate cleanly off, and place the epidermal layer in a 50 ml tube containing 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Incubate the tissue in the 0.25% trypsin/EDTA at 37°C for 10 to 20 min to dissociate the epidermal cells, mixing gently every few minutes by swirling. Inactivate the trypsin by adding 10 ml inactivation media, pipetting up and down 10 times to mix thoroughly. Pass this solution (~12 ml) through a cell strainer filter (70 μm), into a 50 ml tube, rinse the 15 ml tube with 5 ml inactivation media, then centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min. The cells can be counted and viability assessed via Trypan-blue exclusion at this stage. Resuspend the pellet in complete F-media (including antibiotics and amphotericin B) and plate them onto irradiated J2 fibroblasts in a 10 cm tissue culture dish (as described in Support Protocol 2).

Arrows depict the epithelial casing (it is critical that this portion be kept, as it contains the keratinocytes) and the underlying hypodermis (and lymphoid) tissue. SUPPORT PROTOCOL 2: Growth and maintenance of primary human epithelial cells in monolayer culture Primary human keratinocytes are used to seed 3D raft cultures described in Basic Protocol 1. Our lab cultures these cells in co-culture with terminally differentiated J2 fibroblast feeder cells as described by Rheinwald and Green (Rheinwald & Green, 1975b). This protocol describes how to culture and expand these primary cells. Materials Reagents, solutions, and cell lines Primary epithelial cells in culture: sub-confluent 10 cm plate Versene (0.48 mM EDTA in PBS, ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 15040066) Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190–144) 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 25200056) Rheinwald-Green media (F-media; see recipe) J2 fibroblast growth media (see recipe) 0.4% Trypan blue (VWR, cat. no. 97063–702) ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; Chemdea, cat. no.

Critical. Cells should be used at low passage. J2 cell morphology should be monitored to avoid transformation of the feeder culture. Plate 1 × 106 feeders on a 10-cm dish and allow them to attach and spread overnight in a 37°C CO2 incubator. Irradiate cells with a dose of 6000R. Change the medium to complete F-media and plate 200,000 primary cells (e.g., from Support Protocol 1, Step 10) onto the irradiated feeder monolayer. ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) can be added to these cultures at a final concentration of 10 μM to conditionally immortalize these primary epithelial cells (Chapman et al., 2010, 2014). It is critical that Y-27632 is removed before differentiating the cells using raft or RWV technologies. Replace the media every 48 hours until cells reach 85–90% confluency. Critical. Cells should grow in individual colonies and should not contact neighboring colonies. Remove 10 cm plate of primary epithelial cells (e.g., human tonsillar keratinocytes, HTKs; or human cervical keratinocytes, HCKs) from the incubator and confirm by microscope that they are ready to harvest: sub-confluent, just before colonies start to touch. If this is the first passage of the isolated cells it is important that you preserve their viability and make sufficient cryovial stocks. The majority of the cells harvested should be used for making these stocks, continued culturing, or for experiments or other molecular extractions. Only a small number of cells (< 106) will be needed for DNA isolation. In a biosafety cabinet, use a Pasteur pipette to vacuum aspirate the media from the cells, using the edge of the plate to avoid scraping the surface layer of cells. Add 5 ml of Versene to the plate using a serological pipette, ensure full coverage by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at room temperature for 1 min, then pipette the Versene up and down over the cells to help remove the feeder cells. Confirm by microscope that the feeders lift from the plate. It may be necessary to slightly agitate the plate by rocking back and forth, taking care not to spill the contents. Versene will cause the J2 fibroblast feeder cells to detach whilst leaving the keratinocytes adhered. Vacuum aspirate the Versene and suspended J2 feeder cells. Rinse the cells in 5 ml D-PBS to help remove any residual J2 feeder cells. Vacuum aspirate the D-PBS and any residual feeder cells. Add 3 ml of 37°C 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, ensure full coverage of the surface of the plate by rocking back and forth and side-to-side, and incubate at 37°C until keratinocyte colonies are dissociated and detached from the plate (~5 to 10 min). Check by microscope often to ensure cells do not remain in trypsin longer than necessary. Add 7 ml of F-media to inactivate the trypsin, pipette up/down, rinsing the plate, to create a cell suspension, and transfer this 10 ml total volume to a 50 ml conical tube. These cells can be counted, to determine the number of cells per ml, and used in downstream protocols (for seeding the basal keratinocyte layer in Basic Protocol 1; for PCR-based HPV screening in Support Protocol 3; and as a 2D monolayer control for RNA extraction in Support Protocol 7 and RT-qPCR in Basic Protocol 7). SUPPORT PROTOCOL 3: PCR-based HPV screening of primary cell cultures HPV infections are prevalent. As such, it is possible that the primary human oral or cervical epithelial cells were infected at the time of isolation. This protocol uses a well-characterized degenerate primer PCR to amplify a 450 bp fragment of the L1 gene (Manos et al., 1989; Tachezy et al., 1994). This PCR can detect a wide array of HPV types. Since we typically experimentally infect these primary cells with HPV virions, we only use cell lines that are negative for HPV sequences.

Calculate the required volume of cell suspension needed for DNA isolation. We find that starting with 7.5 × 105 cells for DNA isolation will typically yield ~10 to 20 μg of purified DNA: 50 to 100 ng/μl of 200 μl eluate. Centrifuge cells 150 × g for 7 min. Aspirate the supernatant carefully, without disturbing the pellet, then resuspend in 5 ml D-PBS to wash. Centrifuge 150 × g for 7 min. Aspirate supernatant, then proceed with DNA isolation (cell lysis). If you wish to perform DNA isolation at a future time you can flash freeze this pellet of cells in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C. The cells will no longer be viable, but the DNA should remain stable, and we recommend flash-freezing and storing at such low temperatures in case you also need to preserve the samples for RNA isolation. Extract DNA using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit following instructions. We elute with 2 × 100 μl pre-warmed (56°C) molecular-grade nuclease-free water. Measure DNA concentration and purity spectrophotometrically, using the same elution buffer as a blank. Concentration will depend on several factors, including the number of cells used for extraction, elution volume used, and the overall success of the cell lysis and DNA isolation procedure. Refer to your DNA isolation kit troubleshooting guide for tips on improving yield and purity.

Part 4 Visualize specific PCR amplicons by gel electrophoresis Cast a gel by mixing agarose powder (2 g for a 2% gel) with 100 ml 1x TAE. Once fully solidified, cover the gel with 1x TAE, and remove the comb. Ensure wells are intact. Load samples with gel loading pipet tips after mixing 10 μl of PCR product with 2 μl 6x loading dye. Include 5 μl of GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA ladder. We recommend leaving empty wells between each sample or ladder-containing lane in case there is any accidental spillover from one well into the other, which could confound interpretation between adjacent samples. Run the gel until the dye front is 2/3 down the gel. Stain gel using Ethidium Bromide or other DNA stain. Image the DNA gel. An HPV specific amplicon is expected around 450 basepairs. A GAPDH specific amplicon is expected around 137 basepairs. BASIC PROTOCOL 1: Establishing human primary cell derived 3D organotypic raft cultures This protocol highlights the steps taken to generate a full-thickness 3D organotypic raft tissue. First, we establish a dermal equivalent containing collagen and fibroblasts. A basal layer of keratinocytes (HPV-positive or negative) is seeded onto this dermal equivalent. Finally, we will lift these rafts to the air-liquid interface and allow the tissue to differentiate for several weeks. We will show examples of human foreskin, human cervical, and human tonsillar epithelia. The cervical cells were infected with HPV18 before starting the differentiation process. We will demonstrate that, despite using the same method, the organotypic tissues display features reminiscent of the original tissue. Materials Reagents, solutions, and cell lines Human fibroblasts hTERT immortalized (e.g., HFF-hTERT RRID:CVCL_VC40). Alternatively, can use mouse J2/3T3 or primary human fibroblasts, either foreskin-derived or from origin site being modeled Primary human epithelial cells isolated in Support Protocol 1 Fibroblast growth media (see recipe) 10x Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution with phenol red (Sigma, cat. no.

PICM0RG50) Sterile forceps Sterile microspatulas (such as Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 21-401-10) Parafilm −80°C freezer Protocol steps This protocol will generate 12 medium-sized (Jackson et al., 2019) 3D organotypic raft tissues, which contract over time from their initial diameter of ~10 mm to ~5 mm Day #1 – Prepare dermal equivalents 1Propagate and harvest human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF-tert) cells Viability should exceed 90% by Trypan blue exclusion Protocol requires 80,000 cells per raft (A total of 960,000 fibroblasts for this protocol) 2Pellet the cells by centrifugation (7 min, 150 × g) 3Resuspend in 960 μl cold FBS (1 × 106 cells/ml) 4Prepare dermal mixture by combining: 3.75 ml collagen 0.5 ml Hanks medium dropwise add 22.5 μl of 4M NaOH (We recommend adding this in 2.5 μl increments) 960 μl fibroblast/FBS, mix carefully with pipette and swirling tube by hand It is critical that this is performed in a pre-cooled (−20°C freezer) 50 ml conical tube that is stored on ice. Ensure that the collagen is neutralized prior to adding the fibroblast cells Do not introduce air bubbles 5Seed 400 μl of dermal mixture per well into 12 wells of a pre-labelled 48 well plate. Check under microscope to confirm all dermal equivalents have homogenous fibroblasts 6Incubate in 37°C 5% CO2 incubator for 20 min to solidify. Confirm that the dermal equivalents turn opaque. 7Carefully add 400 μl fibroblast growth media to each raft, along the side of the well. 8Incubate overnight (~16–18 hrs) at 37°C, 5% CO2 Day #2 – Seed basal keratinocyte layer 9Check dermal equivalents from Day #1 Confirm that the fibroblasts are homogeneously distributed throughout the dermis and that they appear viable and elongated. Confirm the color of the dermal equivalents: should be a little more acidic, from pinkish red to peachy orange, and free of contaminants. Confirm integrity of the dermal equivalents: should all be intact, adhered to the bottom of the well, with no obvious air bubbles 10Harvest the keratinocytes as per Support Protocol 2 (Steps 6 to 13). The protocol needs 250k cells for each medium-sized raft. 11Remove liquid from atop the dermal equivalents with aspiration initially (taking care not to get too close to the layer) and a pipettor to remove any remaining liquid. 12Resuspend keratinocytes to 250k/50 μl keratinocyte growth media. 13Deposit mixed keratinocytes drop-wise on top of dermal equivalents, then rock back and forth side to side front to back, and angle in each direction to distribute. Check that keratinocytes are evenly distributed under the microscope. You should be able to focus through the dermal layer and see the basal keratinocytes seeded on top 14Incubate cells 2 hr at 37°C 5% CO2 to allow initial adherence of this basal keratinocyte layer 15Check under microscope for adherence Should not observe too many floating cells if you move the plate gently to check. 16Carefully/slowly add 400 μl F-media, moving around the edge of the well in a circular motion, so that loosely adherence cells won’t be washed to one side. Check by microscope to ensure that no obvious detachment of cells has occurred. 17Incubate overnight at 37°C 5% CO2 Day #3 – Lifting to the air-liquid interface Proceed with lifting ~24 hours post-seeding of the keratinocytes 18Observe the 48-well plate cultures by microscope. Ensure that the basal layer of the raft tissue appears attached and 100% confluent. Confirm the fibroblasts are still homogeneously distributed and viable, with elongated phenotype. Media should be peachy-yellow, given proliferation of the basal keratinocytes as they become 100% confluent on-top of the dermal equivalent (pink media indicates that cells were likely not viable, or incorrect pH at time of seeding; peachy-yellow (with turbidity) could also be a sign of contamination. Submerged cultures should appear intact: cylindrical and fully adhered to the bottom of the wells. 19Pre-label 6-well plate as per experimental design. 20Aliquot exactly 1.1 ml of 37°C differentiation media into the wells of the 6-well plate. Ensure that the media completely covers the bottom surface of each well. 21Using sterile forceps, place membrane inserts into the media-filled wells of the 6-well plate: lower into the well at a slight angle, so that the bottom surface of the membrane contacts the media at one end and fully wets the bottom of the membrane evenly as you lower it in. Rotate the filter in the media-filled wells until the filters are fully wet. Critical: These membranes are hydrophobic and are difficult to wet. If bubbles form underneath the membrane, lift them on an angle with forceps and use the side of a sterile pipette tip to displace any bubbles, taking care not to puncture the membrane, before placing them back in flat. 22In the 48-well plate, carefully remove F-media from the submerged cultures (dermal equivalent with basal layer of keratinocytes on top) by holding the plate on an angle and using a pipette (1000 μl, then 200 μl) to remove the liquid without disturbing the culture. 23Loosen the rafts within the well by sliding a 200 μl pipette tip carefully around the outside edge. 24Use sterile rounded end scoops to transfer rafts from the 48-well plate to the top of the membrane inserts in the 6-well plate. Two medium-sized rafts can fit on a 6-well membrane insert. Ensure they are not touching each other or the plastic edge of the membrane. Take care to ensure the keratinocyte side stays up, and you do not pinch or crush the rafts. This process takes careful fine-motor skills. 25Remove excess liquid that builds up around the rafts on top the membrane shortly after lifting. 26Incubate rafts at 37°C 5% CO2 for 20 min, then remove any additional excess liquid that builds up around the rafts, and ensure the rafts are well-positioned and not touching each other or overlapping the edge of the membrane. Gently move them if needed with a 200 μl pipette tip. 27Incubate 37°C 5% CO2 for the duration of the rafting experiment (1 to 3 weeks, typically 2 weeks), changing media every 48 hours. Media changes 28After 48 hours, aspirate media from 6-well plates using a pipette along the side of the well, being careful not to flip the membrane insert or disrupt the rafts. 29Add exactly 1.1 ml total of differentiation media to the side of the well, so it spreads underneath the membrane. If bubbles form under the membrane, or the media doesn’t fully cover the bottom, use a sterile pipette tip to rotate the membrane insert so bubbles are pushed to the side and the membrane is fully contacting the media 30Once the rafts are ready to harvest, with 2 weeks typically sufficient for full epithelial stratification, they can be processed for downstream analyses. Tissue collection for histology 31Use a microspatula or forceps to carefully transfer the entire raft into 500 μl of 10% buffered formalin within a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 32Incubate the raft tissue for 24 hours at room temperature to allow the fixative to permeate. 33Remove the formalin and gently wash the raft twice with 500 μl 70% ethanol 34Store in 500 μl 70% ethanol at room temperature until ready for histological processing. Proceed with the histological processing as soon as possible, within a few weeks at maximum) To minimize evaporation of the 70% ethanol, seal the 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes with parafilm The rafts should be bisected and embedded in paraffin so that a clear cross-section of the strata is visible. Tissue collection for molecular processing 35Separate the epidermal layer from the dermis (collagen and fibroblasts). Use two sets of sterile forceps (one to hold the raft in place, and the other to grab an edge of the epidermis) and peel off the epidermis of the dermis. Transfer the epidermal compartment and the dermal compartment to separate 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Flash-freeze the tissues by suspending in liquid nitrogen Store frozen tissues at −80°C. Photographs of the rafting process are shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3. Open in a new tab 3D organotypic raft culturing process. Rafts are prepared over an initial period of 3 days, Day 1 prepare the dermal equivalent (see photograph above of the solidified collagen-fibroblast mixture in a 48-well plate). On Day 2 the basal layer of keratinocytes is seeded atop the dermal equivalent containing active fibroblasts (note the pH color change from reddish pink to peachy orange). On Day 3 the cultures are lifted to the air-liquid interface (see photograph depicting rafts on their membranes within a 6-well plate). These lifted rafts are cultured for two weeks, changing media every 48 hrs (see photograph, depicting the rafts with visual opacity due to differentiation and stratification). Note that the rafts contract during growth (compare diameter of raft at time of lifting vs. at harvest) SUPPORT PROTOCOL 4: Growth and maintenance of human A2EN cells as monolayer culture We use human, cervical A2EN cells to seed the rotating wall vessel bioreactors and generate the 3D cervical epithelial cell model.

Resuspend cells in 5 ml pre-warmed complete KFSM medium. Transfer cells to a T25 25 cm2 flask. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2. Monitor daily by light microscopy and change medium every 2–3 days until cells reach 90–95% confluency. Remove and discard spent culture medium. Detach monolayer A2EN cells by treatment with 0.5 ml 0.5% trypsin-EDTA solution at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5–10 minutes. Suspend A2EN cells in 9.5 ml neutralization medium and transfer to a sterile 15 ml conical tube. Harvest cells by centrifugation (see step 3). Discard supernatant and resuspend A2EN cells in 10 ml pre-warmed complete KFSM medium. Subculture A2EN cells into a T75 cm2 flask and add 5 ml complete KFSM medium to a final volume of 15 ml. Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2. Subculture A2EN monolayer cells every 2–3 days by repeating step 6. When A2EN monolayer cells reach 90–95% confluency, detach, harvest, and resuspend A2EN cells according to step 6. Transfer A2EN cells into a T150 cm2 flask and adjust to 25 ml with pre-warmed complete KFSM medium. Continue incubating at 37°C, 5% CO2 until A2EN monolayer cells reach 90–95% confluency.

Decontaminate the STLV bioreactor by filling with 70% (v/v) ethanol through the central port. Seal the central port with the provided plug and incubate overnight at room temperature. Remove ethanol and repeat overnight incubation in 70% ethanol. Remove ethanol and fill STLV bioreactor with sterile ddH2O. Incubate overnight at room temperature. Remove ddH2O and repeat overnight incubation in fresh sterile ddH2O. Remove ddH2O. Remove the central port and wrap in aluminum foil. Loosen STLV bioreactor unit screws using the tool provided by the vendor. Place wrapped central port and STLV bioreactor unit in a sterilization pouch. Autoclave at 110°C for 20 minutes and allow the unit to cool. Tighten screws and attach the sterile one-way stop cocks to each side port. SUPPORT PROTOCOL 6: Preparing the cytodex-3 microcarrier beads During suspension growth inside the slow-turning lateral vessel bioreactor, the epithelial cells will attach to and grow on Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads allowing the cells to grow under physiologically relevant low fluid‐shear conditions. This protocol describes the steps taken to prepare the Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads before culturing cells within the RWV bioreactor. Materials Reagents, solutions, and cell lines Sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered solution, 1X (Fisher Scientific, cat. no. MT21031CV) Neutralization medium (see recipe) Gibco Keratinocyte serum-free medium (1X), without calcium chloride (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 37010022) Hardware and instruments Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. C3275–10G) Autoclave sterilizer Protocol steps Add 300 mg of Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads to a 50 ml conical tube containing 25 ml D-PBS. Incubate overnight at room temperature to allow beads to hydrate. Autoclave beads at 110°C for 20 min. Allow beads to cool to room temperature. Ensure the tube remains in upright position during hydration and autoclaving to prevent microcarrier beads from adhering to the tube walls above the liquid-air interface. Wall-adherent microcarrier beads will decrease the ability of cells to form 3D cellular aggregates. Hydrated and autoclaved Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads in D-PBS may be stored up to one week at room temperature. Allow beads to settle to the bottom of the tube and remove the upper layer of D-PBS. Wash beads with 25 ml neutralization medium. Allow beads to settle and remove and discard the neutralization medium. Repeat wash procedure with 25 ml neutralization medium and allow beads to settle. Remove and discard the neutralization medium. Wash beads with 25 ml complete KFSM medium. Allow beads to settle and repeat wash with 10 ml complete KFSM medium. Use immediately for seeding and differentiating 3D human cervical cells in the rotating wall vessel bioreactor (see Basic Protocol 2) BASIC PROTOCOL 2: Establishing human 3D cervical tissues using the rotating wall vessel bioreactor This protocol describes a method to generate physiologically relevant 3D tissues using innovative rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Inside the RWV bioreactor, cells experience low physiological fluid shear conditions. The bioreactors come in two different formats, a high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV) or a slow-turning lateral vessel (STLV), in which they differ by their aeration source. Epithelial cells are mixed with collagen coated microbeads and added to the bioreactor. Following differentiation, the tissues can be harvested and used to study host-pathogen interactions. We provide details on how to culture HPV E6 and E7 immortalized, human cervical A2EN cells. However, with minor modifications, these methods can be used to create several three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models (i.e., vagina, gastrointestinal, lung, colon, placental, and neuronal) that exhibit physiologically relevant features observed in vivo (Carterson et al., 2005; Hjelm et al., 2010; Höner zu Bentrup et al., 2006; LaMarca et al., 2005; Myers et al., 2008; Nickerson et al., 2001). The RWV bioreactor cell culture system provides a low fluid shear microenvironment that enables cells to form 3D cellular aggregates with in vivo-like characteristics, including tight junctions, mucin production, extracellular processes (i.e. microvilli), and cellular polarity.

This protocol is estimated to generate ~36 1 ml aliquots in two 24-well plates. 1. Detach human A2EN cervical epithelial cells cultured as monolayers from Support Protocol 4 by trypsinization as outlined in Support Protocol 4 and resuspend in 10 ml prewarmed complete KFSM medium. Add 10 μl of the cell suspension to a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 μl 0.4% trypan blue solution and mix gently by pipetting. Enumerate live cells by trypan blue exclusion staining. 2. Add 1×107 viable cells to the conical tube containing the prepared Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads. Carefully pour the A2EN cells and microcarrier beads into the STLV bioreactor through the central port. Seal the central port with the provided plug and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 without rotation for 1 hour to allow A2EN cells to adhere to beads. 3. Remove plungers from the sterile syringes and resleeve plungers in their plastic wrapper to maintain sterility. Attach one 5 ml and one 10 ml syringe to the one-way stop cocks. 4. Open both stop cocks and fill the STLV bioreactor with complete KFSM medium through the 10 ml syringe. 5. Close the 5 ml syringe stop cock when the medium begins to flow into the syringe port. Continue filling with complete KFSM medium to the 10 ml syringe line. Insert both plungers and remove bubbles. It is important to ensure all bubbles are removed from the medium within the STLV to avoid mechanical shearing of the cells from the bead surface and to promote 3D A2EN cellular aggregate formation. 6. Attach the STLV bioreactor to the rotator unit housed inside a 37°C incubator. Turn on the power and adjust the rotational speed to 20 rpm. 5. Allow the STLV bioreactor to incubate at 37°C, 20 rpm for three days without changing the culture medium. Remove bubbles daily to maximize cell attachment to microcarrier beads and minimize disruption of 3D cellular aggregate formation. 6. On the fourth day of incubation, replace the spent culture medium from the STLV bioreactor. Open the stop cocks and remove both syringe plungers. Tilt the STLV bioreactor so the 10 ml syringe side is at an ~45° angle and allow the 3D cell aggregates to settle in the corner. Use a sterile 10 ml serological pipette attached to an automatic pipettor, to slowly aspirate and discard 40 ml of the spent culture medium. Avoid removing the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. 7. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes. Remove plungers and resleeve in their plastic wrapper to maintain sterility. Replace old syringes with new syringes. 8. Fill STLV bioreactor with fresh, prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in steps 4–5 above. 9. Reattach the STLV bioreactor to the rotating unit and resume incubation at 37°C, 20 rpm. The bioreactor must be incubated with continuous rotation, except when replacing culture medium and transferring 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the disposable HARV. 10. Replace the culture medium every other day until day 10; after day 10, replace culture medium daily until day 28 of incubation. 11. Monitor development of the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates on a weekly basis by removing ~0.2 ml of resuspended A2EN cellular aggregates from the central port using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette tip. Place 3D A2EN cellular aggregates in a small petri dish containing 0.5–1 ml of medium and visualize using an inverted light microscope. 12. After 21 days of incubation in the STLV bioreactor, unpackage a sterile disposable HARV bioreactor and remove the central plug. 12. Decontaminate the STLV surface with 70% ethanol and dry thoroughly. 13. Aspirate and discard 30 ml of spent culture medium from the STLV bioreactor. 14. Remove the central port plug and gently swirl the STLV bioreactor to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. 15. Carefully pour the mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. 16. Aspirate and discard ~10 ml of the upper supernatant layer. Gently swirl the 50 ml conical tube to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. 17. Using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette, carefully transfer the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the disposable HARV bioreactor through the central port. 18. Collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates by rinsing the 50 ml conical tube walls with 10 ml of fresh prewarmed complete KFSM medium. Transfer residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to the HARV bioreactor and replace the central plug. 19. Unpackage new 5 ml and 10 ml syringes and remove plungers. Resleeve plungers in their plastic wrappers to maintain sterility. Attach syringes to the disposable HARV built-in stop cocks. Fill with prewarmed complete KFSM medium, as outlined in steps 4–5 above. It is important to ensure all bubbles are removed from the medium within the STLV to avoid mechanical shearing of the cells from the bead surface and to promote 3D A2EN cellular aggregate formation. 20. Attach the disposable HARV bioreactor to the rotator unit and incubate at 37°C, 20 rpm for 7 additional days. Replace medium daily, as outlined in step 4–5 above. 21. The 3D human A2EN cellular aggregates are ready to harvest for downstream experimentation on day 28 of incubation. 22. Remove syringe plungers and aspirate and discard ~30 ml of culture medium. Remove the central port from the HARV bioreactor, gently swirl to resuspend the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates, and carefully pour mixture into a sterile 50 ml conical tube. 23. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. Aspirate 10 ml of the top layer of culture medium and add to the disposable HARV bioreactor. 24. Gently swirl the disposable HARV to collect residual 3D A2EN cellular aggregates and carefully pour into the 50 ml conical tube to pool the samples. 25. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. 26. Aspirate and discard the top layer of culture medium. Perform all remaining steps with KFSM medium without Primocin added. 27. Wash 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 15 ml of KFSM medium without Primocin. Gently swirl tube to ensure 3D A2EN aggregates are thoroughly washed. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. 28. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of medium. Repeat rinse with ~40 ml of KFSM medium lacking Primocin. Allow 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. 29. Swirl 50 ml conical tube to thoroughly resuspend 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Using a wide-bore 1000 μl pipette tip, aliquot 1 ml samples into a sterile 24-well tissue-treated culture plate. It is important to thoroughly resuspend 3D cellular aggregates before each 1 ml aliquot to ensure 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are evenly partitioned amongst the 24-well plate. 30. Halfway through the aliquot process (after transferring to 18 wells), transfer 1 ml of 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for enumerating 3D A2EN cells by trypan blue exclusion. 31. Incubate the 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37°C and continue aliquoting 3D A2EN cellular aggregates into the remaining wells of both 24-well plates. When complete, incubate both 24-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO2. 32. The 3D A2EN cellular aggregates are now ready to be used for downstream assays. 33. To count the cells, aspirate and discard the upper layer of culture medium from the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 3D A2EN cellular aggregates from step 30. Avoid transferring the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. Wash the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 1 ml of sterile D-PBS pre-warmed to 37°C. Allow the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates to settle. 34. Aspirate and discard the upper layer of D-PBS, being careful not to remove the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates. 35. Treat the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates with 300 μl of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA to dissociate the 3D A2EN cells from the microcarrier bead matrix. Invert the tube several times to mix thoroughly. Incubate the 3D A2EN cellular aggregates at 37°C for 10 minutes with periodic inversion to promote detachment. The beads will progressively look like “particles of sand” as the 3D A2EN cells dissociate from the microcarrier beads with continued incubation in the trypsin-EDTA solution. 36. Add pre-warmed neutralization medium to the 1.5 ml microfuge tube to the 1 ml gradient line (~500–600 μl). Mix thoroughly by inverting the tube several times. Allow the microcarrier beads to settle. 37. Aspirate 10 μl of the A2EN cell-containing supernatant into a sterile 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution and gently mix by pipetting. Enumerate viable cells using an automated cell counter (e.g., Invitrogen Countess) or manually using a hemocytometer, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 38. Utilize 3D A2EN cellular aggregates incubating in the 24-well plates for downstream experimental analysis. A workflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells is shown in Fig. 4. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Workflow diagram for generating 3D A2EN cells using RWV bioreactor technology. Downstream experimental procedures for utilizing 3D A2EN cells includes, but is not limited to, infection with bacteria or viruses, investigating compound cytotoxicity, and ultrastructural imaging using scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. BASIC PROTOCOL 3: Histological assessment of 3D organotypic raft tissues The methods outlined in Basic Protocol 1 aim to generate tissues that accurately represent the original tissue. Routine histological assessment on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections usually involves staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This allows for visualization of organotypic cultures. Comparison with known tissues, e.g., through the Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org, see the Normal Tissue Histology section of the Dictionary; Uhlén et al., 2005), will allow for comparison between the organotypic tissues and their in vivo counterparts. Finally, histological assessment can be the first step in observing any morphological changes related to your experiment. Methods for tissue embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining are beyond the scope of this protocol. We provide details on methods that will allow the reader to identify epithelial strata in their cultures, compare these structures to genuine tissues, and ultimately determine the success of their raft cultures. Materials H&E stained slides with permanently mounted coverslip (rafts should be cut in half, bisected, and embedded so that the open faces are orientated to allow a cross-sectional view of the epithelium, 4 μm thickness, two sections per slide) Microscope with color cameraProtocol Steps Observe the entire epithelium for each tissue piece for histological features. Ensure that the two major compartments are present: dermis (or stroma) and epidermis (or epithelium, proper). The dermis should appear light pink (eosin-stained collagen fibers) with sporadic dark purple/blue, haematoxylin-stained fibroblast nuclei. Observe the clear distinction between the dermal compartment and the epidermis (darker pink, more nuclei, stratified keratinocytes). The epidermis of full-thickness stratified squamous epithelium should consist of a basal layer of proliferating keratinocytes (stratum basale), with a basement membrane dividing this layer from the dermis. Cells above the basal layer are referred to as “suprabasal” and comprise several strata making up an intermediate “midzone” and then at the top a “superficial” layer. The cells immediately above the basal layer are referred to as “parabasal”, whereas the majority of midzone cells make up the stratum spinosum. Above the spinous layer is a thin granular layer (stratum granulosum) and then the stratum lucidum and finally the stratum corneum (which is predominantly present in keratinizing epithelia, like cutaneous skin, making up the uppermost and most differentiated superficial cells, and absent or only partially present in non-keratinizing mucosal epithelia, like tonsillar or ectocervical tissue. Occasionally upper layers of the epidermis, or even the entire epidermis itself, can detach during raft harvesting or tissue processing. These pieces may still be stained and observable, so if you see only dermis in the main tissue piece make sure you look around the area (at low magnification, like 10x) to see if the epidermal compartment is nearby. Example histology data are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Histological microscope images of 3D organotypic epithelia. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained cross-sections of 3D rafts grown from (A) HPV18 negative (top) and positive (bottom) human cervical keratinocytes and (B) human tonsillar keratinocytes clearly show stratified squamous epithelial structure. Different layers of the organotypic epithelia are marked with arrows. BASIC PROTOCOL 4: Spatial analysis of protein expression in 3D organotypic raft cultures While H&E stained tissues provide a general idea of the histological features of these 3D cultures (Basic Protocol 3), this stain does not provide data on specific proteins that have unique expression patterns between different tissues, spatially according to the differentiation state of the tissue, or dysregulated as a result of viral activities. This protocol provides methods to characterize target proteins in 3D raft tissue using immunofluorescence on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. The conditions used here work for detecting differentiation (e.g., keratins) and viral life cycle related markers (e.g., dysregulated cell cycle proteins, such as p16), but the reader should keep in mind that conditions (e.g., as antigen-retrieval, blocking buffer composition, and antibody dilutions) may need to be optimized for a specific target of interests.

Specific antigens may require optimal antigen-retrieval buffers. Often, this information is available in datasheets but otherwise needs to be determined experimentally. 5Incubate the slides in a steamer for 30 min (preset 5 of 7), then allow to cool for 20 min. Other epitope retrieval methods are likely appropriate but will need to be optimized to maximize signal to background for desired antigen using appropriate controls. 6Rinse slides twice in ddH2O. Ensure that excess liquid is removed. 7Draw hydrophobic circles around tissue sections using a barrier pen or wax pencil 8Rinse the slide in 1x PBS. 9Incubate the slides in 2% BSA/PBS block for 30 minutes. Ensure enough volume to fully cover the tissue section (with tightly drawn hydrophobic circles around typical bisected raft tissue we find 100 μl enough to cover). If needed, rotate the slide to ensure the drop fills the entire tissue section, gently tap while rotating if needed, ensuring the volume doesn’t leak past the barrier (if it does, add additional volume). If you’re having issues with tissue sections not being fully covered: add a surfactant such as Tween-20 (0.05% final concentration) to your buffers and diluents, which will help break the surface tension and allow tissue sections to be fully covered. (Addition of detergent may affect the staining). In our hands, a 2% BSA/PBS block is sufficient in most cases, but consider a normal sera block if you are observing high background due to non-specific secondary antibody binding. 10Dilute the primary antibody at appropriate dilution/concentration (1:100, 2 μg/ml final concentration, for both anti-KRT10 and anti-p16), in the blocking buffer (e.g., 2% BSA/PBS). 11Shake off blocking buffer. Carefully place the slides flat in a humidified staining chamber and add 100 μl diluted primary antibody. Include a no-primary antibody control (blocking buffer only) for assessing non-specific secondary antibody signal. Incubate overnight in the fridge at 4°C.

Ensure that excess liquid is removed, but do not dry completely. 20Mount w/ DAPI-containing mounting media, one drop per section (~25 μl), enough to cover tissue area. 21Coverslip with 1.5 thickness coverglass 22×50 full-length, ensure no bubbles. Coverslip can be removed if needed by placing the slide in a Coplin jar containing 1x PBS and letting the coverslip fall off naturally, so tissue is not damaged. 22Store slides protected from light and allow curing mountant to cure. 23Store slides at 4°C or room temp afterward, depending on the mountant used. 24Image slides using a fluorescence microscope. Example immunofluorescence data are shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Immunofluorescence images of 3D organotypic rafts depicting protein-level confirmation of (A, B) differentiation marker keratin 10 (KRT10) and (C) HPV-induced host cell cycle dysregulation marker p16INK4A. In panel A, KRT10 (red cytoplasmic signal) is expressed in suprabasal differentiated cells, in only the uppermost layers in cervical and tonsillar-derived 3D rafts, compared to all suprabasal cells in foreskin-derived 3D rafts as a control. The white dotted line indicates the transition from dermis to epidermis. Differential staining of cytokeratins highlights the differences between tissues derived from unique anatomic sites, such as non-keratinizing epithelium of the oral mucosa and cervix compared to keratinizing epithelium of the foreskin. Importantly, Basic Protocol 1 yields 3D organotypic raft tissues that resemble the anatomic site of origin dependent on the primary keratinocytes used. Reference images are from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, available from http://www.proteinatlas.org, Uhlén et al., 2005) with immunohistochemical stain (DAB, brown) for KRT10 (ENSG00000186395): normal skin tissue (T-01000, Skin 1, CAB000132, Male, age 63, Patient id: 2418), normal cervical tissue (T-83000, HPA012014, Female, age 37, Patient id: 4504), and normal tonsil tissue (T-61100, CAB000132, Male, age 31, Patient id: 2511). An enlarged view of KRT10-stained tonsillar raft tissue is shown in panel B, corresponding to the white-dotted box. In panel C, p16INK4A (red) is over-expressed in HPV-positive tissues, with stronger and more diffuse cytoplasmic staining as a signature of HPV-induced changes within host cells. Cell nuclei are DAPI-stained (blue) and the basal layer of keratinocytes are visually separated from the underlying dermis (containing fibroblasts embedded in collagen) by a white-dotted line.

This approach allows for the unbiased visualization of surface characteristics and secretory vesicles/mucus deposits between adjacent cells and on the apical cell surface. These methods provide further characterization of the 3D models.

SUPPORT PROTOCOL 7: RNA extraction from 3D tissues These methods are optimized to extract total cellular (and viral) RNA from these 3D tissues (Basic Protocols 1 and 2). This RNA can be used to detect cellular and viral transcripts by qPCR (Basic Protocol 7) or used for transcriptomic analysis. Since the entire tissue is lysed, the gene expression profile will aggregate the different differentiated layers of tissue.

Grind the tissue into a powder by rotating and moving a pre-cooled micro pestle up and down in the tube. Ensure that the contents do not spill out and are kept frozen with liquid nitrogen (re-submerge the bottom of the tube as needed). It is important to ensure that the tissue is disrupted as quickly as possible while being kept cool, to avoid RNA degradation by RNases. Add lysis buffer as soon as the tissue is sufficiently disrupted (powder-like). Rotating wall vessel tissue (Basic Protocol 2) Wash tissue with 500 μl PBS Add 200 μl PBS to the tissue Homogenize tissue by passing it through a 20-gauge followed by a 25-gauge needle Critical. Do not transfer beads to the spin column (beads will clog column membrane resulting in low RNA yield) Add 700 μl lysis buffer (containing 1 % beta-mercaptoethanol) from the RNeasy Mini Kit. Rinse the micro pestle and sides of the tube with this lysis buffer when using epithelial raft tissue mechanically disrupted by grinding. Vortex the lysate for 10 sec. Ensure complete homogenization. If any tissue fragments are still visible then use a 20g followed by a 25g needle and syringe to further homogenize this mixture and aid lysis. Load 700 μl onto a QIAshredder column and centrifuge at maximum speed. Follow the RNeasy Mini Kit procedure to bind, wash, and elute RNA. We elute with 50 μl pre-warmed (56°C) nuclease-free water. Remove DNA from eluate using the Turbo-free DNase kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantify the RNA concentration and purity spectrophotometrically. Proceed with reverse transcription immediately, keeping the RNA on ice, or store the RNA at −80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as this could lead to degradation. BASIC PROTOCOL 7: Characterization of gene expression by RT-qPCR The RNA isolated in Support Protocol 6 can be used to detect cellular and viral transcripts by qPCR. Here we provide an example to quantify the expression of HPV18 L1 mRNA. The L1 gene is expressed in differentiated cells, and is a marker for the switch to late viral gene expression and, presumably, virion assembly. Other viral and cellular genes can be quantified using different primer sets. The expression of many human ‘housekeeping’ genes changes throughout cellular differentiation (Steele et al., 2002). We detect the human PPIA (Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A) gene as a reference. Since the entire tissue is lysed, the gene expression profile will aggregate the different layers of tissue.

A2411–250MG) COMMENTARY BACKGROUND INFORMATION The papillomavirus life cycle is intricately linked to the differentiation status of the infected tissue and cells. Therefore, the complex papillomavirus replicative cycle has been difficult to recapitulate in the laboratory. To decipher the fundamental biology of HPVs, it is essential to recapitulate the 3D structure of these tissues. Furthermore, epidemiological data strongly suggest that the nature of the infected tissue (i.e., cervix or tonsillar crypts) plays a critical role in how HPV interacts with the host (Doorbar & Griffin, 2019; Roberts et al., 2019). This protocol provides complementary methods to establish 3D organotypic tissues representing cervical and oral epithelia. Unlike conventional monolayer cultures, both organotypic raft cultures and RWV-derived human 3D tissues recapitulate physiological architecture, such as apical and basal cell polarity, and ultrastructural features (Asselineau & Prunieras, 1984; Kopan et al., 1987; Radtke et al., 2012; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012). Organotypic raft cultures (named due to the apparent floating nature of the cell-matrix) have been critical in deciphering different aspects of the HPV life cycle. These methods were initially developed to study skin biology and skin grafting research (Bell et al., 1983; Rheinwald & Green, 1975a), and were later adapted to study HPV. The complete life cycle of a human papillomavirus (HPV) was first elucidated in this culture system (Dollard et al., 1992; McCance et al., 1988; Meyers et al., 1992). In addition to the current protocol, other, excellent organotypic raft protocols have been published and used (Anacker & Moody, 2012; Lambert et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2016; Ozbun & Patterson, 2014; Roberts et al., 2019). The ability to establish these 3D organotypic raft cultures from diverse human tissues will allow researchers to study how HPV (or other pathogens) interact with these physiologically relevant tissues. Indeed, we demonstrate that once isolated, these cells maintain properties reminiscent of the initial tissue. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology was developed by NASA in the 1990’s to study the impact of low fluid-shear modeled microgravity environment and this methodology was found to promote cellular differentiation and faithfully recapitulate features of human tissue (Unsworth & Lelkes, 1998). Cells are cultured with microcarrier beads providing an extracellular matrix for cells to attach within the low fluid-shear environment using RWV bioreactor thereby promoting cellular differentiation and formation of 3D tissue aggregates (Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016). This culture methodology has been utilized to generate organotypic epithelial tissues from a wide variety of sites that recapitulate the in vivo architecture, barrier function, secretion of mucins, apical-basolateral polarity and transcriptional programs of in vivo tissue as reviewed extensively (Barrila et al., 2010; Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016). Furthermore, the 3D RWV-derived organotypic tissues have also been utilized to study a plethora of host-microbe interactions, including throughout the female reproductive tract (Barrila et al., 2010, 2018; Crabbé et al., 2017; Drummond et al., 2016; Gardner & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2016, 2018; Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016; Ilhan et al., 2020; Łaniewski et al., 2017; Nickerson et al., 2001; Sainz et al., 2009). It is becoming increasingly clear that 3D RVW-derived organoids provide researchers with advanced in vitro model systems that better resemble human in vivo tissue equivalents and are desirable when suitable animal models of infection are lacking or to complement other existing model systems. There is currently no animal model that adequately mimics the human Lactobacillus-dominated cervicovaginal microenvironment (Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2016; Witkin & Ledger, 2012). Human cervical and vaginal lines derived from explanted tissues suffer from a finite life span and conventional 2D monolayer cultures fail to exhibit features of their parental in vivo tissue. The 3D RWV-derived A2EN cervical cells, on the other hand, faithfully recapitulate cellular phenotypes of in vivo tissue, such as apical and basal cellular polarity, microvilli, mucin secretion, and intracellular tight junctions (Radtke et al., 2012; Radtke & Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012). Human A2EN cervical cells are immortalized by stable transfection with the HPV E6 and E7 proteins, therefore providing long-term replicative capacity (Herbst-Kralovetz et al., 2008). Additionally, 3D A2EN cervical models have been colonized effectively with Lactobacillus spp. and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, exposed to microbial products and challenged with pathogens and found to recapitulate clinical features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (Gardner et al., 2020; McGowin et al., 2013; Radtke et al., 2012; Winkle et al., 2016). Therefore, 3D RWV-derived cervical cell models described in these protocols may allow researchers to study how genital bacteria and pathogens of the cervicovaginal microenvironment influence the HPV lifecycle. In conclusion, we provide detailed protocols on establishing and analyzing 3D tissues to study the interactions between HPV and its specific host tissues.CRITICAL PARAMETERS A successful 3D organotypic raft culture experiment requires healthy, proliferative cells. Furthermore, it is critical that researchers adhere to the stepwise process of building and lifting the rafts. Finally, these raft tissues are fragile, and careful handling throughout is essential. Both the fibroblasts and keratinocytes need to be viable to function properly for the duration of the raft procedure and should be proliferative without showing signs of senescence or transformation prior to initiating rafts. It is also critical that the appropriate media are used during each step of the procedure: EGF-containing F-media (with or without ROCK inhibition) when the basal keratinocytes are seeded. A switch to differentiation media (calcium-supplemented, without EGF and no ROCK inhibitor) is made once the tissues are lifted to the air-liquid interface. Each step of the raft process requires careful handling. When seeding the dermal equivalents you must work quickly, before the collagen-mixture solidifies, while avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. When lifting the rafts onto membranes you must take care not to break, drop, or place the cultures upside down. With regard to the 3D RWV bioreactor-derived model system one should consider the initial set up cost of purchase the RWV bioreactor system (RLSS-4, power source, etc) and the time investment to generate fully differentiated 3D aggregates (28 days). The most critical parameters include the preparation of the beads and bioreactor, growth and health of the cells and appropriate seeding of the bioreactor. Additional parameters include close monitoring and maintenance of cells over the 28 day period. Bioreactors require media to be changed daily after a point in the protocol when the cells are consuming the nutrients as indicated by a color change in media. Following media changes, one must ensure that there are no bubbles in the bioreactor. These bubbles are removed carefully from the ports and the elimination of these bubbles are extremely important for aggregate formation. In addition, the rotation must be maintained 24 hours a day except for when changing the media. Failure to turn the rotator back, prior to differentiation and harvest, will result in a ruined batch of aggregates.TROUBLESHOOTING See Table 1 for a list of common problems encountered when working with 3D tissue cultures, their possible causes, and our troubleshooting tips.

By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.INTRODUCTION Fluctuations in fluid shear are encountered by pathogenic microorganisms as they occupy various host sites throughout the course of infection and/or during colonization (46). This is especially true for the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which is able to adapt to and proliferate under a variety of environmental conditions, thus enabling high morbidity and mortality rates (32). The dissemination of S. aureus through a host exposes the organism to significant variations in fluid shear. For example, high levels of fluid shear (10 to 70 dynes/cm2) are encountered within the arterial blood vessels (41), whereas areas of low fluid shear could be experienced within the intestines (less than 5 dynes/cm2) (24). Studies on the impact of fluid shear on S. aureus have demonstrated that bacterial adherence is directly dependent on shear rate (44). Furthermore, in response to varied levels of fluid flux, variations on the staphylococcal cell have been investigated using flow chambers to determine changes in the presence of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, MSCRAMMs, which are involved in the ability of S. aureus to colonize (53). These investigations demonstrated that the S. aureus MSCRAMMs function in a shear-dependent manner, whereby the binding efficiency to host factors peaks under conditions of low fluid shear (50, 54). Previous investigations have also demonstrated the ability of S. aureus to sense and respond to fluid shear flux by altering biofilm architecture (31, 63). Specifically, studies of indwelling medical devices have indicated that S. aureus is an efficient biofilm former under various degrees of fluid shear (31, 63). The impact of fluid shear on staphylococcal biofilms has resulted in correlations between physiological levels of oscillatory shear stress and biofilm morphology and tolerance to antibiotics (31). Those investigations determined that the most turbulent flow conditions resulted in the thickest biofilm morphology and highest level of antibiotic resistance (31). Moreover, in response to fluid shear, the viscoelasticity of S. aureus biofilms permits them to remain attached yet undergo rolling migration, thereby promoting bacterial dispersal while remaining in the protected biofilm state (63). However, the role of low fluid shear levels, in relation to biofilm formation and downstream staphylococcal responses, is unclear. Approximately 60% of the human population intermittently carries S. aureus, with the highest isolation rates from the nasal pharynx (30). The isolation of S. aureus in stool samples and rectal sites is not uncommon, with previous studies demonstrating the presence of the same strain repeatedly isolated from the nose and stool samples/rectal sites of the same individuals over long periods of time (1, 15, 61), suggesting that the organism either repeatedly passes from the nose through the digestive system or maintains a long-term presence in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the passage through the gastrointestinal tract exposes S. aureus to various environmental conditions, including those present in the intestine. Cells within the intestine, both host epithelium and inhabiting microbes, are exposed to various levels of fluid shear (4). A bolus moving through the center of the lumen creates the highest shear level, which decreases with proximity toward the intestinal wall. The mucus layer provides a barrier that greatly reduces shear rates (55). It has been postulated that if the intestinal epithelial cells lacked microvilli, the fluid shear stress they would experience would be in the range of 1 to 5 dynes/cm2; however, the presence of microvilli further reduces the shear rates around these cells to less than 1 dyne/cm2 (24). The viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer itself provide protection for objects within the mucus from high shear rates (7). As a well-established intestinal colonizer (1, 8, 16, 28, 61) that adheres to intestinal mucus (70), S. aureus is exposed to the low fluid shear levels descriptive of this site. To facilitate studies in which planktonic microorganisms can be subjected to physiologically relevant levels of fluid shear, investigations have capitalized on the low-shear environment produced in NASA-designed rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, which were originally used as spaceflight analog cell culture systems (49). The RWV is a thin, cylindrical vessel (Fig. 1A) that, when completely filled with culture medium and rotated on an axis parallel to the ground, results in solid body rotation (49). Microorganisms in this environment are maintained in suspension (Fig. 1C) and experience a physiological low level of fluid shear over their cell surface, previously described as low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) (46, 49). Mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the fluid shear level within the RWV is less than 1 dyne/cm2 and that incremental increases in fluid shear levels in the RWV result in corresponding changes in the microbial response (46). As this level of fluid shear reflects the fluid shear levels previously described for the brush border of the intestine, the RWV has been proposed as a model for investigating the effects of low fluid shear levels that are similar to those in the intestine (3, 26, 47, 49, 58). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Operation of the RWV bioreactor (Synthecon, Houston, TX). (A) Image of the NASA-designed RWV apparatus used to create the LSMMG environment for bacterial culture. (B) The altered positioning of the RWV that results in the two culture orientations, depicting the axis of rotation. The LSMMG environment is achieved by rotation of the RWV on an axis parallel to the ground, whereas the axis of rotation in the control orientation is perpendicular to the ground. (C) Depiction of the orbital path of a cell when cultured in the LSMMG orientation. The continued combination of the sedimentation effect, whereby gravity and lack of motility cause a cell to settle to the bottom of the vessel, and the clockwise solid body rotation of the medium results in the continuous suspension of the cell in an orbit.The effects of the low-fluid-shear culture environment of the RWV on microbial responses have been most thoroughly documented for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Specifically, LSSMG culture enhanced the virulence of this organism in a murine model of infection, increased its stress resistance profiles, and induced global alterations in gene expression (48, 74). Moreover, it was found that the RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, was a major regulator of the LSMMG-induced molecular genetic response in S. Typhimurium (72). Hfq is a conserved global regulator that facilitates the binding of small regulatory RNAs with mRNAs to exert translational regulation in response to environmental stress (72). Subsequent studies have also identified a role for Hfq in regulating the LSMMG-induced response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14). Hfq and Hfq homologues are highly conserved across prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and have been connected to the stress response and virulence of many pathogens (68). In more recent studies, Rosado et al. investigated the culture of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in the low-fluid-shear environment of the RWV (62). No differences in growth profiles or MICs of various antibiotics were observed between LSMMG and control cultured S. aureus (62). However, those authors did report decreases in carotenoid production, alterations in red blood cell lysis, and the differential expression of two genes involved in metabolism and transport (62). A caveat for the study of pathogenic microorganisms is their ability to survive and adjust their virulence characteristics in response to rapidly changing, often extreme environmental conditions, including low fluid shear. However, there has been little investigation into the responses of S. aureus to the environmental conditions it encounters in vivo, where it rarely causes disease, for example, in the nasal pharynx, skin surface, and intestine. By investigating the mechanisms it utilizes to repress virulence at these sites, we can increase our understanding of the environmental triggers that lead to the initiation of virulence. The present studies were performed to determine the effect of low-fluid-shear culture on methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to elucidate impacts on cellular responses, such as biofilm formation, which has been postulated for many microorganisms in the intestines, where low-shear conditions exist (11, 24, 40). Furthermore, as multiple Gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to use Hfq as a common molecular response mechanism to low fluid shear (14, 72), we evaluated key regulators of the Gram-positive organism S. aureus to determine the potential of a universally conserved response(s) to this environmental parameter.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus N315 (kindly provided by Mark Shirtliff, University of Maryland Dental School) was used for all studies. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus 8325 (kindly provided by Naomi Balaban, Tufts University) was used in experiments as indicated. Prior to every experiment, S. aureus was taken from a frozen stock, inoculated into tryptic soy broth (TSB), and grown statically overnight. Aliquots of the culture were diluted (1:200) in fresh TSB and loaded into 50-ml RCCS-1 RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Houston, TX) in both the LSMMG orientation (Fig. 1B) and control orientations (Fig. 1B). Care was taken to ensure that no bubbles were present within the reactors, which could prevent disruption of the low-shear condition. The bioreactors were placed in a 37°C incubator and operated at 25 rpm for 20 h, at which point stationary phase was achieved.Growth profiles. S. aureus cultures were initiated in the RWV as described above. Following 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h of growth, a 1.5-ml aliquot was removed, using a 3-ml luer lock syringe, from sampling ports on the face of the RWV. For all time points greater than 10 h, the entire RWV culture volume was used for enumerating samples by removing and vigorously vortexing the contents of the vessels, to ensure dispersion of any aggregates that had formed during culture. Homogeneous dispersion was confirmed using light microscopy. For all time points, samples were enumerated using serial dilution with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) followed by overnight culture at 37°C. Growth curves were determined using a minimum of three separate cultures for each time point.ESEM imaging. Following 20 h of growth in the RWV, cultures of S. aureus N315 in the LSMMG orientation resulted in the presence of visible aggregates in the fluid phase of the vessel. The aggregates, as well as samples from the control vessel, were carefully removed from only the fluid phase of each vessel and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with filter-sterilized, deionized water by gentle inversion and then loaded onto silicon wafer chips on T stubs. Samples were then dried in the chamber of the electron microscope and imaged using a Philips XL 30 environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR).Antibiotic resistance assay. Antibiotic resistance assays were performed using identical cultures of S. aureus N315 in four RWVs, two of which were operated in the LSMMG orientation and two in the control orientation (Fig. 1B). After 20 h of culture, one vessel from the LSMMG and one from the control orientation were used to determine the initial cell concentrations, defined as 100% survival, using direct plating as described above. The two remaining vessels were carefully removed from their rotation base units to retain the aggregate structure, and 2.5 ml of the medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of ciprofloxacin to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml, corresponding to 50 times the MIC. To ensure that fluid shear force was no longer a variable, the vessels were allowed to sit statically at room temperature for 24 h, at which point the cell concentration was determined by serial dilution and plating as described above. Antibiotic resistance levels were determined using three independent biological samples.Carotenoid extraction. Quantitative comparisons of carotenoid levels between LSMMG and control cultures of S. aureus N315 were achieved spectrophotometrically as previously described by Marshall et al. (42). Briefly, based on growth curve estimates at 20 h, approximately 3.0 × 107 cells were removed from both LSMMG and control cultures. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of methanol, followed by a 5-min incubation in a 55°C water bath. The cells were then pelleted again and the supernatants recovered. Staphylococcus aureus 8325, which has a naturally occurring mutation in a positive regulator of sigma factor B, resulting in an unpigmented phenotype (33), was extracted as described above and used to establish a baseline absorbance. The absorbance of the resulting supernatant, containing the extracted carotenoid pigments, was recorded at 460 nm. The carotenoid extraction protocol was followed for samples from three separate cultures.Oxidative stress assay. The susceptibility to oxidative stress was determined for both S. aureus N315 and 8325. After 20 h of culture, the contents of the reactors were removed, placed into sterile containers, and vigorously vortexed for 30 s to disband biofilms. A concentrated stock solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was immediately added to approximately 30 ml of both LSMMG and control cultures, as cell numbers evaluated were equalized based on growth curves, bringing the overall H2O2 concentration to 30 mM. Viable microbial concentrations were determined every 15 min using serial plate counts as described above. To determine the duration of the LSMMG effect, the oxidative stress assay was repeated. S. aureus N315 was cultured for 20 h, at which point the RWV bioreactors were stopped and the contents removed and immediately placed into sterile containers, where they were allowed to sit statically. At various kinetic time points the oxidative stress assay was performed on these samples. All oxidative stress assays were performed in triplicate.Whole-blood killing assay. All relevant blood assays were reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the NASA Johnson Space Center prior to implementation. After 20 h of culture, S. aureus N315 cells from the LSMMG or control RWV were placed in sterile containers and vigorously vortexed for 30 s to disband biofilms. Cell concentrations were adjusted to approximately 1 × 104 cells in 100 μl of PBS. Blood was collected from healthy human subjects in heparinized tubes to coincide with the 20-h culture time point. A 900-μl volume of blood was immediately added to the PBS bacterial solution. The infected blood was placed in a 37°C incubator with agitation for 4 h. Samples were removed at predetermined time points, and the viable microbial concentration was determined by serial dilution as described above. The whole-blood killing assay was performed with three technical replicates and repeated in duplicate with blood from two separate subjects.RNA isolation. Samples of LSMMG and control cultured S. aureus N315 were immediately incubated with a 2:1 volume of RNAprotect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at room temperature for 10 min with occasional mixing to allow for RNA stabilization. Samples were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min, resulting in pellets that were stored at −70°C until RNA isolation was performed. The pellets were resuspended in 350 μl of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) containing 3.5 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was added to approximately 250 μl of ice-cold zirconia beads (Ambion, Austin, TX) in screw-cap tubes. Cells were lysed by bead beating at maximum speed for 5 min using the Mini-Beadbeater 8 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The lysed cell suspension was added to QIAshredder columns (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. To the homogenized lysate, 250 μl of 200 proof ethanol was added; this mixture was applied to an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen), and the standard protocol for the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with Turbo DNA-free (Ambion). Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was used to assess the quality of RNA by visualization of intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands. RNA quantity was measured with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Purified RNA was stored at −70°C until use in downstream applications.Microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling was achieved using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) GeneChip S. aureus genome array containing probe sets for over 3,300 open reading frames based on sequence information from four S. aureus strains, including N315. Total RNA was isolated as described above. The quality of the RNA was evaluated with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip processing was performed as previously described by Dunman et al. (18). Briefly, 25 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was labeled and fragmented to produce oligonucleotide probes in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix) for antisense prokaryotic arrays. The probes were then hybridized to S. aureus-specific GeneChips using the GeneChip hybridization oven 640 (Affymetrix). The chips were then washed and stained using the GeneChip fluidics station 400 (Affymetrix). The chips were scanned and data analyzed using an GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). To accurately compare expression patterns, each GeneChip was hybridized with LSMMG and control-cultured cDNA from the same date of culture. Each experiment was performed in duplicate from independent biological samples. Analysis of the data by GCOS (Affymetrix) and analysis of variance, filtered with a 2-fold cutoff limit and P value of <0.05, was used to generate a list of genes that demonstrated differential expression profiles in response to LSMMG culture.Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) and cDNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers to these genes (Table 1) were designed and purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) using their OligoPerfect designer. Standard curves were generated for each primer pair using the QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) to verify primer efficiencies as well as the absence of dimers and nonspecific products; this PCR product was also assessed for the correct amplicon size via agarose gel electrophoresis. The QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) were again used to establish expression levels. Relative expression values were determined by using the ΔΔCT method via SDS 2.2.2 software by means of relative quantification using 16S rRNA as the endogenous reference gene (Applied Biosystems). All quantitative PCR evaluations were repeated in triplicate from three independent experiments. Table 1.

The microarray data were submitted to the GenBank Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and can be found under accession number GSE28077.RESULTS A low-fluid-shear culture environment promotes S. aureus attachment-independent biofilm formation. Visual examination of the LSMMG and control cultures of N315 indicated much greater levels of clumping in the LSMMG cultures. ESEM imaging revealed the presence of a distinct extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) completely encasing the bacterial cells that was less visible on samples from the control vessel (Fig. 2). The vast amount of EPS coating encasing the aggregates of low-fluid-shear-cultured staphylococcal cells is characteristic of an S. aureus biofilm. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Environmental scanning electron microscopy images of control and LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315. Control-cultured S. aureus at 2,500× (A) and 10,000× (C) magnification revealed individual cells that were clearly visible. For low-fluid-shear-cultured S. aureus, at 2,500× (B) and 10,000× (D), the cells were much less visible and completely embedded in an EPS matrix.Low-fluid-shear-cultured S. aureus aggregates are more resistant to antibiotic stress. To further investigate the biofilm phenotype, S. aureus aggregates that formed during low-fluid-shear culture were evaluated for changes in ciprofloxacin resistance compared to control cultures. Ciprofloxacin was added directly to statically resting control and LSMMG cultures following 20 h of culture in the RWV in order to not disrupt low-fluid-shear-induced aggregates. After 24 h of exposure to ciprofloxacin, the S. aureus aggregates were 1.72-fold more resistant than bacteria cultured in the control orientation to the antibiotic (Fig. 3). The increased resistance of the aggregates is in agreement with the characteristics of attached bacterial biofilms (65). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Levels of antibiotic resistance for control and low-fluid-shear-cultured S. aureus N315. Low-shear-induced S. aureus aggregates were 1.72-fold more resistant to ciprofloxacin than bacteria cultured in the control-oriented RWV (*, P < 0.05).Low-fluid-shear culture conditions result in decreased growth for S. aureus. Biofilm conditions impact metabolism and growth (65), and previous studies of Gram-negative organisms indicated alterations in generation time and overall growth profiles (49); therefore, we examined the growth profile of S. aureus N315. As previous studies had reported that S. aureus does not exhibit altered growth profiles in the RWV bioreactor (62), the growth profile of an additional strain, S. aureus 8325, was evaluated as a control to determine if any observed changes suggested a strain-specific effect. To ensure a homogeneous distribution during measurements of cell counts, the entire contents of the vessels were removed and vigorously vortexed for all time points greater than 10 h. For both S. aureus strains, N315 and 8325, the LSMMG cultured bacteria did not reach the same concentrations as the control cultures. After 20 h of growth, cell concentrations of control cultures of S. aureus N315 were 2.9-fold higher than cultures grown in the LSMMG orientation (1.86 × 107 ± 2.6 × 106 CFU/ml versus 6.27 × 106 ± 1.32 × 106 CFU/ml [means ± standard deviations]) (Fig. 4). In a similar fashion, after 20 h of growth, CFU in control cultures of S. aureus 8325 were also significantly higher than in cultures grown in the LSMMG orientation, 5.6 × 107 ± 7.12 × 106 CFU/ml versus 1.0 × 107 ± 2.00 × 105 CFU/ml, respectively, indicating a 5.6-fold difference (data not shown). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparative growth curves of S. aureus N315 when cultured in either the LSMMG or control orientation. Culture in the LSMMG environment resulted in a 2.9-fold decrease in cell concentrations compared to control cultures.Low-fluid-shear culture reduces carotenoid production in S. aureus N315. To investigate the characteristics of the individual S. aureus cells within these biofilms, LSMMG-cultured S. aureus cells were further characterized after biofilm dispersal. S. aureus N315 develops its characteristic golden yellow color due to the primary carotenoid pigment staphyloxanthin during the stationary phase of growth. It was visibly apparent that the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315 was less pigmented than respective control cultures. To quantify this effect on carotenoid production, carotenoid levels were measured after 20 h of growth in LSMMG and control orientations. Visual color differences between cultures grown in LSMMG and control orientations (Fig. 5A) were confirmed by methanol extraction and measurement of absorbance at 460 nm as previously described by Marshall et al. (42). Absorbance of the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus was significantly lower than that of control cultures (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5B), although not as low as unpigmented S. aureus 8325, suggesting LSMMG-cultured S. aureus may produce an early intermediate of staphyloxanthin. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Decreased carotenoid production of S. aureus N315 in response to LSMMG culture. (A) Centrifugation of the control and LSMMG cultures resulted in a visual difference in the pigmentation of the pellets. (B) To quantitate the differences in carotenoid production, the carotenoids were extracted and measured spectrometrically at 460 nm. There was a significant reduction in absorbance of the LSMMG-cultured bacteria compared to the control (*, P < 0.0001). S. aureus 8325, which does not produce carotenoids, was used as a negative control for comparison.A low-fluid-shear environment enhances S. aureus N315 susceptibility to oxidative stress and is a transient effect. As carotenoids are known to have protective antioxidant properties (35), cultures of S. aureus N315 were evaluated for oxidative stress survival. As S. aureus 8325 does not produce carotenoids, the low-fluid-shear condition does not alter its pigmentation and was therefore also evaluated for susceptibility to oxidative stress. After the entire contents of the vessels were removed and vigorously vortexed, they were exposed to 30 mM hydrogen peroxide for 60 min. S. aureus N315 cultured in the LSMMG position demonstrated over 4-fold greater sensitivity to the peroxide than cultures in the control orientation (Fig. 6). As expected, the unpigmented S. aureus 8325 cultures did not display any differences between LSMMG and control orientations (data not shown), suggesting that the increased susceptibility to oxidation may be associated with the decreased production of carotenoids. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315 is more susceptible to killing by oxidative stress. After 60 min (time zero), 50% of the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus had succumbed to the damage by H2O2, whereas the control cultures did not fall below 90% (*, P < 0.05). To test the duration of the LSMMG effect, samples of both the LSMMG and control bacteria were allowed to sit statically, out of the vessels, for a period of time (1, 1.5, and 2 h) and then subjected to H2O2. At 1.5 h there failed to be a significant (*, P < 0.05) difference in the survival rates of the LSMMG- and control-cultured bacteria after 60 min, and it was determined that the LSMMG effect had diminished.To determine the duration of the LSMMG effect of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, LSMMG and control cultures were removed from the RWVs after 20 h, vortexed, and placed into sterile containers, where they remained static. Every 30 min, samples from the S. aureus N315 cultures were subjected to the oxidative stress assay described above. When the difference in survival failed to show statistical significance, we determined that the LSMMG effect had dissipated (Fig. 6). Based upon our observations from this assay, the LSMMG effect on S. aureus is transient, lasting less than 1.5 h once removed from the low-fluid-shear environment.Low-fluid-shear culture conditions enhance the susceptibility of S. aureus N315 to human whole blood. As increased oxidative stress susceptibility could indicate a decreased survival of bacteria versus innate immune cells, we investigated the survival of LSMMG-cultured S. aureus against immune components present in whole blood. To accomplish this, human subjects were scheduled for blood draws at precisely 20 h postinoculation of the RWVs with S. aureus. The whole blood was immediately returned to the lab for challenge with either the LSMMG- or control-cultured bacteria. After incubation in whole blood for 4 h, S. aureus cultured in the LSMMG orientation was significantly more susceptible to killing than controls (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the difference in percent survival between control and low-shear cultures in our two samples from different subjects was approximately 30%, revealing a consistent trend in the susceptibility of low-shear-cultured S. aureus (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of survival ability of LSMMG- and control-cultured S. aureus N315 when challenged with the immune components present in human whole blood. After 4 h, the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus displayed a significantly reduced ability to survive in whole blood compared to control cultures (*, P < 0.05).Differential gene expression in S. aureus N315 imparted by low-fluid-shear conditions. As S. aureus has demonstrated significant phenotypic differences in response to a low-shear environment, we evaluated the gene expression patterns of LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315 compared to control cultures. N315 has been fully sequenced, facilitating identification of molecular mechanisms and conserved responses to the LSMMG environment. Using S. aureus whole-genome GeneChips, we were able to identify 17 genes whose expression was upregulated in the LSMMG environment; decreased expression values could not be correlated to any gene or open reading frame (ORF). Table 2 lists the upregulated genes as well as their associated protein products, functions, ORF identification numbers from the sequencing of N315 (34), and consensus sequences in their predicted regulatory regions. The majority of these genes are involved in metabolic processes, specifically, carbohydrate, pyruvate, and arginine metabolism, or responding to environmental stressors. Genes that displayed increased expression in response to the LSMMG environment were dispersed throughout the staphylococcal chromosome, with three instances where the genes belonged to the same operon. Alignment of the LSMMG-responsive genes revealed the conserved motif t/aTGTGAt/a6TCACAt/a (with the most common nucleotides in lowercase and portions of the sequence representing regulatory binding sites underlined) in the regulatory regions of pflA and pflB, encoding formate acetyltransferase and formate acetyltransferase activating enzyme (SA0218 and SA0219); adh1, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (SA0562); ddh, encoding d-lactate dehydrogenase (SA2312); and a hypothetical protein (SA2268). This consensus sequence is a binding site for the Rex repressor (51). Additionally, the sigma factor B (SigB) promoter consensus sequence, GTTTa/ta/ t12-15GGGa/tAa/t (22), was located in regulatory regions of the operon containing alkaline shock protein 23 (SA1984 to SA1986), and ORFs of an ATP-dependent protease, clpL (SA2336); myosin-cross-reactive streptococcal antigen homologue (SA0102); a probable TdcF protein (SA0455); and hypothetical protein (SA0752).

The alternative sigma factor, SigB, is a regulator of the general stress response of S. aureus (33), and the Rex repressor protein regulates the transcription of genes involved in maintaining the intracellular NADH/NAD+ redox balance (51). Furthermore, the major cold shock protein, CspA, is a molecular chaperone and is also involved in the regulation of staphyloxanthin production (29), and the translational regulator Hfq is highly involved in the stress responses of many Gram-negative organisms and has been directly connected to the regulation of the LSMMG response in S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa (14, 72). Despite the presence of multiple conserved SigB and Rex binding sites in the regulatory regions of LSMMG-induced genes, we were unable to detect any significant differences in their expression under LSMMG conditions. Additionally, we were unable to detect any differences in the expression of cspA in response to the LSMMG culture environment. However, the expression of hfq was downregulated 2.68-fold in response to low-fluid-shear conditions.DISCUSSION Within the large intestine exists a vast range of microenvironments attributable to luminal flow rates, variations in the mucus layer, interactions with epithelial surfaces, and continually changing levels of nutrients, which microorganisms must be able to withstand (40). Material flowing through the intestinal lumen is the source of high levels of shear that bacterial cells must first endure prior to colonization (66). Once out of the direct flow in the lumen, successful colonizers assemble near the intestinal walls, where they encounter intestinal epithelial cells and decreased levels of fluid shear (24). It is at this point that the microorganism can persist and colonize or could penetrate the mucus layer and actively invade the intestinal epithelium. The persisting bacteria that find benefit in colonization of a host also find benefit in forming biofilms (67). The ability to form a biofilm imparts evolutionary advantages to bacteria, such as persistence in a favorable environment, protection from environmental stressors, antibiotics, and host immunity, communal metabolism, and an increased probability of transduction and transformation (27, 65). Microbial biofilms associated with the mucus that lines the human gastrointestinal tract have been proposed and confirmed by multiple investigators (11, 39, 52) and are gaining further interest for their role in human digestion and disease. As S. aureus is associated with intestinal colonization (1, 8, 16, 28, 61), adheres to intestinal mucus (70), and is an efficient biofilm former, there is great potential that it exhibits a biofilm phenotype while colonizing this site. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated the importance of the cecal mucus layer, within the intestinal tract of the mouse, in providing a key niche facilitating intestinal colonization by S. aureus (23). Furthermore, the intestinal tract is considered a key location where S. aureus acquires antibiotic resistance genes (59, 64), and intestinal colonization further increases the spread and carriage of S. aureus via a fecal-environmental route (8, 12), potentially allowing further genetic diversity. S. aureus has long been considered a member of the intestinal flora (15, 61) but has received little investigative attention as to its potential role as an infectious agent of gastroenteritis, as opposed to its known role as a cause of toxigenic gastroenteristis, wherein ingestion of preformed staphylococcal enterotoxins in contaminated food, and not the presence of the organism in the gut, is known to cause disease (17). Moreover, the difficulties encountered with analyzing gastrointestine-dwelling microbial communities in situ in healthy individuals, along with the instability of these biofilm structures (11), have resulted in little research concerning the formation of S. aureus biofilms in the intestine and their potential role in normal tissue function or transition to disease. Despite this, there is much to be gained from studying the structure and function of S. aureus biofilms in the gastrointestinal tract, including expanding our understanding of the mechanisms regulating virulence, as well as potentially targeting critical components necessary for biofilm formation, as has been previously proposed for staphylococcal vaccine development (25). The low levels of fluid shear created by the RWV are physiologically relevant to the brush border of the intestines (49) and trigger S. aureus attachment-independent biofilms, demonstrated by copious amounts of EPS completely encasing LSMMG-cultured bacterial cells and a corresponding increase in antibiotic resistance. Alterations of bacterial biofilm characteristics in response to the low fluid shear in the LSMMG environment have been previously demonstrated. Culture in the RWV resulted in self-aggregation and increased alginate production of P. aeruginosa and conferred a phenotype consistent with reported cystic fibrosis pathology in the lung (13). Additionally, Escherichia coli attached to glass microcarrier beads generated thicker and more resistant biofilms when cultivated under LSMMG conditions (38). Taken together, a low-fluid-shear environment stimulates increased EPS production by multiple microorganisms. If the enhanced mucoidy produced by S. aureus N315 at low fluid shear levels reflects a response comparable to the response during colonization of low fluid shear niches in the intestinal tract, then the RWV system may provide a model of intestinal, mucus-associated biofilms. Matrix-enclosed bacterial cells in an attached biofilm experience different environmental conditions than if growing planktonically (60). The environment within an extracellular matrix has been characterized as having low oxygen tension and limited nutrient availability, resulting in altered microbial metabolism (45). Using microarray analysis, we were able to identify increased expression profiles correlating to 17 ORFs. Biochemically, the protein products of many of these genes can be connected to a fermentative metabolism, as formate acetyltransferase, d-lactate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were upregulated in response to low-fluid-shear culture. The alignment of the predicted regulatory regions of LSMMG-responsive genes revealed two conserved consensus sequences: t/aTGTGA t/a6TCACAt/a and GTTTa/ta/t12-15GGGa/tAa/t. The first sequence is a binding site for the redox-sensing transcriptional repressor Rex (51). The Rex repressor is a sensor of the intracellular NADH/NAD+ redox balance, and it is considered a key regulator of anaerobic metabolism in S. aureus. The binding of Rex to NADH leads to the derepression of genes whose protein products are involved in fermentative respiration, which regenerates the NAD+ pool (51). The increased expression of genes under the control of Rex is consistent with the conditions associated within a biofilm. The second consensus sequence is a binding site for the alternate sigma factor SigB (22). SigB is a global regulator involved in the differential regulation of over 200 staphylococcal genes upon entrance into stationary phase and in response to various environmental stressors (9). Therefore, it is not surprising that genes under its control were upregulated. The role of SigB in biofilm formation, however, remains under debate (57, 69). Furthermore, 8 of the 17 LSMMG-responsive ORFs have been reported to be upregulated in biofilm cultures of S. aureus compared to planktonic culture (60). Taken together, the data from the microarray analysis support the phenotypic data that the LSMMG cultures respond to the low-shear environment by initiating a biofilm phenotype. Interestingly, our microarray results indicated upregulation of the gene encoding the ATP-dependent protease ClpL. This is notable, as Rosado et al. documented the increase of this gene in response to LSMMG culture as well (62). Furthermore, Clp proteases have been implicated in the LSMMG response of Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa (2, 14, 37, 71). The functional role of ClpL in S. aureus is unknown, as is the role of this family of proteases in response to the LSMMG environment, but it warrants further investigation. For their role as potential regulators of the LSMMG response, the expression levels of rex, sigB, cspA, and hfq were investigated. As previously described, Rex and Sig B are both transcriptional regulators whose consensus binding sites were noted in the regulatory region of multiple LSMMG-induced ORFs. CspA, the major cold shock protein in S. aureus, also functions as an RNA chaperone and has been implicated in pigment production (29). The RNA chaperone Hfq has been directly associated with the mechanism governing the LSMMG response in both S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa (14, 72). Despite the increase in expression of genes under the control of Rex and SigB, no significant difference in their expression levels in response to LSMMG was found. This was true for CspA as well. However, a 2.68-fold decrease in the expression of Hfq was observed. The role of Hfq in S. aureus is currently the subject of much debate (10, 36); however, Liu et al., through the construction of an hfq mutant, showed that Hfq can function as a global regulator in S. aureus (36). Comparing our results with the work by Liu et al. revealed that 7 of our 17 LSMMG-upregulated genes were also upregulated in response to an hfq mutation (Table 2) (36). Furthermore, 9 of our 17 LSMMG-upregulated genes were reported by Liu et al. to bind Hfq (36). Interestingly, the work by Liu et al. indicated that mutation of hfq affected pigment production and resulted in an overall decrease in virulence, which strongly correlates with our work, further suggesting that Hfq is involved in the low-shear response of S. aureus. As the RNA isolation technique was not optimal for the recovery of small RNAs and as the arrays used did not contain probes to the coding sequences of such genes, it is possible that Hfq, along with other RNA chaperones and/or small noncoding RNAs, govern the LSSMG response via classical regulators, such as Rex and SigB. More importantly, this is the first report identifying an Hfq response to low-fluid-shear conditions in a Gram-positive microorganism. This association in S. aureus, in addition to previously reported responses of Gram-negative organisms, strongly suggests that the ability to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli is evolutionarily conserved among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Growth of S. aureus N315 under low-fluid-shear conditions resulted in decreased levels of the pigmented carotenoid staphyloxanthin, a nonessential, secondary metabolite (56). Staphyloxanthin is produced through the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, which requires acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (6). The observed phenotype of a decrease in staphyloxanthin production supports our microarray data, which suggest a fermentative metabolism where pyruvate is shunted to support fermentative respiration and less acetyl-CoA enters the mevalonate pathway. It also follows that any available acetyl-CoA would be preferentially utilized for the synthesis of vital isoprenoids. For the microorganisms thus far examined, the effect of the LSMMG environment on growth kinetics is varied, including reports of the low-shear condition having no effect or resulting in higher concentrations of bacteria than in controls (3, 5, 49, 62, 73). When cultured under LSMMG conditions in a nutrient-rich broth, S. Typhimurium χ3339 displayed nearly identical growth profiles to those of the control through the mid-log growth phase (49). However, when cultured in a minimal salts medium, a marked increase in concentrations of the LSMMG-cultured bacteria compared to the control was noted (73). E. coli ATCC 26 has demonstrated an opposite effect, growing to higher concentrations in a nutrient-rich medium under LSMMG conditions yet revealing no difference in growth profiles when cultured in a minimal medium (5). As staphylococci have complex nutritional requirements, Rosado et al. used a nutrient-rich growth medium and reported no significant difference in growth between LSMMG and control cultures of three methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clinical isolates, RF1, RF6, and RF11 (62). However, when using a nutrient-rich medium in our studies, we noted an approximately 3-fold difference in the cell concentrations of MRSA strain N315 and a difference of more than 5-fold for the MSSA strain 8325. Additionally, in response to LSMMG culturing in minimal medium, E. coli ZK650 exhibited increased growth (19), whereas under the same conditions, E. coli strains AIEC 083:H1 and K-12 AMS6 displayed growth profiles similar to those of controls (3, 71). Taken together, it is most likely that changes in growth kinetics in response to LSMMG culture conditions occur on a strain-specific basis. Moreover, this study is the first to report a decrease in total cell concentration over time in response to culturing in the LSMMG environment. While the cause of this decreased growth is unclear, it may result from the heavy mucoidy and biofilm characteristics previously described. Although similarities exist between the low-fluid-shear responses of S. aureus and previously documented Gram-negative organisms, there appears to be a basic fundamental difference in virulence properties. Whereas S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and pathogenic E. coli have all shown increased virulence and/or virulence characteristics when cultured in LSMMG (3, 14, 48), S. aureus appears to favor a phenotype consistent with colonization rather than initiation of infection. This difference is exemplified by the decrease in carotenoid production in S. aureus N315. Staphyloxanthin functions as a protective coat that shields the bacterium from the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species associated with the human immune system (35). In our studies, the low-fluid-shear-cultured, unpigmented bacteria were significantly more susceptible to killing by both oxidative stress and the immune components present in human whole blood than respective pigmented control cultures. S. Typhimurium and invasive pathogenic E. coli, both enteric pathogens, are among the most significant causes of bacterial gastroenteritis (43), due, in part, to their ability to traverse the mucus layer and consequently interact with the underlying intestinal epithelium. Additionally, both have the potential to actively invade intestinal epithelial cells, affording themselves a protective environment in which to replicate (20, 21). As S. aureus does not benefit from invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, it follows that S. aureus may well colonize the low-fluid-shear environment in the mucosa near the surface of epithelial cells, establishing a biofilm phenotype. While some of the responses of S. aureus parallel those from the most thoroughly documented Gram-negative organisms to low fluid shear, such as the involvement of Hfq, the microbial response appears to differ based upon the benefit toward each individual microorganism's ability to proliferate. Contrary to previous reports of the response of enhanced virulence characteristics in several Gram-negative organisms, S. aureus initiates a biofilm/colonization phenotype that alters its metabolism, slows its growth, and downregulates virulence characteristics. This response could potentially benefit S. aureus within the gastrointestinal tract and possibly other mucosal host sites, where it would experience low levels of fluid shear. Further analysis of this low-shear response in S. aureus holds the potential to provide critical insight into key environmental factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by NASA Human Research Program student grant NNX07AM16G.

Notably, the virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is increased by low fluid shear growth conditions as measured using murine infection assays and tissue culture models (39, 52–54). Low fluid shear force (defined here as approximately <0.01 to 0.2 dynes/cm2) is characterized by a low-turbulence, low-agitation environment, as opposed to high fluid shear (defined here as approximately from 5 to >50 dynes/cm2) where liquid moves with higher velocity over the cellular surface (3–5, 21, 23, 25, 36). Low fluid shear growth environments include spaceflight, ground-based suspension culture models such as the rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, and the spaces between cellular microvilli, the last of which is encountered by numerous pathogens during the natural course of infection (21, 23, 25, 30, 40, 41). Previous work has shown that bacteria grown in low fluid shear environments induce a molecular response which includes genome-wide changes in gene expression (the low fluid shear stimulon) (6, 7, 39, 48, 52, 53, 55). Since growth under low fluid shear conditions is able to induce cellular phenotypes which are difficult or impossible to obtain via conventional culture methods, there is much potential for important previously uncharacterized genes and regulatory schemes to be revealed via the study of the low fluid shear response. The first studies to identify the bacterial genes of the low fluid shear stimulon were performed with S. Typhimurium cultures grown in an RWV bioreactor (39, 55) and during spaceflight (52, 53). Genes of the S. Typhimurium low fluid shear stimulon were found to be distributed across the genome and belong to a wide variety of functional groups, including various transport systems, lipopolysaccharide synthesis pathways, protein secretion mechanisms, various metabolic pathways, and genes of unknown function (52, 53, 55). In addition, several genes encoding previously uncharacterized transcriptional regulatory proteins in S. Typhimurium were also found to be part of the low fluid shear stimulon (52, 53, 55). These genes are of particular interest not only for their potential role in mediating bacterial responses to low fluid shear but also for their potential to allow us to better understand the global circuits that influence bacterial physiology in general. It is highly likely that previously unexplored transcriptional regulators that are identified via the low fluid shear stimulon will be involved in aspects of prokaryotic biology that are able to be studied under “standard conditions” outside the context of low fluid shear. The S. Typhimurium gene ydcI (also known as STM1625 in the S. Typhimurium genome) belongs to the aforementioned class of potential transcriptional regulators that are members of the low fluid shear stimulon as determined using microarray analysis with total cell RNA with a 2-fold change cutoff (54, 55). However, the ydcI gene is completely uncharacterized and has not been previously studied beyond being identified via genome sequence analysis. This study aimed to characterize the ydcI gene (and the YdcI protein) to answer basic questions regarding its role in S. Typhimurium biology and the function of its protein product. Our results indicate that the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene (i) is conserved across genera, (ii) autoregulates its expression, (iii) encodes a DNA binding protein that binds with specificity, (iv) is required for full resistance of S. Typhimurium to acid stress, (v) appears to be a member of the rpoS regulon, and (vi) when induced, alters S. Typhimurium interactions with host cells and facilitates biofilm formation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized gene identified via study of the low fluid shear stimulon is involved in responses that can be observed outside the low fluid shear environment. This report provides a foundation for further analysis of the ydcI gene and other previously uncharacterized transcriptional regulators of the low fluid shear stimulon. The study of these genes may allow us to engineer bacteria for beneficial purposes by disrupting or inducing certain signals in a controlled manner resulting in improved vaccines and other applications (10, 11, 32).MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media. Please refer to Table 1 for a list of strains and plasmids used in this study. S. Typhimurium strain χ3339 was used as the wild type (WT), and all mutations were analyzed in this background (22). Construction of the S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutation was performed using lambda Red recombination as previously described (12, 45) and by using the DNA primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. A Cmr cassette from pKD3 (12) was inserted at nucleotide 166 of the S. Typhimurium ydcI open reading frame (ORF) in the same orientation as the ydcI ORF. To obtain the ΔydcI::lacZ fusion, the Cmr cassette at the site of the ΔydcI mutation was deleted using Flp recombinase expressed from pCP20 (12), and then the lacZ plasmid pCE36 (13) was inserted at the single FRT site at this location as previously described (13). To construct the WT ydcI::lacZ fusion, we performed an identical procedure by inserting the Cmr cassette immediately after the stop codon of ydcI and inserting pCE36 at this location. The strain containing Cm::lacZ was obtained by inserting the Cmr-encoding gene from pKD3 immediately upstream of the lacZ gene in the ΔydcI::lacZ mutant strain using Red recombination such that the Cmr-encoding gene promoter replaces the ydcI promoter and drives lacZ expression. All constructions were verified using PCR analysis. The ΔrpoS mutation (which is marked by Apr) was transferred via P22 transduction from donor strain χ4973 (38). To restore WT rpoS in the WT ydcI::lacZ ΔrpoS strain, a strain containing a Cmr marker at gene STM2901 (located approximately 20 kb from the rpoS gene) was used as a donor for P22 transduction, and Cmr recipients were screened for ampicillin sensitivity (50). A Cmr Apr isolate from this transduction was used as a control. Plasmid pBAD18+ydcI was constructed using a synthesized ydcI gene in which a six-histidine tag was fused to the C terminus and cloned into pUC57 (56) and then subcloned into pBAD18 (24) downstream of the arabinose-inducible promoter (Genscript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The entire length of the construct was verified via sequencing. Strains were grown using LB (Lennox) medium supplemented with the following antibiotics when necessary: ampicillin, 200 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. Table 1.

The YdcI homologs from the indicated Gram-negative species were identified using BLAST search analysis with S. Typhimurium YdcI (GenBank accession no. AAL20543) as the query (1). Homologs were aligned using CLUSTAL W analysis as previously described (46, 51).Gene expression analysis. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed as described previously (51, 55), using approximately 4 to 6 μg RNA from late-log-phase cultures (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] = 0.9 to 1.4). RNA was isolated using RNA Protect reagent and RNeasy spin prep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). LacZ assays were performed with late-log-phase cultures using standard protocols as described previously (35), and the data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of three or four independent experiments each assayed in duplicate or triplicate reactions.Expression and purification of YdcI protein. Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing pBAD18+ydcI was grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.5 to 0.8, induced with 0.1% arabinose, and then grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested, lysed using B-Per reagent (Pierce/Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL), and processed for isolation of YdcI protein (with a six-histidine tag) using nickel-agarose spin columns in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis with anti-six-histidine antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, Inc., Newberg, OR) were performed using standard protocols as described previously (2, 49, 50).Gel shift assays. Gel shift reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 μg salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin with approximately 1 ng of probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being loaded onto a prerun 8% acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 150 V. Probe labeling and detection were performed using a nonradioactive kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce/Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL) with positively charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The 180-bp probe H3 consisted of DNA extending upstream from 38 bp downstream of the ydcI ATG codon (S. Typhimurium coordinates 1714755 to 1714935) that was PCR amplified using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material and purified using a spin column in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The 182-bp probe H5 consisted of DNA upstream of the H3 probe from coordinates 1714573 to 1714754, and the lacZ probe consisted of 152 bp amplified from the lacZ gene using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Competition assays were performed under the binding conditions described above with increasing amounts of a molar excess of unlabeled DNA that was either specific (the 180-bp ydcI promoter fragment) or nonspecific (lacZ fragment), as indicated.Thermal, osmotic, and acid stress assays. Stress assays were performed as described previously, using shaking broth cultures grown to stationary phase (39, 52–54). The data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of four independent experiments each plated in triplicate.Tissue culture invasion and intracellular survival assays. Invasion of Int407 intestinal epithelial cells and survival in J774 macrophages were assayed as described previously with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 30 using late-log-phase broth shaking cultures (49–52, 54). The data (see Fig. 7) are from four to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate tissue culture wells, except for the pBAD18+lacZ strains, which are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Invasion of Int407 cells and survival in J774 macrophages. (A) The indicated S. Typhimurium strains were tested for invasion of Int407 cells via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of percent invasion of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. The ΔSPI-1 strain contains a deletion of the SPI-1 genes required for full invasion of Int407 cells. The ΔSPI-1 and ΔydcI mutant strains were compared to the WT for ratio calculation. The pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, and pBAD18+lacZ strains were compared to the WT pBAD18 strain under the corresponding arabinose condition for ratio calculation. (B) The indicated strains were tested for survival in J774 macrophages over a period of 18 to 20 h via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of the percent survival of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. For ratio calculations, the ΔydcI mutant strain was compared to the WT and the pBAD18+ydcI strain was compared to the pBAD18 strain.Biofilm formation. Strain χ3339 containing pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, or pBAD18+lacZ was grown overnight in the absence of arabinose, diluted 1:50 in fresh medium, grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.6 to 0.8, supplemented with arabinose to 0.1%, and grown for an additional 12 to 16 h. Crystal violet staining of biofilms and subsequent quantitation were performed as described previously (9, 43).Low fluid shear studies. To test S. Typhimurium responses to low fluid shear culture, the RWV bioreactor was used to grow cultures of each strain in the low fluid shear and control orientations as described previously (references 52 and 53 for acid stress and reference 54 for oxidative stress). The cultures were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5 with citric acid) and oxidative stress (70 mM H2O2) and assayed for survival as described previously (references 52 and 53 for acid stress and 54 for oxidative stress). The results are from three to six independent RWV experiments each plated in triplicate.RESULTS The S. Typhimurium ydcI gene encodes a conserved protein. We used the S. Typhimurium YdcI protein sequence (GenBank accession no. AAL20543) as a query in a BLAST search for homologs in the protein database. The results of this search indicated that the YdcI protein sequence belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators and is highly conserved among Gram-negative genomes, including the genera Escherichia, Shigella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Serratia (Fig. 1). The e values for the alignments in Fig. 1 are all less than 10−140, except that for the Serratia protein, which is 10−92. We also found that the YdcI protein is encoded by Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Brucella, and Ruegeria at a somewhat lower level of homology (e values between 10−71 and 10−49) but still representing a high degree of conservation in these genera (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The genomic organization of the location of the ydcI gene in the genera from Fig. 1 is also conserved (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). These results indicate that the ydcI gene is conserved across multiple Gram-negative genera and suggest evolutionary selection for the function of this gene in prokaryotic biology. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Alignment of the S. Typhimurium YdcI protein with homologs present in a range of other Gram-negative genera. Yellow highlighting indicates amino acid identity (in at least five of the proteins). The e values for the aligned proteins are less than 10−140, except for the Serratia protein, whose e value is 10−92.Analysis of ydcI gene expression. To test if the ydcI gene is expressed in different bacterial genera, we isolated total RNA from cultures of S. Typhimurium, Salmonella Typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter koseri and performed an RT-PCR analysis using primers against the ydcI homolog in each strain. We detected ydcI homolog expression via this assay indicating that this gene is able to be transcribed across genera (Fig. 2). To further analyze ydcI gene expression, we constructed lacZ transcriptional fusions in the chromosomal copy of the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene. Two such fusions were constructed; the WT ydcI::lacZ and ΔydcI::lacZ alleles contain the promoterless lacZ gene fused immediately after the ydcI stop codon and at nucleotide 166 of the 912-bp ydcI gene, respectively (Fig. 3A). The latter construct is predicted to abolish normal YdcI protein function, thereby allowing comparison of lacZ reporter expression in the presence and absence of WT YdcI protein. We found that the WT ydcI::lacZ fusion was expressed 3-fold less than the ΔydcI::lacZ construct (Fig. 3B). We introduced a plasmid expressing the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene from an arabinose-inducible promoter (pBAD18+ydcI) into the ΔydcI::lacZ mutant strain. In the presence of arabinose, this strain expressed significantly less lacZ than the control strain containing the vector only (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results indicate that the YdcI protein negatively autoregulates its expression under the conditions tested here and is expressed at relatively low levels when this autoregulation is intact. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab RT-PCR of ydcI gene homologs in a range of Gram-negative genera. The plus and minus lanes contain samples with and without reverse transcriptase, respectively. The Ch lane contains samples where chromosomal DNA isolated from the indicated strain was used in the PCR. NCR refers to a noncoding region in the S. Typhimurium genome between two divergent promoters that is not predicted to be transcribed.Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Analysis of ydcI::lacZ fusions in S. Typhimurium. (A) A promoterless lacZ gene was transcriptionally fused to the WT and ΔydcI mutant alleles of the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene in separate strains. The maps of the WT, ΔydcI::lacZ, and WT ydcI::lacZ gene loci in the S. Typhimurium strain genomes are shown. (B) The LacZ activity of the strains in panel A is shown. In addition, the ΔydcI::lacZ strain was transformed with either pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcI and assayed for LacZ activity in the presence or absence of arabinose.Purification and DNA binding activity of YdcI protein. To test the YdcI protein for DNA binding activity, we cloned the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter on the plasmid vector pBAD18 (24). In this construct, we also fused the coding sequence for a six-histidine epitope immediately after the last codon such that the YdcI protein would be expressed with a C-terminal tag. Arabinose-dependent expression of the YdcI protein was demonstrated via Western blot analysis, and we then purified the fusion protein using nickel agarose columns (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). To test the DNA binding activity of YdcI, we incubated YdcI protein from either cell extracts or purified preparations with a 180-bp DNA probe (named H3) consisting of the sequence immediately upstream of the S. Typhimurium ydcI ORF as indicated in Materials and Methods. Both sources of YdcI protein shifted the labeled H3 probe in this assay (Fig. 4A). To test the specificity of the YdcI DNA binding activity, we used a 152-bp probe consisting of lacZ gene DNA, and YdcI did not shift this probe (Fig. 4B). In addition, we also synthesized a 182-bp probe (named H5) consisting of DNA from the ydcI promoter region that extends immediately upstream of the H3 probe and show that YdcI does not shift this probe (Fig. 4B). We also incubated gel shift reaction mixtures with an excess of unlabeled ydcI promoter fragment H3 (specific competitor) or unlabeled lacZ fragment (nonspecific competitor). The results are consistent with a specific YdcI DNA binding activity since the specific competitor abolished binding to the probe and the nonspecific competitor did not (Fig. 4C). Since YdcI is a DNA binding protein that has not been previously characterized, we used the gel shift assay to determine an apparent dissociation constant (KD) for the YdcI binding activity. The concentration of YdcI protein at which 50% binding occurred (and thus indicated the apparent KD under these conditions) was approximately 2.3 to 4.6 nM (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). This magnitude of apparent KD is consistent with documented specific DNA binding activity of members of this protein family (34, 44, 47) and is consistent with the conclusion that the ydcI gene encodes a specific DNA binding protein. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Gel shift assays with YdcI protein. (A) The labeled H3 DNA probe from the S. Typhimurium ydcI promoter region was incubated with YdcI cell extracts or purified YdcI protein and run in an 8% acrylamide–TBE gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, TOP10(pBAD18+ydcI) extract, 300 ng; 3, TOP10(pBAD18) extract, 300 ng; 4, purified YdcI protein, approximately 10 nM. (B) Gel shift reaction mixtures with different probes incubated with purified YdcI protein. Lanes: 1, H5 probe alone; 2, H5 probe plus YdcI; 3, H3 probe alone; 4, H3 probe plus YdcI; 5, lacZ probe alone; 6, lacZ probe plus YdcI. (C) YdcI gel shift reaction mixtures with labeled H3 probe were incubated with unlabeled specific (H3 DNA fragment) or nonspecific (lacZ DNA fragment) competitor DNA and then run in an 8% acrylamide gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, no competitor; 3 to 5, specific competitor at 135×, 270×, and 540× molar excesses, respectively; 6 to 8, nonspecific competitor at 135×, 270×, and 540× molar excesses, respectively.Since our results indicated that a YdcI DNA binding site is located within the H3 probe, we used the Microfootprinter program (http://bio.cs.washington.edu/MicroFootPrinter.html) to identify possible YdcI binding sites within the H3 fragment (37). This analysis yielded two candidate sites in the H3 fragment, but two separate 40-bp probes containing each site did not display binding to YdcI protein in the gel shift assay (data not shown).Stress assays reveal an acid resistance defect in an S. Typhimurium ydcI mutant. In order to study the role of the ydcI gene in Salmonella biology, we constructed a knockout mutation of the ydcI gene in the chromosome of S. Typhimurium using the lambda Red recombination system (see Materials and Methods for details). We observed no significant growth differences between the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains using OD600 and CFU measurements in a growth curve (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). Since the ydcI gene was initially brought to our attention as a member of a stimulon of genes that change expression under conditions that alter bacterial stress resistance, we tested the ydcI mutant for osmotic, thermal, oxidative, and acid stress resistance compared to that of the isogenic WT strain. Under conditions of osmotic and thermal stress, we did not observe a significant difference in survival between the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains (Fig. 5). Under conditions of oxidative stress, we observed inconsistent results that may indicate a survival defect under these conditions of the ΔydcI mutant compared to the WT, but this experiment requires further study to determine a conclusive effect (data not shown). However, under both organic (citric acid) and inorganic (HCl) acid stress (pH 3.5), we observed a significant difference between the survival of the ΔydcI mutant and that of the WT strain (Fig. 5). Both the organic and inorganic acid resistance defects can be complemented by a functional copy of ydcI provided on a plasmid (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the ydcI gene is required for full acid stress resistance of S. Typhimurium under the conditions studied here and likely expresses a protein that serves to regulate genes involved in acid stress resistance. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Acid resistance defect in S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant. Isogenic WT and ΔydcI S. Typhimurium strains were tested for resistance to osmotic (2.5 M NaCl), thermal (50°C), and acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid or HCl) stress over a time period of 120 min. The percent survival of the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains under the corresponding stress (compared to before addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of the indicated ΔydcI mutant test strain to that of the WT strain is shown. The ΔydcI mutant strain containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcI was grown in the presence of arabinose.Relationship between the ydcI and rpoS genes. The S. Typhimurium rpoS gene encodes a highly conserved sigma factor that is required for the expression of a wide array of genes involved in resistance to a range of environmental stresses and has been termed the “master regulator” of bacterial stress resistance (16, 26, 29). Since the ydcI gene is required for full acid stress resistance of S. Typhimurium, we compared the phenotype of an S. Typhimurium ΔydcI ΔrpoS double mutant to that of the ΔydcI and ΔrpoS single mutants to distinguish between the possibilities that ydcI and rpoS are part of the same pathway or part of separate, additive pathways. In the citric acid resistance assay, we observed that the ΔrpoS mutant displayed high sensitivity within 30 min, but the ΔydcI mutant did not display its sensitivity until 120 min after the addition of stress (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6A). Thus, within 30 min of citric acid stress exposure, the ΔydcI and WT strains display similar phenotypes (Fig. 6A). However, the ΔydcI ΔrpoS double mutant displayed a citric acid resistance defect that was identical to that of the ΔrpoS single mutant (Fig. 6A). In the HCl acid resistance assay, both the ΔydcI and ΔrpoS single mutants display high sensitivity within 30 min of acid exposure, but the ΔrpoS mutant is significantly more sensitive than the ΔydcI mutant during this time (Fig. 6A). The ΔydcI ΔrpoS double mutant displayed an HCl acid resistance defect identical to that of the ΔrpoS single mutant. These results suggest that the ydcI and rpoS genes act via the same pathway and do not act in an additive manner in separate pathways to provide WT levels of acid resistance. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Relationship between ydcI and rpoS genes. (A) The indicated strains were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5) with citric acid or HCl as indicated over a 30-min time period. The percent survival of the strains (compared to before the addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of the test strain to the WT strain is shown. Note that the phenotype of the ΔydcI mutant is similar to the WT for citric acid stress within 30 min (the data in Fig. 5 are from 120 min of acid stress). The P values were calculated as comparisons of the indicated strains and the ΔydcI single mutant strain. (B) Cultures of the indicated strains were assayed for LacZ activity and plotted for Miller units. All strains are in the χ3339 background, as indicated in Table 1. Cm::lacZ indicates that the lacZ gene in this strain is transcribed via the Cmr gene promoter. STM2901::Cm indicates the gene location of a Cmr marker linked to the WT rpoS gene within approximately 20 kb of DNA in the S. Typhimurium genome.To test if rpoS plays a role in the expression of the ydcI gene, we constructed a WT ydcI::lacZ ΔrpoS strain and compared the LacZ activity of this strain to that of the WT ydcI::lacZ strain. Remarkably, the WT ydcI::lacZ ΔrpoS strain completely lost LacZ activity, in contrast to the control (Fig. 6B). A control strain in which the same lacZ reporter gene was driven by the Cmr-encoding gene promoter was not affected by the presence of the ΔrpoS mutation (Fig. 6B). To demonstrate that the loss of WT ydcI::lacZ activity was not due to a random artifact of strain construction, we restored the WT rpoS allele to the WT ydcI::lacZ ΔrpoS strain using P22 transduction of a Cmr marker linked to the WT rpoS allele as described in Materials and Methods. This strain displayed WT levels of WT ydcI::lacZ activity, in contrast to the control, confirming that the ΔrpoS mutation was responsible for the expression defect (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the double mutant studies and lacZ reporter analysis provide significant evidence that the ydcI gene is part of the rpoS regulon in S. Typhimurium.Tissue culture invasion assays. To test for a role for ydcI in S. Typhimurium invasion of cultured intestinal epithelial cells, we compared the ΔydcI mutant strain to the WT for entry into Int407 cells. The results indicated that the ΔydcI mutant did not differ significantly from the WT in Int407 invasion (Fig. 7A). However, we also tested the invasion phenotype of strains in which ydcI expression had been induced or “turned on” as an alternative to analysis of the deletion mutant (in which the gene is removed). Since expression of the ydcI gene from the pBAD18+ydcI construct restored the repression of a chromosomal ΔydcI::lacZ fusion to WT levels, expressed a protein displaying specific DNA binding activity as predicted, and complemented the ΔydcI acid resistance defect back to WT levels, we reasoned that this construct would be an appropriate reagent for this purpose. WT strain χ3339 containing pBAD18+ydcI invaded Int407 cells to a level 2.8 times higher than that of controls in the presence of arabinose (Fig. 7A). Control strains containing the pBAD18 vector alone or pBAD18+lacZ did not display increased cell entry in either the presence or the absence of arabinose (Fig. 7A). The latter strain expresses copious amounts of LacZ protein (several thousand Miller units) in the presence of arabinose (reference 42 and data not shown). This indicates that this phenotype is specific to ydcI induction and not merely due to general overexpression of protein in this strain. The pBAD18 and pBAD18+ydcI strains displayed virtually identical levels of adherence to Int407 cells under these conditions (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). The SPI-1 genes encode a type III secretion system used to facilitate invasion of nonphagocytic cells like those of the Int407 line (18–20). To test if induction of ydcI could serve to reverse the invasion defect of the ΔSPI-1 strain, we introduced the pBAD18+ydcI plasmid into this strain, induced ydcI expression via arabinose, and tested invasion of the culture. We did not observe any reversal of the ΔSPI-1 invasion defect under these conditions compared to the control strain containing the vector alone (Fig. 7A). This may suggest that the increased invasion upon ydcI induction in the WT strain background occurs via the SPI-1 pathway. We also tested if the ΔydcI mutation or induction of ydcI expression had any effect on S. Typhimurium survival in J774 macrophages. Neither the deletion nor the induction of the ydcI gene had any effect on S. Typhimurium macrophage survival (Fig. 7B).Biofilm formation. When cultures of strain χ3339 containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcI were supplemented with arabinose and allowed to grow for approximately 12 to 16 h postsupplementation, we observed that the strain containing pBAD18+ydcI formed a biofilm which was especially prominent at the medium-air interface (Fig. 8A). This biofilm was readily stained with crystal violet, indicating significant cell adhesion (Fig. 8A), and this observation was confirmed via microscopy (data not shown). Biofilm staining was readily observed in areas below the medium-air interface, suggesting that biofilm-mediated adhesion was not dependent on the interface (Fig. 8A). The control strain containing pBAD18 did not form a biofilm after arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8A). In addition, both strains did not form a biofilm under the same growth conditions in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). To confirm that biofilm formation was not the result of general protein expression from the pBAD18 arabinose-inducible promoter, we performed the same assay with strain χ3339 containing pBAD18+lacZ. This strain had a phenotype identical to that of the pBAD18 control and did not form a biofilm upon arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8B). Quantitation of crystal violet staining of the biofilm confirmed the qualitative differences observed between the strains in Fig. 8 (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Induction of ydcI expression results in S. Typhimurium biofilm formation. (A) S. Typhimurium strain χ3339 containing either pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcI was grown in the presence of arabinose for approximately 16 h in LB medium. The white arrow indicates significant biofilm accumulation at the medium-air interface. The upper and lower panels show culture appearance and crystal violet-stained flasks (with cultures removed), respectively. (B) The same as panel A, except that strain χ3339 containing pBAD18+lacZ was tested.Low fluid shear studies. To test if the ydcI gene plays a role in transmission of the low fluid shear environmental signal in S. Typhimurium, we tested both the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains for two separate phenotypes induced by low fluid shear growth in the RWV apparatus. Previous studies have established that low fluid shear conditions alter the acid and oxidative stress resistance profiles of WT S. Typhimurium (39, 41, 52–55). We grew cultures of the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains under low fluid shear and control conditions in the RWV and subjected these cultures to separate acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid) and oxidative (70 mM H2O2) stresses. In both tests, the ΔydcI mutant strain displayed the same low fluid shear-induced phenotype as the WT strain (Fig. 9). This indicates that the ydcI gene is not required for these low fluid shear responses in S. Typhimurium under these conditions. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Low fluid shear phenotypes of WT and ΔydcI mutant strains via RWV culture. The S. Typhimurium WT and ΔydcI mutant strains were grown in the RWV apparatus in low fluid shear (LFS) or control conditions, and the cultures were tested for acid stress resistance (pH 3.5 with citric acid) or oxidative stress resistance (70 mM H2O2) in separate assays. The percent survival of the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains for each culture condition in each stress was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of each sample to the control condition for each stress is shown. Low fluid shear culture alters stress resistance compared to the control for both the WT and ΔydcI mutant strains.DISCUSSION Growth conditions such as spaceflight and RWV culture that are characterized by low fluid shear force have been shown to increase bacterial virulence (39, 52, 53). In addition, an array of other phenotypes is induced or altered via this growth environment (6, 7, 40, 41). Interestingly, these fluid shear levels are relevant to those encountered by certain pathogens in the human host during the course of infection (23, 36, 40, 41). However, this environmental cue is not well characterized, and a number of uncharacterized genes with unknown function are part of a stimulon associated with low fluid shear force (7, 52, 53, 55). Unexplored genes with potentially important, observable roles in prokaryotic biology could be part of this stimulon, but they may not have been previously analyzed because they have not been identified as part of any established regulatory networks or phenotypes. One such gene, S. Typhimurium ydcI, was discovered to be a member of the S. Typhimurium low fluid shear stimulon and has been predicted be homologous to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators (54, 55). However, the ydcI gene was previously uncharacterized before this study. The goals of this study were to characterize the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene for a role in bacterial biology and to analyze the DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. In this report, we demonstrate that the ydcI gene (i) is conserved in a range of Gram-negative bacteria, (ii) is expressed in S. Typhimurium and other Gram-negative species, (iii) is autorepressed in S. Typhimurium, (iv) encodes a DNA binding protein that binds specifically to a probe from the ydcI promoter, (v) is required for full resistance of S. Typhimurium to acid stress, (vi) is part of the rpoS regulon, (vii) can increase S. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells when induced, and (viii) can cause biofilm formation in S. Typhimurium when induced. These results indicate that the ydcI gene likely serves as a DNA binding transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in aspects of bacterial biology, including stress resistance and possibly virulence. A major goal in the future study of ydcI will be to identify the genes that are members of a potential “YdcI regulon” to understand how genes regulated by YdcI are linked to stress resistance, host cell interactions, biofilm formation, and other prokaryotic functions. In addition, future studies will focus on determining if ydcI has a role in the transmission of the low fluid shear environmental cue to bacterial cells beyond the experiments performed here. Though the results of Fig. 9 show that the ydcI gene is not required for the low fluid shear phenotypes tested as part of this study, this gene may be involved in other low fluid shear responses not yet tested (including in other species beyond S. Typhimurium). Expression of the ydcI gene is upregulated by low fluid shear growth conditions (54, 55). Interestingly, though the ydcI gene is clearly expressed in bacteria under “standard” culture conditions, the S. Typhimurium ydcI gene appears to be repressed and expressed at relatively low levels under these conditions. One intriguing possibility is that ydcI is expressed at a certain level under one set of conditions and is then upregulated by an environmental signal(s) to induce adaptive cellular changes for another set of conditions. As indicated by our data, these changes could include altering resistance to stresses, interactions with host cells, or physiology related to biofilm formation. Whether these changes function to adapt S. Typhimurium or other bacteria for their roles as pathogens remains to be determined with future studies. However, our data suggest that, at a minimum, the ydcI gene likely regulates genes with the potential for involvement in functions related to stress resistance, growth/survival, and possibly virulence. The observation that ydcI expression involves the RpoS sigma factor provides support to this hypothesis since RpoS controls the expression of a regulon of genes involved in stress resistance and virulence (16, 26, 29, 38). However, we have previously reported that RpoS is not required for a range of low fluid shear responses in S. Typhimurium (54). Therefore, a possible scheme for the regulation of ydcI expression is that RpoS is used for expression under certain conditions and another (yet to be identified) pathway is used for expression under other conditions (such as low fluid shear). Future studies will be aimed at determining how ydcI gene regulation fits into regulatory schemes in a range of bacteria. This is the first report to demonstrate DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. We show that both (i) extracts containing YdcI protein and (ii) purified YdcI protein are able to bind a DNA probe (from the S. Typhimurium ydcI promoter region) in a specific manner. The YdcI DNA binding activity displays an apparent dissociation constant with a value consistent with specific DNA binding proteins with biologic functions and consistent with other members of LysR family (to which YdcI belongs) (34, 44, 47). Induced expression of the YdcI protein repressed an S. Typhimurium ydcI::lacZ fusion and complemented the acid resistance defect of an S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant. These observations suggest that the YdcI DNA binding activity functions in bacterial cells to affect physiological changes. Future studies will be aimed at determining (i) the specific DNA site that is recognized by YdcI, (ii) the genes associated with YdcI binding sites, and (iii) whether these sites are used by YdcI in other bacterial species. We identified potential binding sites within the H3 probe fragment, but smaller DNA fragments containing these individual sites did not display YdcI binding activity. Identification of the actual YdcI binding site will require additional, systematic study that is beyond the scope of this report. However, this report provides a foundation for analyzing the previously uncharacterized YdcI DNA binding activity via a number of approaches. Though induced ydcI expression affects S. Typhimurium intestinal epithelial cell invasion and biofilm formation, we do not know how the YdcI protein functions in these phenotypes. We demonstrate that the host cell interaction phenotype only affects the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and not survival in macrophages. One possibility for this may be that ydcI can alter the expression of genes involved in SPI-1 type III secretion-mediated invasion of nonphagocytic cells or other genes involved in specific interactions with epithelial cells. Indeed, the induction of ydcI did not increase invasion by a ΔSPI-1 strain, suggesting that ydcI possibly acts through the SPI-1 pathway for increased invasion. We tested a SPI-1 invI::lacZ fusion for altered expression in the presence of pBAD18+ydcI and found that ydcI induction produced a 7.1-fold decrease in reporter expression (data not shown). This indicates that YdcI may potentially alter SPI-1 gene expression as part of its function, but how YdcI would do this in the context of the many different SPI-1 genes and the other regulators of SPI-1 gene expression remains to be determined. Systematic identification of the genes regulated by YdcI and elucidation of how YdcI controls these genes as part of an overall regulatory scheme will require further controlled study. Biofilm formation in Salmonella spp. appears to be a complex process and has been shown to involve a number of different genes involved in flagella and curli fiber formation, cellulose production, and O-antigen synthesis (8, 9, 27, 28, 31). In addition, there are likely at least two different types of biofilms formed by Salmonella spp. that are utilized on either cholesterol-rich surfaces (like gallstones) or on material surfaces like glass or plastic (8, 9). We do not know how ydcI affects Salmonella genes involved in biofilm formation, but studies aimed at determining the nature of the ydcI-induced biofilm and the genes involved in this process are currently being pursued.Supplementary Material [Supplemental material] supp_193_9_2208__index.html (1.4KB, html) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We acknowledge the support of NASA grant NCC2-1362, NASA grant NNX09AH40G, and the Department of Biology and ORSP, Villanova University.

    "abstract": "Abstract Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees [1], including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution, increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation, introduced species and disease, including infectious disease [2], [3]. Although evidence of disease in amphibian populations is not new, early literature on amphibian health in natural populations is quite scattered, deals primarily with anurans and/or local problems, or was initiated because of concerns related to supply and demand and decline of commercial harvest [4]–[6]. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, various biological supply houses noted problems in the commercial supply of amphibians causing Maugh [7] to comment on “the apparent short supply and diseased state of amphibians collected in nature”. The review of mycoses of amphibians by Reichenback-Klinke and Elkan [8] primarily focuses on Basidiobolus ranarum and Saprolegnia parasitica and indicates the dearth of knowledge relating to the distribution and importance of microfungi associated with amphibians. With few exceptions, this void continued for the next two decades [9]–[12]. The impetus for research on amphibian microbes became a major focal point of the 1st World Herpetology Congress in Canterbury, England in 1989, where herpetologists shared their observations on declining frog populations and developed initial strategies to investigate the potential problems. The discovery that the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a zoosporic fungus related to infectious oomycete water molds, Saprolegnia spp., was capable of causing lethal dermatitis in amphibians led to a proliferation of studies [13]. After reviewing studies of microbes implicated in amphibian population declines, including chytridiomycosis, Ranavirus disease, saprolegniosis and Ribieroia spp., Daszak et al. [14] concluded that “available data provide the clearest link for the fungal disease amphibian chytridiomycosis”. Herpetological Review dedicated an entire section to amphibian chytridiomycosis geographical distribution [15]–[17]. The advances in research on the secretions, structure, and functions of amphibian integument and their products reveal a remarkable complexity of bioactive secretions and diversity of amines, peptides, alkaloids, bufodienolides, and other compounds [18], [19]. The presence of antimicrobial agents in amphibian skin hypothesized by Csordas and Michl [20] and Croce et al. [21] has led to an increased interest in the relationship of the bacteria and fungi present in the skin of amphibians and the antimicrobial peptides and metabolites that they produce [22]–[30]. Some of these peptides and alkaloids can inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi [31], [32] and common cutaneous bacteria from the terrestrial salamander Plethodon cinerus can inhibit pathogenic fungi [33]. Evidence also suggests that symbiotic bacteria may contribute to innate immune defense of some amphibians [30]. While evidence suggests that these antimicrobial compounds and symbiotic bacteria can provide some level of protection for amphibians against microbial invaders [30]–[33], the connection between disease and amphibian decline has been confirmed for some amphibian populations [34]. However, long-term amphibian studies, especially those including population and environmental data, are so rare that we have very few data to support many claims related to decline or changes in, or the health of, wild amphibian populations [35]. One long-term study subject, the Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganensis bishopi, and its habitat within a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River (NFWR), has been the subject of numerous investigations since the intensive 110 day surveys conducted during 1969–1971 [36], [37]. In 1969, the 4.6 km research section within the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, was a crystalline, substantially spring-fed stream located in the least densely human populated area of the second least densely populated county in the state (9 people/sq mi; [38]). Only one rarely used sportsman's cabin graced the banks of the research section in 1969. The springs and occasionally the river were used as drinking water by some locals and visitors. From 1969 to 1980, 169 days of skin-diving surveys, coupled with environmental sampling, were conducted in this section, including some in every year and within every calendar month, but not every month of every year [39]. Population and ecological studies of the aquatic Ozark Hellbender C. a. bishopi and its habitat were conducted in this section during 1969–1971 [36], [37]. Other ecological studies included year-round water quality, benthic habitat, macro-invertebrate structure, cottid fish diet studies, and numerous shorter-term studies [36], [40]. These early studies in the NFWR found an immense and healthy population of C. a. bishopi, as many as 428 individuals/km, and almost no abnormalities/injuries. Only 2.9% of 479 individuals observed in 1969 were abnormal/injured and they exhibited rapid regeneration capabilities [36], [39], [41]. Additional surveys between 1972 to 1980 continued to show immense and healthy populations of Ozark Hellbenders [27], [42]. All surveys during this time period ranged from between 9–12 individual Ozark hellbenders collected per hour per person (Nickerson et al, unpublished data). Reassessment of the ecological characteristics of the NFWR conducted in 2004–2007 revealed extensive habitat alteration and degradation, including increased land development, siltation, sedimentation, and water quality degradation [43]. Community changes included algal and nuisance aquatic vegetation blooms, otter establishment, and fish and macroinvertebrate community alterations [43]. Canoe use within the NFWR significantly increased [43]. Intensive surveys of the NFWR hellbender population conducted in 2005 yielded only 55 individuals, of which 26 (i.e., 47%) had visible abnormalities/injuries, including loss of limbs, limbs with exposed bones, and degeneration of other tissues which did not regenerate or had remarkably retarded regeneration (J. Briggler, unpublished data). The high prevalence of abnormalities/injuries and the lack of the historically characteristic (rapid) regeneration of injured/affected tissue in hellbenders in the NFWR was the impetus for our examination of the microbial community associated with the observed abnormalities/injuries.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods The Ozark Hellbender, C. a. bishopi, is now listed as endangered and populations have been extirpated and face extinction in much of the former range. The NFWR currently supports only a very small population of C. a. bishopi, of which about 50% within the original NFWR research section of Nickerson and Mays [36], [37] have substantial abnormalities/injuries (J. Briggler unpublished data). On 17 August 2007, we methodically searched a portion of the NFWR by snorkeling and lifting rocks. We located and captured six adult hellbenders, all with abnormalities/injuries (Table 6). Each individual hellbender was placed into a clean bucket filled with river water and then measured, weighed, and individually photographed. All C. a. bishopi were visually inspected for the presence of leeches, injuries, or abnormalities. The feet/limbs showing signs of infection (e.g., lesions, sores or exposed bone) were swabbed with sterile, buffered swabs. In addition, the lower lip of one individual with a raw sore was swabbed (Figure 2). Swabs were then streaked onto three different microbiological culture media: sheep's blood agar (SBA), a general all purpose growth medium that supports the culture of a large number of microorganisms and also indicates hemolytic activity; Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), primarily selective for halo-tolerant bacteria such as staphylococci; and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDX), primarily selective for fungi (Figure 1). Given the very small population of C. a. bishopi currently existing in the NFWR and given that no animals without abnormality/injury were captured throughout the duration of this study, two feet showing no signs of infection from two C. a. bishopi were swabbed in the same manner and served as uninfected controls. The swabs were streaked onto the different agar plates, and sample plate lids were immediately added and secured with tape. Secured plates were immediately placed into styrofoam coolers with ice packs and transported by vehicle to St. Louis, MO, and flown to the Microbiology Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) for microbial identification. Bacterial and fungal isolates were enumerated and then sub-cultured on the medium from the parent culture at room temperature. Bacterial isolates were identified using biochemical analysis with the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Bacterial isolates that could not be identified by the Vitek 2 system were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing using a MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Identification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were compared to those on the  () website for microorganisms. Speciation was reported for isolates having greater than 98% sequence similarity. Fungal isolates were identified by microscopic morphological characteristics [90]. Table 6.

    "results": "Results Our results reflect our strategy to optimize chances for successful culture of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by using three different media for each sample; blood agar (all purpose growth media), mannitol salts (differential and selective media), Sabouraud's (differential and selective media often used to isolate fungi) (Figure 1). Figure 1. Representative microbial flora cultured from C. a. bishopi on three different media. Open in a new tab Swabs from injured (or uninjured control) tissues of six adult hellbenders were streaked onto three different microbiological culture media: Sheep's blood agar (A–G), Mannitol Salt Agar (H), and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (I). * Indicates uninjured control sample. An evaluation of the microbial flora sampled from C. a. bishopi indicated the presence of common environmental flora from both abnormal/injured and uninjured limbs. A wide variety of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were isolated. While no consistent pattern of bacterial colonization was observed between uninjured and abnormal/injured body parts (Tables 1 and 2), several interesting microbial associations were observed. The genus Aeromonas was identified in 9 separate occasions, although the amphibian pathogenic species Aeromonas hydrophila, was identified only once from an abnormal/injured animal (NFWR 139 - lower lip). Likewise, certain organisms that can cause human infection were also identified, including the opportunistic pseudomonal pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NFWR 135 - right back limb), P. stutzeri (NFWR 134 - right back; NFWR- 135 right back), P. alcaligenes (NFWR – right front), and the pseudomonal-like pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (NFWR 136 – left front limb). In addition, the poultry pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer [44] was also isolated only from abnormal/injured animals. On rare occasion, one bacterial species would represent the vast majority of the colonies from a given abnormal/injured sample as exemplified by the known human pathogen Granulicatella adiacens (formerly Streptococcus adiacens; [45]), which represented 91% of the 163 bacterial isolates found on the blood agar plate associated with the NFWR 139 lower lip sample. When using Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, only fungi were isolated, except for one plate (from the injured animal NFWR 135 - left front limb) where 4 colonies of Kocuria kristinae (previously Micrococcus) were found, which is a common inhabitant on human skin that has been increasingly associated with infectious disease in humans [46].

    "discussion": "Discussion The C. a. bishopi population decline in the NFWR is well documented and of significant concern [42], [47], [48]. Many reasons for the decline in population and health of the Ozark Hellbender have been suggested, including flooding [39], [49] amphibian harvesting [42], the use of the anesthetic MS-222 (Tricane) [50], [51], the reintroduction and introduction of species including otters and trout [47], [52], habitat alteration and degradation [53], disease including those having a genetic, chemical, or infectious etiology [36], [41], [48], [50], [51], [53]–[61], and the interaction of these factors [47]. Many of these hypothesized causal agents of decline have been investigated to various degrees, yet disease research has largely been limited to B. dendrobatidis [59]–[61], and prior to our study, the microbial community associated with the abnormalities typifying the affected hellbenders had not been assessed. As a variety of pathogenic microbes have been linked to amphibian declines, it is critical that the microbial community be examined for all potential disease agents and that research not be initially limited to a single potential infectious agent until causation has been properly evaluated and established. While our microbiological evaluations in this study indicated common environmental organisms in both abnormal/injured and uninjured Ozark Hellbenders, several opportunistic pathogenic organisms were identified that were associated only with the abnormal tissue/injuries of C. a. bishopi, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, a known pathogen of amphibians [62], [63], Granulicatella adiacens [64], Stenotrophomonas malophilia [65], and a variety of opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonad species - P. aeruginosa [66], P. stutzeri [67] and P. alcaligenes [68]. These microbial pathogens are known to form biofilms in the environment and/or in vivo in the infected host. Several of the filamentous fungi isolated in this study, including Penicillium, Fusarium, and Cladosporidium are genera containing opportunistic pathogens that are known to be associated with environmental biofilms [69]–[72]. Multispecies biofilms may interact synergistically yielding an increased resistance to antibacterial agents [73]. While a possible cause and effect role for biofilms in disease progression observed in the Ozark Hellbenders is outside the scope of this study, this observation warrants investigation in future studies. The lack of isolation of the same organism from multiple wounds suggests that none of the organisms identified were the sole etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi. If the immune system of the injured C. a. bishopi were repressed, it is possible that a combination of the isolated opportunistic pathogens may have contributed to the observed tissue damage. The Gram positive opportunistic pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was isolated from one animal. While the presence of S. pneumoniae may be the result of contamination during collection or processing, the genus Streptococcus has been found by the EPA downstream of our NFWR research site. Reintroduced or introduced species may not only be a source of pathogenic microbes in the NFWR, but in some cases may also increase injury, and subsequently infection rates by creating open sores. River otters (Lutra or Lontra canadensis) used in reintroduction programs are known to carry a suite of pathogenic microbes, including Gram positive Streptococcus spp. and Gram negative Pseudomonas spp. [74]. Otters reintroduced into Missouri were sourced from Louisiana and could carry many different microbes which are not found in the streams of the Ozark Highlands [75]. We speculate that reintroduced otters may introduce pathogenic microbes into the environment through fecal transmission or direct contact with hellbenders, crayfish (the primary prey of both otters and hellbenders), or other species. In addition, river otters are capable of killing or injuring C. a. bishopi. Non-lethal injuries such as bites or scratches yielding open sores may provide a pathway for pathogens. Non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in the NFWR annually. These trout come from multiple hatcheries with multiple water sources and are transferred between hatcheries, which have known reoccurring water quality issues, including harboring pathogenic microorganisms [76]. While we know of no predation of C. a. bishopi by salmonids in the wild, hatchery-raised trout released into the NFWR and other water bodies may serve as a source for pathogens. Increased recreational use of NFWR may also be a source of hellbender injury and pathogenic microbes. Canoeing and other water activities may disturb or dislodge habitat rocks, inadvertently injuring hellbenders located underneath [43]. Humans may also be a source of pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, one of the opportunistic bacteria found in this study. The rapid regeneration that historically typified injured hellbenders was not apparent in recent studies of the NFWR population. Based on data collected in 1969, hellbender injuries (i.e., tail holes) induced by tagging healed completely with no sign of infection and no visible scars within two months (Nickerson unpublished data). The remarkable regenerative capacity of salamanders has been known since first reported by Spallanzani in 1769 [77]. Regenerative studies have included phylogenetic, seasonal, and environmental analysis of limb regeneration [77]–[79]. Environmental factors that have been considered to affect regeneration include temperature, diet, photoperiod, parasitism, infection, and quality of terrestrial and aquatic microhabitats [79]. Human-induced alterations to the NFWR and surrounding landscape have resulted in changes to the physical-chemical properties of the NFWR, including nutrient-loading, introduction of estrogenic chemical levels, algal blooms, and a microbial content deemed unsafe for full body contact by state and federal agencies [43], [80], [81]. Previous studies investigating the impact of human activities on NFWR water quality revealed relatively high concentrations of total phosphorus (6–52 µg L−1) and total nitrogen (0.35–3.06 mg L−1) in the 4.6 km research site originally investigated by Nickerson and Mays [80], [81]. The impact of this type of increased nutrient level on the hellbenders was investigated by Solis et al., which focused on a historically populated area, located 11.3 km downstream of the Nickerson and Mays site [80], [82]. Not unexpectedly, the site studied by Solis et al. indicated that nutrient concentrations (including total phosphorous and nitrogen) exceeded the EPA recommended criteria in two thirds of the samples [80]. However, a direct correlation between these elevated levels and abnormalities/disease of the hellbenders was not supported, as all individual concentrations of nutrients and organic chemicals were at much lower levels than any laboratory and field experiments shown to have deleterious effects on amphibians [80]. Likewise, serum samples from C. a. bishopi collected at the Solis et al. site were analyzed for possible endocrine disrupting chemicals, however, none were detected at levels above the EPA and Missouri Clean Water Commission criteria for aquatic organisms [82]. Thus, the direct impact of increased chemical levels on the hellbenders remains inconclusive. The impact of eutrophication associated with human activity was further investigated in a periphyton survey of the NFWR in 2006 to determine if changes in the periphyton communities could be a factor in the Ozark Hellbender decline [81]. Some Periphyton, such as cyanobacteria (i.e., blue-green algae) may cause cutaneous damage, neural and hepatic effects, tumor induction, diarrhea, vomiting, respiratory dysfunction, convulsions and occasionally death [83]. The periphyton community within the NFWR 4.6 km Nickerson and Mays research section consisted of diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria [81]. The green algae Cladophora spp. achieved relative abundances of >90% of the total periphyton community [81]. Blooms of the benthic, filamentous Cladophora spp. are a visible indicator of eutrophication and are linked to phosphorus concentration with 20 µg µL−1 being the threshold for Cladophora dominance [84], [85]. High nitrate concentrations are an issue with karst topography such as that in the NFWR drainage [81] and increases in human usage and poor sewage facilities. Large Cladophora spp. blooms have been a component of the NFWR since at least 1968, but have increased over the decades and large floating algal masses seen during recent summers were not a component of the NFWR 4.6 km section during the early surveys [36]. Increased algal levels are known to increase both biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance, and Cladophora spp mats maintain higher E. coli densities than the surrounding aquatic habitat [86], [87]. Green algae (Cladophora sp.) mats may have almost ubiquitous populations of E. coli and enterococci, which may survive at least six months of drying [88]. A 2007 study of total coliform (TC) bacteria and Escherichia coli content was conducted at multiple sites and habitats in the NFWR between Mark Twain National Forest Campground Access and Norfork Reservoir, as well as springs which flow into the NFWR [89]. Total coliform levels exceeded the values deemed safe for full body contact by Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) in 70 of 94 individual water samples and 25 of the 94 samples also surpassed concentrations of E. coli deemed safe for full body contact [89]. Our results do not preclude that an infectious agent caused or exacerbated the tissue damage observed in Ozark Hellbenders, as other microorganisms, which would not grow on the media used in this experiment, may have been present (i.e., the microbial diversity observed in this study is likely a subset of the total microbial diversity). Alternatively, if the immune system of the abnormal/injured C. a. bishopi was suppressed, many of the opportunistic pathogens that were isolated in this study, alone or in combination, may have caused infection which was responsible for or served to exacerbate the tissue damage. As such, the increase in incidence of abnormalities/injuries and retardation of tissue regeneration may have multiple contributing factors including changes in the Ozark Hellbenders' susceptibility to infection and exposure to microorganisms. The Ozark hellbender is a federally listed endangered species that has yet to have successfully reproduced in captivity. The unavailability of healthy Ozark hellbenders, small sample size, and conservation status precluded our ability to evaluate all of Koch's Postulates. However, this study provides the most complete analysis of potential microbial stressors on Ozark hellbenders to date and places these findings in the context of habitat alterations. Follow up studies are planned to identify causative mechanism(s) and environmental factors that are contributing to health and population declines in this endangered species.",

Copyright notice ID: 3242767 PMID: 22205979 Abstract Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.Introduction The amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees [1], including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution, increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation, introduced species and disease, including infectious disease [2], [3]. Although evidence of disease in amphibian populations is not new, early literature on amphibian health in natural populations is quite scattered, deals primarily with anurans and/or local problems, or was initiated because of concerns related to supply and demand and decline of commercial harvest [4]–[6]. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, various biological supply houses noted problems in the commercial supply of amphibians causing Maugh [7] to comment on “the apparent short supply and diseased state of amphibians collected in nature”. The review of mycoses of amphibians by Reichenback-Klinke and Elkan [8] primarily focuses on Basidiobolus ranarum and Saprolegnia parasitica and indicates the dearth of knowledge relating to the distribution and importance of microfungi associated with amphibians. With few exceptions, this void continued for the next two decades [9]–[12]. The impetus for research on amphibian microbes became a major focal point of the 1st World Herpetology Congress in Canterbury, England in 1989, where herpetologists shared their observations on declining frog populations and developed initial strategies to investigate the potential problems. The discovery that the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a zoosporic fungus related to infectious oomycete water molds, Saprolegnia spp., was capable of causing lethal dermatitis in amphibians led to a proliferation of studies [13]. After reviewing studies of microbes implicated in amphibian population declines, including chytridiomycosis, Ranavirus disease, saprolegniosis and Ribieroia spp., Daszak et al. [14] concluded that “available data provide the clearest link for the fungal disease amphibian chytridiomycosis”. Herpetological Review dedicated an entire section to amphibian chytridiomycosis geographical distribution [15]–[17]. The advances in research on the secretions, structure, and functions of amphibian integument and their products reveal a remarkable complexity of bioactive secretions and diversity of amines, peptides, alkaloids, bufodienolides, and other compounds [18], [19]. The presence of antimicrobial agents in amphibian skin hypothesized by Csordas and Michl [20] and Croce et al. [21] has led to an increased interest in the relationship of the bacteria and fungi present in the skin of amphibians and the antimicrobial peptides and metabolites that they produce [22]–[30]. Some of these peptides and alkaloids can inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi [31], [32] and common cutaneous bacteria from the terrestrial salamander Plethodon cinerus can inhibit pathogenic fungi [33]. Evidence also suggests that symbiotic bacteria may contribute to innate immune defense of some amphibians [30]. While evidence suggests that these antimicrobial compounds and symbiotic bacteria can provide some level of protection for amphibians against microbial invaders [30]–[33], the connection between disease and amphibian decline has been confirmed for some amphibian populations [34]. However, long-term amphibian studies, especially those including population and environmental data, are so rare that we have very few data to support many claims related to decline or changes in, or the health of, wild amphibian populations [35]. One long-term study subject, the Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganensis bishopi, and its habitat within a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River (NFWR), has been the subject of numerous investigations since the intensive 110 day surveys conducted during 1969–1971 [36], [37]. In 1969, the 4.6 km research section within the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, was a crystalline, substantially spring-fed stream located in the least densely human populated area of the second least densely populated county in the state (9 people/sq mi; [38]). Only one rarely used sportsman's cabin graced the banks of the research section in 1969. The springs and occasionally the river were used as drinking water by some locals and visitors. From 1969 to 1980, 169 days of skin-diving surveys, coupled with environmental sampling, were conducted in this section, including some in every year and within every calendar month, but not every month of every year [39]. Population and ecological studies of the aquatic Ozark Hellbender C. a. bishopi and its habitat were conducted in this section during 1969–1971 [36], [37]. Other ecological studies included year-round water quality, benthic habitat, macro-invertebrate structure, cottid fish diet studies, and numerous shorter-term studies [36], [40]. These early studies in the NFWR found an immense and healthy population of C. a. bishopi, as many as 428 individuals/km, and almost no abnormalities/injuries. Only 2.9% of 479 individuals observed in 1969 were abnormal/injured and they exhibited rapid regeneration capabilities [36], [39], [41]. Additional surveys between 1972 to 1980 continued to show immense and healthy populations of Ozark Hellbenders [27], [42]. All surveys during this time period ranged from between 9–12 individual Ozark hellbenders collected per hour per person (Nickerson et al, unpublished data). Reassessment of the ecological characteristics of the NFWR conducted in 2004–2007 revealed extensive habitat alteration and degradation, including increased land development, siltation, sedimentation, and water quality degradation [43]. Community changes included algal and nuisance aquatic vegetation blooms, otter establishment, and fish and macroinvertebrate community alterations [43]. Canoe use within the NFWR significantly increased [43]. Intensive surveys of the NFWR hellbender population conducted in 2005 yielded only 55 individuals, of which 26 (i.e., 47%) had visible abnormalities/injuries, including loss of limbs, limbs with exposed bones, and degeneration of other tissues which did not regenerate or had remarkably retarded regeneration (J. Briggler, unpublished data). The high prevalence of abnormalities/injuries and the lack of the historically characteristic (rapid) regeneration of injured/affected tissue in hellbenders in the NFWR was the impetus for our examination of the microbial community associated with the observed abnormalities/injuries.Results Our results reflect our strategy to optimize chances for successful culture of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by using three different media for each sample; blood agar (all purpose growth media), mannitol salts (differential and selective media), Sabouraud's (differential and selective media often used to isolate fungi) (Figure 1). Figure 1. Representative microbial flora cultured from C. a. bishopi on three different media. Open in a new tab Swabs from injured (or uninjured control) tissues of six adult hellbenders were streaked onto three different microbiological culture media: Sheep's blood agar (A–G), Mannitol Salt Agar (H), and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (I). * Indicates uninjured control sample.An evaluation of the microbial flora sampled from C. a. bishopi indicated the presence of common environmental flora from both abnormal/injured and uninjured limbs. A wide variety of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria were isolated. While no consistent pattern of bacterial colonization was observed between uninjured and abnormal/injured body parts (Tables 1 and 2), several interesting microbial associations were observed. The genus Aeromonas was identified in 9 separate occasions, although the amphibian pathogenic species Aeromonas hydrophila, was identified only once from an abnormal/injured animal (NFWR 139 - lower lip). Likewise, certain organisms that can cause human infection were also identified, including the opportunistic pseudomonal pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NFWR 135 - right back limb), P. stutzeri (NFWR 134 - right back; NFWR- 135 right back), P. alcaligenes (NFWR – right front), and the pseudomonal-like pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (NFWR 136 – left front limb). In addition, the poultry pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer [44] was also isolated only from abnormal/injured animals. On rare occasion, one bacterial species would represent the vast majority of the colonies from a given abnormal/injured sample as exemplified by the known human pathogen Granulicatella adiacens (formerly Streptococcus adiacens; [45]), which represented 91% of the 163 bacterial isolates found on the blood agar plate associated with the NFWR 139 lower lip sample. When using Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, only fungi were isolated, except for one plate (from the injured animal NFWR 135 - left front limb) where 4 colonies of Kocuria kristinae (previously Micrococcus) were found, which is a common inhabitant on human skin that has been increasingly associated with infectious disease in humans [46].

NFWR = North Fork of White River samples.Discussion The C. a. bishopi population decline in the NFWR is well documented and of significant concern [42], [47], [48]. Many reasons for the decline in population and health of the Ozark Hellbender have been suggested, including flooding [39], [49] amphibian harvesting [42], the use of the anesthetic MS-222 (Tricane) [50], [51], the reintroduction and introduction of species including otters and trout [47], [52], habitat alteration and degradation [53], disease including those having a genetic, chemical, or infectious etiology [36], [41], [48], [50], [51], [53]–[61], and the interaction of these factors [47]. Many of these hypothesized causal agents of decline have been investigated to various degrees, yet disease research has largely been limited to B. dendrobatidis [59]–[61], and prior to our study, the microbial community associated with the abnormalities typifying the affected hellbenders had not been assessed. As a variety of pathogenic microbes have been linked to amphibian declines, it is critical that the microbial community be examined for all potential disease agents and that research not be initially limited to a single potential infectious agent until causation has been properly evaluated and established. While our microbiological evaluations in this study indicated common environmental organisms in both abnormal/injured and uninjured Ozark Hellbenders, several opportunistic pathogenic organisms were identified that were associated only with the abnormal tissue/injuries of C. a. bishopi, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, a known pathogen of amphibians [62], [63], Granulicatella adiacens [64], Stenotrophomonas malophilia [65], and a variety of opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonad species - P. aeruginosa [66], P. stutzeri [67] and P. alcaligenes [68]. These microbial pathogens are known to form biofilms in the environment and/or in vivo in the infected host. Several of the filamentous fungi isolated in this study, including Penicillium, Fusarium, and Cladosporidium are genera containing opportunistic pathogens that are known to be associated with environmental biofilms [69]–[72]. Multispecies biofilms may interact synergistically yielding an increased resistance to antibacterial agents [73]. While a possible cause and effect role for biofilms in disease progression observed in the Ozark Hellbenders is outside the scope of this study, this observation warrants investigation in future studies. The lack of isolation of the same organism from multiple wounds suggests that none of the organisms identified were the sole etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi. If the immune system of the injured C. a. bishopi were repressed, it is possible that a combination of the isolated opportunistic pathogens may have contributed to the observed tissue damage. The Gram positive opportunistic pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was isolated from one animal. While the presence of S. pneumoniae may be the result of contamination during collection or processing, the genus Streptococcus has been found by the EPA downstream of our NFWR research site. Reintroduced or introduced species may not only be a source of pathogenic microbes in the NFWR, but in some cases may also increase injury, and subsequently infection rates by creating open sores. River otters (Lutra or Lontra canadensis) used in reintroduction programs are known to carry a suite of pathogenic microbes, including Gram positive Streptococcus spp. and Gram negative Pseudomonas spp. [74]. Otters reintroduced into Missouri were sourced from Louisiana and could carry many different microbes which are not found in the streams of the Ozark Highlands [75]. We speculate that reintroduced otters may introduce pathogenic microbes into the environment through fecal transmission or direct contact with hellbenders, crayfish (the primary prey of both otters and hellbenders), or other species. In addition, river otters are capable of killing or injuring C. a. bishopi. Non-lethal injuries such as bites or scratches yielding open sores may provide a pathway for pathogens. Non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in the NFWR annually. These trout come from multiple hatcheries with multiple water sources and are transferred between hatcheries, which have known reoccurring water quality issues, including harboring pathogenic microorganisms [76]. While we know of no predation of C. a. bishopi by salmonids in the wild, hatchery-raised trout released into the NFWR and other water bodies may serve as a source for pathogens. Increased recreational use of NFWR may also be a source of hellbender injury and pathogenic microbes. Canoeing and other water activities may disturb or dislodge habitat rocks, inadvertently injuring hellbenders located underneath [43]. Humans may also be a source of pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, one of the opportunistic bacteria found in this study. The rapid regeneration that historically typified injured hellbenders was not apparent in recent studies of the NFWR population. Based on data collected in 1969, hellbender injuries (i.e., tail holes) induced by tagging healed completely with no sign of infection and no visible scars within two months (Nickerson unpublished data). The remarkable regenerative capacity of salamanders has been known since first reported by Spallanzani in 1769 [77]. Regenerative studies have included phylogenetic, seasonal, and environmental analysis of limb regeneration [77]–[79]. Environmental factors that have been considered to affect regeneration include temperature, diet, photoperiod, parasitism, infection, and quality of terrestrial and aquatic microhabitats [79]. Human-induced alterations to the NFWR and surrounding landscape have resulted in changes to the physical-chemical properties of the NFWR, including nutrient-loading, introduction of estrogenic chemical levels, algal blooms, and a microbial content deemed unsafe for full body contact by state and federal agencies [43], [80], [81]. Previous studies investigating the impact of human activities on NFWR water quality revealed relatively high concentrations of total phosphorus (6–52 µg L−1) and total nitrogen (0.35–3.06 mg L−1) in the 4.6 km research site originally investigated by Nickerson and Mays [80], [81]. The impact of this type of increased nutrient level on the hellbenders was investigated by Solis et al., which focused on a historically populated area, located 11.3 km downstream of the Nickerson and Mays site [80], [82]. Not unexpectedly, the site studied by Solis et al. indicated that nutrient concentrations (including total phosphorous and nitrogen) exceeded the EPA recommended criteria in two thirds of the samples [80]. However, a direct correlation between these elevated levels and abnormalities/disease of the hellbenders was not supported, as all individual concentrations of nutrients and organic chemicals were at much lower levels than any laboratory and field experiments shown to have deleterious effects on amphibians [80]. Likewise, serum samples from C. a. bishopi collected at the Solis et al. site were analyzed for possible endocrine disrupting chemicals, however, none were detected at levels above the EPA and Missouri Clean Water Commission criteria for aquatic organisms [82]. Thus, the direct impact of increased chemical levels on the hellbenders remains inconclusive. The impact of eutrophication associated with human activity was further investigated in a periphyton survey of the NFWR in 2006 to determine if changes in the periphyton communities could be a factor in the Ozark Hellbender decline [81]. Some Periphyton, such as cyanobacteria (i.e., blue-green algae) may cause cutaneous damage, neural and hepatic effects, tumor induction, diarrhea, vomiting, respiratory dysfunction, convulsions and occasionally death [83]. The periphyton community within the NFWR 4.6 km Nickerson and Mays research section consisted of diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria [81]. The green algae Cladophora spp. achieved relative abundances of >90% of the total periphyton community [81]. Blooms of the benthic, filamentous Cladophora spp. are a visible indicator of eutrophication and are linked to phosphorus concentration with 20 µg µL−1 being the threshold for Cladophora dominance [84], [85]. High nitrate concentrations are an issue with karst topography such as that in the NFWR drainage [81] and increases in human usage and poor sewage facilities. Large Cladophora spp. blooms have been a component of the NFWR since at least 1968, but have increased over the decades and large floating algal masses seen during recent summers were not a component of the NFWR 4.6 km section during the early surveys [36]. Increased algal levels are known to increase both biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance, and Cladophora spp mats maintain higher E. coli densities than the surrounding aquatic habitat [86], [87]. Green algae (Cladophora sp.) mats may have almost ubiquitous populations of E. coli and enterococci, which may survive at least six months of drying [88]. A 2007 study of total coliform (TC) bacteria and Escherichia coli content was conducted at multiple sites and habitats in the NFWR between Mark Twain National Forest Campground Access and Norfork Reservoir, as well as springs which flow into the NFWR [89]. Total coliform levels exceeded the values deemed safe for full body contact by Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) in 70 of 94 individual water samples and 25 of the 94 samples also surpassed concentrations of E. coli deemed safe for full body contact [89]. Our results do not preclude that an infectious agent caused or exacerbated the tissue damage observed in Ozark Hellbenders, as other microorganisms, which would not grow on the media used in this experiment, may have been present (i.e., the microbial diversity observed in this study is likely a subset of the total microbial diversity). Alternatively, if the immune system of the abnormal/injured C. a. bishopi was suppressed, many of the opportunistic pathogens that were isolated in this study, alone or in combination, may have caused infection which was responsible for or served to exacerbate the tissue damage. As such, the increase in incidence of abnormalities/injuries and retardation of tissue regeneration may have multiple contributing factors including changes in the Ozark Hellbenders' susceptibility to infection and exposure to microorganisms. The Ozark hellbender is a federally listed endangered species that has yet to have successfully reproduced in captivity. The unavailability of healthy Ozark hellbenders, small sample size, and conservation status precluded our ability to evaluate all of Koch's Postulates. However, this study provides the most complete analysis of potential microbial stressors on Ozark hellbenders to date and places these findings in the context of habitat alterations. Follow up studies are planned to identify causative mechanism(s) and environmental factors that are contributing to health and population declines in this endangered species.Materials and Methods The Ozark Hellbender, C. a. bishopi, is now listed as endangered and populations have been extirpated and face extinction in much of the former range. The NFWR currently supports only a very small population of C. a. bishopi, of which about 50% within the original NFWR research section of Nickerson and Mays [36], [37] have substantial abnormalities/injuries (J. Briggler unpublished data). On 17 August 2007, we methodically searched a portion of the NFWR by snorkeling and lifting rocks. We located and captured six adult hellbenders, all with abnormalities/injuries (Table 6). Each individual hellbender was placed into a clean bucket filled with river water and then measured, weighed, and individually photographed. All C. a. bishopi were visually inspected for the presence of leeches, injuries, or abnormalities. The feet/limbs showing signs of infection (e.g., lesions, sores or exposed bone) were swabbed with sterile, buffered swabs. In addition, the lower lip of one individual with a raw sore was swabbed (Figure 2). Swabs were then streaked onto three different microbiological culture media: sheep's blood agar (SBA), a general all purpose growth medium that supports the culture of a large number of microorganisms and also indicates hemolytic activity; Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), primarily selective for halo-tolerant bacteria such as staphylococci; and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDX), primarily selective for fungi (Figure 1). Given the very small population of C. a. bishopi currently existing in the NFWR and given that no animals without abnormality/injury were captured throughout the duration of this study, two feet showing no signs of infection from two C. a. bishopi were swabbed in the same manner and served as uninfected controls. The swabs were streaked onto the different agar plates, and sample plate lids were immediately added and secured with tape. Secured plates were immediately placed into styrofoam coolers with ice packs and transported by vehicle to St. Louis, MO, and flown to the Microbiology Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) for microbial identification. Bacterial and fungal isolates were enumerated and then sub-cultured on the medium from the parent culture at room temperature. Bacterial isolates were identified using biochemical analysis with the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Bacterial isolates that could not be identified by the Vitek 2 system were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing using a MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Identification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were compared to those on the  () website for microorganisms. Speciation was reported for isolates having greater than 98% sequence similarity. Fungal isolates were identified by microscopic morphological characteristics [90]. Table 6.

Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public. The microgravity environment associated with spaceflight is unique and has a profound effect on both host and pathogen cells, with potential implications for infectious disease. From the host point of view, astronauts experience a compromised immune response under spaceflight conditions, as reflected in cellular alterations of both the innate and adaptive immune systems (23, 26, 40). Spaceflight has been shown to alter the response of monocytes, isolated from astronauts preflight and in flight, to Gram-negative toxins (27). Further, simulation of aspects of this microgravity-associated decreased immune response, using the hind limb unloaded mouse model, showed an enhanced susceptibility of these animals to bacterial infection (3, 6). From the pathogen's perspective, bacterial obligate and opportunistic pathogens have been found to exhibit enhanced stress resistance phenotypes following growth under both true spaceflight and microgravity analogue conditions (13, 30, 33, 46-49). In response to the spaceflight environment, global transcriptional and proteomic changes were observed for the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in the complex medium Lennox L broth base (LB), which were associated with an increased virulence in a murine model of infection (46). Moreover, the small RNA binding protein Hfq was identified as a major transcriptional regulator of S. Typhimurium responses to the spaceflight environment. A subsequent study demonstrated that cultivation of S. Typhimurium in M9 minimal medium abolished the spaceflight-induced virulence (47). While M9 spaceflight cultures of S. Typhimurium exhibited virulence characteristics dramatically different from those in LB, microarray and proteomic analyses revealed a role for Hfq in both the M9 and LB spaceflight stimulons (47). Complementary experiments using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, in which cells are cultured in a microgravity analogue low-fluid-shear environment (i.e., low-shear modeled microgravity [LSMMG]), identified that a low phosphate concentration in LB could be the origin of the spaceflight-induced virulence of S. Typhimurium (47). Interestingly, LSMMG and spaceflight induced similar increased virulence when LB medium was used, and overlapping gene expression profiles, including Hfq and members of the Hfq regulon, were obtained for both growth conditions (47). The latter indicates that molecular and phenotypic similarities between LSMMG and spaceflight conditions could be attributed to the analogous low-fluid-shear environment. Recently, the global transcriptional response of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to LSMMG was determined (13). As a ubiquitous organism colonizing both environmental niches and the human body, P. aeruginosa is found in spacecrafts and has previously caused infections in astronauts (8, 24, 35, 43). Cultivation of P. aeruginosa in the LSMMG environment of the RWV induced molecular pathways known to be of importance for virulence, compared to control conditions. In agreement with the microarray data, an increased production of the exopolysaccharide alginate, enhanced resistance to heat and oxidative stress, and a decreased oxygen transfer rate were observed. The alternative sigma factor AlgU and Hfq were both proposed as important mediators of the LSMMG response in P. aeruginosa. In addition, by comparing the behavior of P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG to that in a higher-fluid-shear control at body temperature, clinically relevant traits were found to be induced, such as biofilm formation, rhamnolipid production, and the C4-homoserine lactone quorum sensing system (12). Collectively, these data indicate that low fluid shear has an impact on the behavior, and possibly on the pathogenicity, of P. aeruginosa. Importantly, low-fluid-shear zones are believed to be encountered by pathogens during their natural course of infection in vivo, including in the intestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts (12, 34). Therefore, in addition to the importance of spaceflight research for the evaluation of infectious disease risk during long-term missions, this research field has the potential to provide novel insights in the role of fluid shear in virulence and the disease process. This study describes the global transcriptional and translational responses of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to the microgravity environment of spaceflight. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa and if evolutionarily conserved pathways in common with those of spaceflight-grown S. Typhimurium were regulated in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the spaceflight (this study) and LSMMG (13) responses of P. aeruginosa were compared and revealed interesting similarities. In addition to the role of low fluid shear in these observations, the possible involvement of the adopted experimental setup is discussed. The present study is the first to assess the molecular response of an important opportunistic pathogen following growth under actual spaceflight conditions and provides important insights into the evaluation and, eventually, the prevention of P. aeruginosa infections during spaceflight missions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strain and growth media. A derivative of the wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15692), which contained a gentamicin resistance cassette in the attB site, was used for the spaceflight experiment. The gentamicin-resistant strain was constructed through homologous recombination as described previously (38). P. aeruginosa PAO1 was grown in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml gentamicin in the spaceflight hardware (see below) to avoid growth of any contaminants. The bacterial inoculum (1.5 × 108 CFU/ml) in the spaceflight hardware was suspended in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and remained viable but static (not growing) during launch and until 9 days into the flight. After this time, growth was initiated by the addition of LB as described below. Cells were fixed in flight using the RNA and protein fixative RNA Later II (Ambion). At 2.5 h after landing of the space shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), samples were recovered and subsequently used for whole-genome transcriptional microarray and proteomic analyses. In each case, the flight culture samples were compared with synchronous culture samples grown under identical conditions on the ground at KSC using coordinated activation and termination times (by means of real-time communications with the shuttle astronauts) in an insulated room that maintained temperature and humidity levels identical to those on the shuttle (orbital environment simulator).Experimental setup adopted for spaceflight culturing. Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was initiated in flight, and cells were cultured in space and on the ground in specialized hardware termed the fluid-processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously (46, 47) (Fig. 1). Briefly, FPAs are glass barrels, containing a bevel on the side, in which rubber stoppers are inserted for compartmentalization. The bottom stopper contained a gas exchange membrane. Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were coated with a silicone lubricant (Sigmacote; Sigma) and autoclaved separately before assembly. The subsequent insertion of rubber stoppers into the FPAs resulted in the creation of three separate compartments which contained, from top to bottom, (i) RNA Later II fixative (2.5 ml), (ii) bacteria suspended in PBS (0.5 ml), and (iii) LB culture medium (2 ml). The last compartment was created at the level of the bevel. Each FPA was loaded into a lexan sheet that contained a gas-permeable membrane at the bottom, and eight FPAs were subsequently loaded into larger containers, termed group activation packs (GAPs). This experimental setup created a triple level of containment for crew safety. At specific time points in flight, an astronaut manually inserted a hand crank into the end of the GAP and turned it, which pushed down on a pressure plate underneath, resulting in a plunging action on the rubber stoppers of each FPA. This plunging action, which allowed for mixing of fluids between different compartments through the bevel, was performed twice in flight. The first plunging action, referred to as activation, served to add LB growth medium to the cells, and the second (following a 25-h growth period) added fixative to preserve samples for gene expression analysis. All phases of the experiment on orbit were conducted at ambient temperature (23°C). Shuttle landing occurred at approximately 58 h postfixation. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Diagram of a fluid-processing apparatus (FPA) used as hardware for the spaceflight experiment. In the preactivation setting of the FPA (setting 1), the bacterial inoculum (suspended in PBS) is separated from the culture medium and fixative agent (RNA Later II) through rubber stoppers. The FPAs are brought on board the shuttle in their preactivation setting until activation in low-Earth orbit. Upon activation in flight (setting 2), the plunger is pushed downwards in order to bring the bacteria in contact with the medium, allowing for bacterial growth; the plunger is pushed until the middle stopper is located at the top part of the bevel. After 25 h of bacterial growth (setting 3), the plunger is pushed again in order to bring the middle stopper below the top part of the bevel, which brings the fixative in contact with the bacterial culture.RNA extraction, labeling, and Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Total cellular RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Conversion to fluorescently labeled cDNA, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip arrays, and image acquisition were performed as previously described (29). Raw Affymetrix data were normalized and processed utilizing tools identical to those for the study of P. aeruginosa PAO1 under microgravity analogue conditions (13). The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used for multiple-testing correction (7). Only fold change ratios with P values below 0.05 (corrected for multiple testing) were considered statistically significant. Microarray analysis was performed on all three biological replicates.Protein identification analysis. Proteins from spaceflight and ground cell lysates were precipitated with acetone and subjected to multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis using the tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-dual nano-liquid chromatography technique (11, 37). Tandem mass spectra of peptides were analyzed with TurboSEQUEST version 3.1 (18) and XTandem (14) software. Data were further processed and organized using the Scaffold program. A probability threshold of 90% was adopted, and only proteins present in at least two biological replicates were considered expressed. Spectra were also assessed for good quality based on TurboSEQUEST correlation and DeltaCorrelation scores as previously described (11).Biostatistics. To calculate the overlap of up- and downregulated genes between P. aeruginosa and S. Typhimurium under spaceflight and simulated microgravity culture conditions, homology was determined using the BLAST software (blastp) (1). Genes in different organisms were defined as orthologues when they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) a cutoff on the BLAST E value of 1e−10, (ii) a minimal alignment coverage of 80% of the shortest DNA or protein sequence, (iii) a minimal sequence identity of 35%, and (iv) appearance as each other's reciprocal best BLAST hit. The statistical significance of the number of overlapping genes between different species and conditions was determined using the hypergeometric distribution method (20).Microarray data accession number. The microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database () (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=vdmfveeoysewghy&acc=GSE22684) under accession number GSE22684.RESULTS P. aeruginosa PAO1 transcriptome and proteome in response to spaceflight. (i) General observations. Transcriptional analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown and fixed under spaceflight conditions revealed the induction of 52 genes and the downregulation of 115 genes (2-fold threshold; P < 0.05) compared to those in identical synchronous ground control samples (Table 1). The genes that were differentially regulated under spaceflight conditions were distributed throughout the P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome and were often adjacent, indicating organization in transcriptional units (operons). Based on functional classification of differentially expressed genes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (25), several categories were significantly (P < 0.05) overrepresented in either the up- or downregulated gene group. The functional category that was significantly more represented under spaceflight conditions was nitrogen metabolism, while downregulated gene categories comprised purine and pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome synthesis.

metabolism are indicated with “×” (n = 3; P < 0.05; fold change, ≥2. By means of MudPIT analysis, 40 proteins were identified in ground and spaceflight samples (present in at least two replicates), among which 28 were differentially expressed (Table 2). Seven of these 28 proteins were also differentially regulated at the transcriptional level. TABLE 2. Proteome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown under spaceflight versus ground conditions Open in a new tab a Black cells indicate the proteins expressed in flight samples and not in ground samples, gray stands for proteins expressed in ground samples and not in flight samples, and white cells are for proteins expressed in both ground and spaceflight samples. X, proteins that were also found differentially expressed at the transcriptomic level; H, proteins under the control of Hfq.(ii) Hfq and the Hfq regulon. The gene encoding the RNA binding protein Hfq and genes under the control of Hfq were differentially expressed under spaceflight conditions. More specifically, 13.4% of the genes from the previously described Hfq regulon (42) were induced (17 of 38 genes) or downregulated (21 of 38 genes) in response to spaceflight, accounting for 23% of the P. aeruginosa spaceflight stimulon. The overlap between the spaceflight data set and the Hfq regulon was significant (P < 0.05), indicating that this transcriptional regulator, at least in part, mediated the spaceflight response of P. aeruginosa. While the downregulation of Hfq under spaceflight conditions presumably resulted in the downregulation of genes under positive control of Hfq (such as sigX, adk, and fabA) and the upregulation of genes under negative control of Hfq (such as bkdA2, bdhA, and glcC), other genes showed a direction of fold change opposite to what would be expected based upon the described Hfq regulon. Examples include the upregulation of nirS, chiC, and rhlA, which have been documented to be under positive control of Hfq under conventional culture conditions (42). This finding indicates that other (post)transcriptional or posttranslational regulators (or regulatory networks) may have played a role in the differential expression of these genes in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. Additionally, three proteins whose mRNA expression levels are controlled by Hfq (i.e., PA0070, PA0456, and PA1555) were found to be differentially expressed at the proteomic level.(iii) Anaerobic metabolism. The majority of genes that were upregulated under spaceflight conditions (60%) were associated with growth under anaerobic conditions (Table 1) (19). Furthermore, 13% of the genes that were downregulated in spaceflight are known to be downregulated during anaerobic growth (19). Using hypergeometric distribution, the overlap between the genes induced under anaerobic conditions and the genes upregulated in spaceflight was significant (P < 0.05). Similarly, a significant overlap was found between genes downregulated during anaerobic growth and in spaceflight. Only a few genes which are typically induced under microaerophilic growth conditions (2) (i.e., PA4306, PA4352, rhlI, and PA1123) were differentially expressed in spaceflight compared to synchronous ground controls. Remarkably, genes involved in denitrification were among those with the highest fold inductions within this category. While genes encoding the nitrate reductase were not induced significantly, the mRNAs of genes encoding nitrite (nirMS), nitric oxide (norBC), and nitrous oxide reductases (nosRZ) were more abundant in spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa PAO1. Proteomic analysis of the P. aeruginosa cells grown in spaceflight revealed that 7 of the 28 differentially expressed proteins play a role in anaerobic growth. The downregulation of ArcA, an enzyme involved in the fermentation of arginine, was observed, as well as the downregulation of CcoP2 (PA1555) (10), a cytochrome with high affinity for oxygen. The latter is typically induced under microaerophilic conditions but not in the anaerobic mode of growth of P. aeruginosa (2).(iv) Virulence factors. The transcripts of several genes encoding known P. aeruginosa PAO1 virulence factors were induced in spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. Among others, the genes encoding the lectins PA-I and PA-IIL (lecA and lecB, respectively), the chitinase-encoding gene chiC, and the rhamnolipid-encoding gene rhlA were significantly induced. The lecA gene showed the highest fold induction in the gene list (6.3-fold). On the other hand, downregulation of genes encoding heat shock proteins (groES and hslU) and the N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) synthase (rhlI) was observed. As mentioned above, hfq, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in the virulence of P. aeruginosa, was downregulated during spaceflight.(v) Other functional categories. Of 115 genes that were downregulated under spaceflight conditions, 40 are involved in the synthesis of ribosomes. Genes involved in the dehydrogenation of succinate to fumarate (i.e., sdhBCD) and ATP synthesis (atpGH) were less expressed in spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa PAO1.Comparative bioinformatic analysis of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. Typhimurium spaceflight stimulons. In order to compare the gene expression profiles of P. aeruginosa (this study) and S. Typhimurium (46) following exposure to spaceflight conditions, orthologues of P. aeruginosa genes were identified in the S. Typhimurium genome. Of 167 differentially expressed genes in P. aeruginosa, 102 orthologues were identified in S. Typhimurium, among which 92 (of 115) belonged to the downregulated group and 10 (of 52) belonged to the upregulated gene list. A significant overlap was found for the downregulated genes of the two bacteria (P < 0.05) (Table 3). More specifically, 15 genes showed a common lower transcription in the spaceflight samples and in the synchronous ground controls, among which 9 encoded ribosomal subunits. Interestingly, hfq and bfrB (encoding bacterioferritin) were part of the overlapping genes and were identified as key role players in both the spaceflight- and LSMMG-induced responses of S. Typhimurium (46, 49). Despite the observation that the overlap between spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa and S. Typhimurium was significant, it is rather limited. Indeed, only 16% of the S. Typhimurium orthologues in P. aeruginosa were found to be commonly downregulated between the two bacteria. No overlap could be identified for the upregulated genes of P. aeruginosa and S. Typhimurium under spaceflight conditions. This is presumably because, in part, of the low presence of P. aeruginosa orthologues (for the upregulated genes) in the S. Typhimurium genome and because fewer genes were upregulated in response to spaceflight for both of these organisms. TABLE 3.

A small, but significant (P < 0.05), overlap of genes commonly upregulated in spaceflight- and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa was identified. These genes encode the hypothetical protein PA0534, a protein involved in microaerophilic/anaerobic metabolism (PA0200), the ATP binding protease component ClpA, and a hypothetical protein belonging to the Hfq regulon (PA2753). On the other hand, 35 genes that were found to be upregulated in LSMMG were downregulated under spaceflight conditions. The majority of these genes (27 of 35) could be categorized as being involved in the synthesis of ribosomes. Additionally, genes encoding citric acid cycle proteins (sdhB, PA2634), bacterioferritin (bfrB), a translational elongation factor (fusA1), a heat shock protein (HslU), the sigma factor RpoA, a hypothetical protein (PA0856), and a protein involved in glycolysis (PA3001) were downregulated in response to spaceflight culture but upregulated in LSMMG. In our previous study (13), LSMMG was found to induce several genes encoding hypothetical proteins in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Among these, only one hypothetical protein (i.e., PA2737) had not been reported as being differentially regulated under any studied condition and was proposed as potentially specific to the low-fluid-shear conditions of LSMMG. Interestingly, PA2737 was also significantly upregulated in spaceflight, albeit below the 2-fold threshold (1.7-fold).DISCUSSION Assessing the behavior and virulence potential of obligate and opportunistic pathogens aboard spacecraft and the International Space Station (ISS) is of central importance to evaluate the risk for infectious disease in the context of long-term manned missions. Furthermore, since bacteria encounter microgravity analogue low-fluid-shear forces in the host during their natural course of infection, bacterial spaceflight research can provide novel insights into the in vivo infection process. Indeed, spaceflight increased the virulence of S. Typhimurium, while global gene expression profiling revealed a general downregulation of key virulence genes in this pathogen (46, 47). The present study demonstrated for the first time that the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa responded to culture in the microgravity environment of spaceflight through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins. A significant part of the spaceflight stimulon was under the control of the RNA binding protein Hfq. Hfq is important for the virulence and stress resistance of several (opportunistic) pathogens, including P. aeruginosa PAO1 (17, 39, 41), by modulating the function and stability of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and interfering with their interactions with mRNAs (reviewed in references 31 and 44). Interestingly, Hfq was also found to be an important regulator in the responses of (i) P. aeruginosa to microgravity analogue low-fluid-shear conditions (LSMMG, using the RWV bioreactor) and (ii) S. Typhimurium to actual spaceflight and LSMMG conditions (13, 46, 49). Hence, Hfq is the first transcriptional regulator ever shown to be commonly involved in the spaceflight and LSMMG responses of two bacterial species. Among the P. aeruginosa genes with the highest fold inductions under spaceflight conditions were the genes encoding the lectins LecA and LecB. Lectins bind galactosides, play a role in the bacterial adhesion process to eukaryotic cells, and are thus important virulence factors in P. aeruginosa (21, 22). P. aeruginosa lectins have cytotoxic effects in human peripheral lymphocytes and respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and increase alveolar barrier permeability in vivo (4, 9). Lectin production in P. aeruginosa is regulated through the N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) quorum-sensing system (50), which has been previously reviewed (45). However, the downregulation of rhlI, the gene encoding the C4-HSL synthase, under spaceflight conditions was unexpected. Nevertheless, rhlA, which is dependent on C4-HSL quorum-sensing regulation and encodes the rhamnosyltransferase I involved in rhamnolipid surfactant biosynthesis, was induced during spaceflight culture. Rhamnolipids are glycolipidic surface-active molecules that have cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects in eukaryotic cells (5, 15, 32, 36). Interestingly, rhamnolipids and rhlA transcripts were also found in P. aeruginosa in larger amounts under low-fluid-shear compared to higher-fluid-shear growth conditions, using the RWV bioreactor (12). These data indicate that rhamnolipid production could be induced upon sensing of low fluid shear. Gene expression profiles of P. aeruginosa grown under spaceflight conditions also revealed the differential regulation of a significant fraction of genes involved in growth under oxygen-limiting conditions. Spaceflight induced mainly genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, which was reinforced by a lower expression in spaceflight samples of CcoP2, a cytochrome with high affinity for oxygen that is typically induced under microaerophilic conditions (2, 10). At the time of measurement, the most prominent way to cope with the apparent oxygen shortage under spaceflight conditions seemed to occur through denitrification and not through fermentation. Indeed, under oxygen-limiting conditions, P. aeruginosa switches to anaerobic respiration in the presence of the alternative electron acceptor nitrate or nitrite (16). The downregulation of ArcA, a protein involved in arginine fermentation, accentuates that fermentation was presumably not activated in spaceflight-grown bacteria. When comparing the gene expression profiles of P. aeruginosa grown in spaceflight and P. aeruginosa grown in LSMMG, a limited but significant overlap was found. Besides the role of Hfq and its regulon in the response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to both spaceflight and LSMMG (see above), a significant fraction of genes involved in both microaerophilic and anaerobic metabolism were commonly induced. In contrast to P. aeruginosa grown under spaceflight conditions, LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa induced genes involved in arginine and pyruvate fermentation, while denitrification did not appear to play a role in the LSMMG response of this bacterium. The observation that spaceflight samples were presumably more deprived of oxygen than LSMMG-grown bacteria, compared to their respective controls, could be explained by the fact that actual spaceflight conditions are characterized by even lower fluid shear levels than LSMMG conditions. Indeed, due to the absence of convection currents in microgravity, oxygen limitation will be more pronounced in space than in LSMMG. Furthermore, the role of the experimental setup needs to be considered. As depicted in Fig. 2, cells grown in the bioreactors used for growth of P. aeruginosa in LSMMG and spaceflight have different oxygen availabilities. While the bioreactors have a gas-permeable membrane, the membrane surface-to-volume ratio of FPA bioreactors (used in spaceflight) is 12 times lower than that of the RWVs (LSMMG) [based on the formula πr2/(πr2 × h) or 1/h, with r = radius and h = height]. Hence, oxygen availability overall will be higher in RWVs than in the FPA devices. It also needs to be mentioned that despite differences in aeration and fluid shear between the spaceflight and LSMMG studies, the RWV mimics only certain aspects of the spaceflight environment. Indeed, enhanced irradiation and vibration or potential direct effects of microgravity (such as effects on the cell or cellular components instead of on the extracellular environment) during spaceflight could lead to differences in gene and protein expression profiles between spaceflight and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, the RWV bioreactor was unable to mimic the complete repertoire of spaceflight-induced alterations in P. aeruginosa. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Schematic representation of the different hardware used for cultivation of P. aeruginosa under microgravity analogue conditions (LSMMG versus control, using RWV bioreactors) and under spaceflight conditions (spaceflight versus ground, using FPA devices). The anticipated oxygen gradients under each condition are indicated, ranging from high (yellow) to low (red) oxygen levels. The oxygen gradient estimations are based on (i) the low-fluid-shear conditions encountered under the different conditions and (ii) the surface-to-volume ratio of RWV and FPA bioreactors.Since the present study was conducted by growing P. aeruginosa in a liquid environment under spaceflight conditions, our results are relevant mainly to the assessment of bacterial virulence in fluid niches of the spacecraft. Indeed, astronauts are in regular contact with water-containing sources that could be contaminated with P. aeruginosa, such as drinking water, rinseless shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, and water for laundry. Similarly, water-related sites in the hospital environment are most likely to harbor P. aeruginosa (e.g., faucets, showers, medication, disinfectants, mouthwash, and other hygiene products) and are at the origin of a significant number of nosocomial infections (28). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa is occasionally part of the normal human flora of the mouth, pharynx, anterior urethra, and lower gastrointestinal tract. In these regions of the human body, P. aeruginosa is present in a fluid environment, which will be affected by microgravity and will presumably result in the exposure of P. aeruginosa to lower-fluid-shear conditions than on Earth. This study was the first to characterize the comprehensive transcriptional and translational responses of an opportunistic pathogen that is frequently found in the space habitat. We demonstrated that spaceflight conditions activated pathways in P. aeruginosa that have been shown previously to be involved in the in vivo infection process. However, the regulation of several of these pathways appears to be differentially controlled during spaceflight compared to conventional culture. Hfq was put forward as a main transcriptional regulator in the spaceflight response of P. aeruginosa, therefore representing the first transcriptional regulator commonly involved in the spaceflight responses of different bacterial species. We also identified interesting similarities and differences between P. aeruginosa grown in spaceflight and under the LSMMG conditions of the RWV. Despite the limited overlap of identical genes between spaceflight- and LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa, it was observed that different genes of the same regulon or stimulon could be induced or downregulated in spaceflight and LSMMG. The experimental setup was proposed as one of the putative factors at the origin of the oxygen-related transcriptional differences between LSMMG culture in the RWV bioreactor and spaceflight-cultured P. aeruginosa in the FPAs. These data emphasize the importance of using identical hardware for spaceflight experiments and ground simulations, especially when oxygen is a limiting factor. In addition, differences in fluid shear and other environmental conditions (such as irradiation) between actual microgravity and LSMMG need to be considered when comparing bacterial responses to the two test conditions. This study represents an important step in understanding the response of bacterial opportunistic pathogens to the unique spaceflight environment. Furthermore, it allows assessment of the role that low-fluid-shear regions found in the human body play in the regulation of bacterial virulence. It remains to be determined whether the phenotype of P. aeruginosa acquired under spaceflight conditions will effectively lead to increased pathogenicity, as was observed for S. Typhimurium. This will be an important consideration and key area of future study in order to further assess the risk for infectious disease during long-term missions.Acknowledgments We thank all supporting team members at Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, Ames Research Center, Marshall Spaceflight Center, and BioServe Space Technologies, the crew of STS-115, Neal Pellis, Roy Curtiss III, and Joseph Caspermeyer.

    "abstract": "Abstract Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Escherichia coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases [1], [2]. One of the important aspects of the fitness of E. coli is thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including varied anatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions. Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds, resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden [3], [4]. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans include urinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) and septicemia [4]. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections, mainly respiratory, often leading to death [4]. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin [4] emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derived E. coli strains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks [5], [6], which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir for E. coli causing ExPEC infections in humans. ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross-protective vaccines [7]. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated with certain clinical syndromes. For example, E. coli from a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75% of urinary tract infections [8] and a limited number of serotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly implicated in avian colibacillosis [9], suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties [10], [11]. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanisms of their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology of bacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanisms of fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changing conditions would not only improve our understanding of their persistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments. Previously, the model APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3, previously named pAPEC-1, pAPEC-2, and pAPEC-3 respectively, and a cryptic plasmid pChi7122-4 (Table 1), has been used to undestand the role of large plasmids in the virulence of ExPEC [12]. Specifically, we determined that both the nature of plasmids and their combinations have an effect on the virulence and the genetic diversity of ExPEC. Although we have clearly determined that pChi7122-1 has a major role in systemic infection of APEC in chickens, the role of the remaining plasmids remained unclear. Table 1.

Since pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 do not encode for common ExPEC virulence factors [12], and their roles are considered as minor in systemic infection in chickens [12], we hypothesized that these plasmids could be important in persistence of this bacterial strain in different stressful conditions encountered before and during infections. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain χ7122; and (2) evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well the plasmid pChi7122-1, either individually or in combination, in the bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Moreover, since the plasmids can be carried by strains with different backgrounds, we aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated phenotypes. This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of APEC strain χ7122 and provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Most of the bacterial strains used in this study, listed in Table 1, are derived from the highly virulent APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) [79] and were fully described in our previous studies [10], [12], [80]. To evaluate the effect of the host strain background on plasmid-associated phenotypes, we used three derivatives of χ7122 with different LPS profiles containing the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; a rough mutant strain (O78-) of APEC χ7122, χ7145; and two derivatives of χ7145, χ7167 and χ7193, which respectively express O111 and O1 antigens rather than the native O78 antigen. We also used strains derived from an E. coli K-12, χ6092, containing either pChi7122-1, χ7346; pChi7122-2, χ7347; or pChi7122-3, χ7348 (Table 1, [10], [12], [80]). Antibiotic susceptibility testing of strains was performed and interpreted via disk diffusion method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [81], [82]. A collection of one hundred human strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) [19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were used to study the distribution of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3-associated genes among different groups of pathogenic E. coli by PCR. Unless otherwise stated, bacteria were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% lactose at 37°C. Strains were stored as stock cultures at −80°C in peptone-glycerol medium. All wild-type derivative strains grew similarly in LB and reached the OD600 ∼1.0 when incubated overnight (O/N) at 37°C standing, except the strain χ7561 (pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2) which had a slightly lower growth and its OD600 was around 0.8 when grown in the same conditions. Plasmid sequencing and annotation The DNA sequences of pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3 and pChi7122-4 plasmids were derived from contig sequences of the whole genomic DNA of APEC χ7122. The sequences were manipulated to the standard of an ‘Improved High-Quality Draft’ [83]. The program Artemis [84] was used to identify the plasmids and collate data. For each of the three plasmids all the sequence gaps were closed by directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products sequenced with big dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. All the plasmids were circularized and contiguated using this method. The DNA sequences were annotated to identify coding sequences and repeat sequences in Artemis and the vector NTI suite of programs was used to confirm the previous analysis. To identify plasmids with similar sequences, pChi7122-2 (FR851303) and pChi7122-3 (FR851304) were compared by BLASTn at . Plasmid sequences of pEG356 (FN594520.1) from Shigella sonnei, pHK01 (HM355591.1) from a urinary E. coli isolate, pAA (FN554767.1) from EAEC, and pKF3-70 (FJ494913.1) from K. pneumoniae, and R721 (AP002527.1) a trimethoprim and streptomycin resistant plasmid from an E. coli were downloaded. Plasmid sequences were aligned and then visualized using ACT and Mauve v2.3.1 [85]. Schematic plasmid drawings were constructed using DNAplotter [86]. Amino acid sequence and protein structural-based alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench software tool (v. 6.1 CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark) and the web-based interface for ESPript v.2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi) [87], respectively. The 3-D structure of the proteins pChiA, pChiT, pChiO, pChiD, and pChiR were predicted using position specific iterative (PSI)- BLAST alignment and HHpred [38]. Prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) genes among avian and human pathogenic E. coli One hundred human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) [19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were screened by PCR [19] for the presence of the eitA, pilS, and pilV genes using the primers eitA F: 5′-AACTGCGGCTATCAGGAGAC-3′ and eitA R : 5′-CAGGTCATATCCCACAGCTT-3′; pilS F: 5′-CTTCTCTTTCTGCACACCGT-3′ and pilS R: 5′-TGTGATTGTAACGGAGCC-3′; pilV F: 5′-TCTATACAGGCGAGTATTTA-3′ and pilV R: 5′-AATTCATACCAGAATACTCA-3′. The primers were designed from the sequence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV). Growth comparison assays The growth rates of strains were compared in iron-sequestered medium using LB containing 100 µM of α,α′-dipyridyl alone or supplemented with either Heme (Sigma, 600 µg ml−1), hemoglobin (Sigma, 60 µg ml−1), or FeSO4 (Sigma, 20 mM: control). The growth rates were also tested in minimal medium MM9 [12], MM9 with thiamin (1 µg ml−1) and 0.1% casamino acid, and supplemented with glucose, lactose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, glucuronic acid, or glucoronic acid (0.2%) as source of carbon at 37°C shaking (180 rpm). The OD600 was recorded every hour over 24-hour period. Interaction of strains with 3-D INT-407 human epithelial cells 3-D cultures of human INT-407 cells (ATCC CCL6) were used as model intestinal epithelium and were prepared as previously described [54]. Approximately 106 CFU of PBS-washed bacteria, grown rotating to an OD600 1.0 in LB, were added to each well (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10). For bacterial association assays, the 24-well plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour, and rinsed three times with PBS. PBS-0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid sodium salt was added to each well, and samples were diluted and spread on MacConkey medium plates for enumeration by viable colony counting. For invasion assays, extracellular bacteria were killed following the initial 1-h incubation period by an additional 1-h incubation in medium containing gentamicin (100 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then washed 3× with PBS and lysed. Bacterial titers in the lysates were determined by serial dilutions and plating on MacConkey agar. The results were expressed as the Log10CFU/ml. Antibodies specific for O78-LPS (Denken Seiken) and the human tight junction protein ZO-1 (Invitrogen) were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging. Antibodies were of porcine and mouse origins, respectively, and were used at a dilution of 1∶500 (anti-O78-LPS) and 1∶100 (anti-ZO-1). Goat anti-porcine and anti-mouse secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies anti-O78-LPS and anti-ZO-1 respectively and were diluted 1∶500 in blocking solution (8% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton-X100 in DPBS). Cell nuclei and the F-actin cytoskeleton were visualized with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) and phalloidin (Invitrogen), respectively. The fixation and staining of 3-D aggregates was performed as described previously [88]. Optical sections of the 3-D aggregates were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for monitoring emissions of the selected fluorophores. Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil DIC objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package. Axiovision 4.8 software from Carl Zeiss was used to further process collected images. Sensitivity of strains to deoxycholate (DOC) and acid shock tolerance To determine the ability of bacteria to survive at sub-lethal bile concentration, different strains were grown rotating to an OD600 1.0 in LB medium. Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB agar and LB agar containing 1% (w/v) DOC plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. For acid shock assays, bacterial cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth, pH 7, O/N standing. Cultures adjusted to the same OD600 of 1.0 were diluted 1∶1,000 in LB, pH 2.5, and incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Samples were cultured by direct plating on LB agar after 8 h and 18 h to determine the percent survival following acid stress. As controls, bacteria were also grown in LB, pH 7 in the same conditions to determine if the growth of bacteria was affected. Biofilm formation assay Biofilm formation assays were performed in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) [89]. In brief, strains were grown to stationary phase in LB at 37°C and then diluted 1∶100 in LB supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) L-glucose. Aliquots of 200 µL for each dilution were dispensed per well into a microtiter plate (four wells/strain). Each strain was tested in quadruplicate, wells containing sterile medium were used as negative controls. Plates were sealed with parafilm and cultured standing either at 30°C, 37°C or 42°C for 5 days to mimic the environmental and body temperature of humans and chickens, respectively. The media of the plates were then decanted, and the plates were washed twice with sterile PBS. Microplates were then stained with 200 µL of 1% (w/v) Crystal Violet for 30 min, followed by washing twice with PBS to remove unbound dye. After drying, dye-containing adherent cells were resolubilized with 200 µL of 30% (v/v) acetic acid solution. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm in an ELISA reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). All tests were carried out at least three times, and the results were averaged. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test (GraphPad Prism software, version 5.07). Differences between average values were also tested for significance by performing an unpaired, two-sided Student t test.

So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids [20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups [21], studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC χ7122 in pathogenesis in chickens [12] and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122-1 [19]. We were able to assign roles for pChi7122-1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 in APEC χ7122 were equivocal. General sequence features of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 In this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122-2 (FR851303), pChi7122-3 (FR851304) and pChi7122-4 (FR851305). The general sequence features of the three plasmids are listed in the Table 2. Table 2. Summary of general characteristics of the three sequenced plasmids of APEC χ7122.

Analysis of pChi7122-4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predicted to encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only (Table 2, Fig. 1); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis. Figure 1. Circular representation of pChi7122-2 (A), pChi7122-3 (B), and pChi7122-4 (C). Open in a new tab The different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G−C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence-associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein.We assessed the presence of eitA gene of pChi7122-2 and two genes of pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) by PCR among 225 pathogenic E. coli strains from different origins, including 100 human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 human enteric pathogenic E. coli. PCR results show that eitA was present in 10% of non-UTI human isolates and 5% of APEC strains, but was absent in other groups. The genes pilS and pilV of pChi7122-3 were detected in 8.75% of the APEC group and in 10% of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicate the recent acquisition of these genes by these E. coli strains, enabling them to inhabit new niches. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 are self-conjugative [12]. Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1, Table S1 and S2). The transfer region of pChi7122-2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24 tra and 9 trb genes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA (FN554767.1; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas the tra region of pChi7122-3 has the same organization as its equivalent in E. coli conjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11 tra/trb genes, grouped in two clusters separated by two pil genes (Fig. 1, Table S2). pChi7122-3 also harbors genes nikB, nikC, and nikA for relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer [22], [23] (Fig. 1, Table S2). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122-2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2-101, MM2-102 and MM2-103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase (sul1) [24], a GCN5-related N-acetyl transferase [25] and a streptomycin 3′-adenylytransferase (SP-R) (aadA) [26], respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122-2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants [27]. It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine [28]. Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122-2 shares high homology with plasmids from Shigella sonnei (pEG356), an urinary E. coli isolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), and K. pneumoniae (pKF3-70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122-3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, the E. coli plasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriae pil operon [29], [30] and shufflon [31], [32]. Mauve alignment of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies (Fig. S1). The plasmid pChi7122-2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locus eitABCD (Fig. 2A), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC-O2-ColV [17] and pAPEC-O1-ColBM [15]. A DNA comparison of the regions of eitABCD of the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC-O2-ColV, this region is located downstream of the par region of plasmids and is flanked by the transposon tnpA gene in pChi7122-2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequence IS629 in pAPEC-O1-ColBM (Fig. 2A) which could explain the dissemination of eitABCD among genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron-uptake phenotype expression of eitABCD genes using CAS agar medium [12], even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122-1 and chromosomally-encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth of strains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron-limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO4, heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122-1 increased the growth of strains in iron-sequestered environments (Fig. S2). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related to the autotransporter Tsh encoded by pChi7122-1 [33], which has previously been reported to bind to red blood cells [34]. Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression of eitABCD, such as under in vivo conditions. Figure 2. Comparison of physical and genetic maps for eitABCD and sugar pathway regions. Open in a new tab The eitABCD region from pChi7122-2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 (HM355591.1), pEG356 (FN594520.1), pAPEC-O2-ColV (NC_007675.1), pAA (FN554767.1), and pAPEC-O1-ColBM (NC_009837.1) (A); and sugars pathways genome region pChiA pChiOTDR in pChi7122-2 to its equivalent found in the genomes of S. Enteritidis (AM933172.1), S. Gallinarum (AM933173.1), S. Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and S. Agona (CP001138.1) respectively (B). New putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122-2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle [35]. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways [36], [37]. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122-2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation-sensing protein (pChiA) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genes pChiOTDR (Fig. 2B, 3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of other E. coli available on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes of Salmonella Enteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in these Salmonella serovars has determined that, with the exception of S. Agona, in which the pChiA-equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of the pChiOTDR homologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86%–99% (Fig. 2B, Table S3, and Fig. S3). Figure 3. Plasmid pChi7122-2 putative sugar utilization pathway. Open in a new tab Illustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operon pChiOTDR (A), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operon pChiA pChiOTDR (B). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator of pChiOTDR genes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements for pChiOTDR (Ppchi) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements for pChiA (PpChiA) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining.The putative functions and the predicted 3-D structures of the pChiA and pChiOTDR gene products, determined by Blast-PSI and HHpred [38], show that pChiA encodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D-mannonate and D-altronate as substrates [39] and pChiOTDR encode for a gluconate 5-dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR-like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3, Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, PpChiA and PpChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes [40], [41], were detected in the promoter region of pChiA and pChiO (Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family [42]. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source for E. coli, the CRP would activate the pChi7122-2 sugars pathways [40], [41]; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensal E. coli and EHEC [36]. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose [43] and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up-regulated in S. Typhimurium in macrophages [44], suggesting that the new pChi7122-2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. Compared to the chromosomal E. coli K-12 L-idonic acid pathway encoded by the gnTII genes, idnK idnDOTR [45], the genes of the operon pChiOTDR of pChi7122-2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level (Table 3); moreover, the position of the gene of L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene, idnK, of GnTII pathway [45] is absent in the pChi7122-2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein, rspA-like [46] pChiA which is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122-2 (pChiR) (Table 3). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested (Fig. S4), there were no significant differences between strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122-2. The functionality of the sugar utilization pathway genes located on pChi7122-2 would be more apparent in gntII-operon-deleted strains [45], or by evaluation of their expression under in vivo conditions, such as using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) method [47]. Future studies will be conducted to determine the conditions of their expression and their eventual role in both APEC and Salmonella serovars. Table 3.

Diversity of plasmids-associated fitness phenotypes and the effect of host strain background on their expression The genomic diversity among ExPEC isolates has been described and multiple factors have been linked to their virulence [48], [49]. However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypic diversity has not been done previously. In this study, the large plasmids-associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans [50] and chickens [5]. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host [51]. APEC strain χ7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) [52], and could cause human diseases [53]. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC-derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans [50]. Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food-borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products [4], [6], [28], we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC-derivative strains with 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3-D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function [54]. The highly differentiated character of the 3-D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo [55]. Our data showed that APEC-derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC-derivative strains for their interaction with 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis-causing bacteria, including E. coli K1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [56]. These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host. Figure 4.

In this study, we have shown that all wild-type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown); whereas the group of strains derived from E. coli K-12 behaved differently (Fig. 5A). Although, E. coli K-12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains χ7346 (pChi7122-1) and χ7347 (pChi7122-2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1% (w/v) DOC as compared to their parent χ6092. The strain χ7348 (pChi7122-3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain χ6092 (Fig. 5A). According to our results APEC χ7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media then E. coli K-12 which was sensitive to the detergent (Fig. 5, data of wild-type not shown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPS and plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid-associated resistance in E. coli K-12 background but not in the wild-type background strains, could be related to the presence of other factors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked the effect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supported by the resistance of the rough mutant which is usually hypersensitive to bile [57]. The mechanism of resistance encoded by the plasmid pChi7122-1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance in Vibrio cholerae [58] and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxic compounds [59]. Since such factors are not located on pChi7122-2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such as TA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology [60], [61], [62]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistance of E. coli. Figure 5. Bile and acid tolerance of strains.

Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB and LB +1% (w/v) DOC agar plates. The approximate numbers of bacteria present in each dilution are indicated on the right side of the plate (A). Percent acid survival of wild-type derivative strains in acid shock for 18 hours (B). Abbreviations used are: pChi7122-1,2,3 = pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-1,2 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2; pChi7122-1,3 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-2-3 = pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3.Acid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH [63]. Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild-type derived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period (12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly (data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours), strains behaved differently (Fig. 5B). Similar to the study by Lim et al. [64] on the plasmid pO157 in E. coli O157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubated for 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmid pChi7122-1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122-2 or pChi7122-3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presence of pChi7122-3 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Since pChi7122-1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC [12] and E. coli O157 [64] respectively, these findings could indicate that the presence of plasmids exert a cost to bacterial fitness when exposed for a long period (>18 hours) to acidic conditions, whereas bacteria containing other plasmids such as pChi7122-3 in χ7122 would have better survivability in these conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122-3 is needed to fully understanding the persistence of E. coli in acidic conditions. Our study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78-antigen LPS for the acid tolerance of E. coli [65], and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response (Fig. 5B).Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically-important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65-80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm-related [66]. However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. ExPEC cells are found in biofilm-like communities in both gastrointestinal [67] and urinary tracts [68] indicating the importance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPEC bacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In this study, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually or in combination in both an APEC wild-type and an E. coli K-12 background, and different O-LPS at different temperatures, has revealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether, our data distinguished four groups of factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, O-LPS-, and rough LPS-mediated biofilms in E. coli which differ in their expression conditions. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30°C than at 37°C or 42°C (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild-type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37° and 42°) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild-type strain, with the data being statistically significant (P<0.05) at 42°C (Fig. 6A). Figure 6. Effect of plasmids, O-LPS, and temperature on biofilm formation. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: χ7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No-plasmids (χ7368), pChi7122-1 (χ7394), pChi7122-2 (χ7392), pChi7122-3 (χ7367), pChi7122-1,2 (χ7561), pChi7122-1-3 (χ7562), and pChi7122-2,3 (χ7274) (A), E. coli K-12 (χ6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122-1 (χ7346), pChi7122-2 (χ7347), and pChi7122-3 (χ7348) (B), and χ7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78(-) (χ7145), smooth strains with either O1-LPS (O1) (χ7193) or O111-LPS (O111) (χ7167) (C) at either 30°C, 37°C, or 42°C.The biofilm formed by the plasmid-cured strain, highly produced at 30°C (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no-plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30°C and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion [69]. Expression of biofilm in the environment (30°C) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements. It has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F-pili mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation [70], [71], [72]. In this report, we have shown that plasmid-driven biofilms are very complex and this complexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, their combinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature to which the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A) and pChi7122-3 in the E. coli K-12 strain (Fig. 6B), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, with data being significant at 42°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6B). The fact that pChi7122-3-driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higher than those of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-1 in both wild-type and the E. coli K-12 backgrounds could be related to not only the tra genes expression [70], [71], [72] but also to the type IV fimbriae encoded by pChi7122-3, which was previously associated with the biofilm formation in enteroaggregative E. coli [73]. Plasmid-driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by giving bacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, which could result in disease. A controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation [74], [75]. In this study, we have shown that the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in wild-type derivative strains with different O-LPS backgrounds behaved differently in their biofilm formation (Fig. 6C). In absence of O78-LPS, the rough strain produced significantly (P<0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild-type strain at 30°C. Even though substitution of O78-LPS with O111-LPS had little effect on biofilm formation, the substitution of O78-LPS with O1-LPS has in contrary greatly enhanced biofilm formation in these bacteria at 30°C. Since the O1-LPS-driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30°C condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37°C/42°C), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that the temperature of 30°C in early O1-LPS-associated biofilm formation is necessary. The fact that O1-LPS-driven biofilm is not highly formed at 37°C and 42°C (Fig. 6C), could be related to a change in the LPS-O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature [76], [77], [78] leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the nature of LPS on biofilm formation. Conclusion A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae pil operon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multiple plasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC χ7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four different factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-, and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.",
    "discussion": "Results and Discussion Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids [20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups [21], studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC χ7122 in pathogenesis in chickens [12] and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122-1 [19]. We were able to assign roles for pChi7122-1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 in APEC χ7122 were equivocal. General sequence features of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 In this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122-2 (FR851303), pChi7122-3 (FR851304) and pChi7122-4 (FR851305). The general sequence features of the three plasmids are listed in the Table 2. Table 2. Summary of general characteristics of the three sequenced plasmids of APEC χ7122.

Analysis of pChi7122-4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predicted to encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only (Table 2, Fig. 1); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis. Figure 1. Circular representation of pChi7122-2 (A), pChi7122-3 (B), and pChi7122-4 (C). Open in a new tab The different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G−C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence-associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein.We assessed the presence of eitA gene of pChi7122-2 and two genes of pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) by PCR among 225 pathogenic E. coli strains from different origins, including 100 human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 human enteric pathogenic E. coli. PCR results show that eitA was present in 10% of non-UTI human isolates and 5% of APEC strains, but was absent in other groups. The genes pilS and pilV of pChi7122-3 were detected in 8.75% of the APEC group and in 10% of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicate the recent acquisition of these genes by these E. coli strains, enabling them to inhabit new niches. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 are self-conjugative [12]. Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1, Table S1 and S2). The transfer region of pChi7122-2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24 tra and 9 trb genes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA (FN554767.1; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas the tra region of pChi7122-3 has the same organization as its equivalent in E. coli conjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11 tra/trb genes, grouped in two clusters separated by two pil genes (Fig. 1, Table S2). pChi7122-3 also harbors genes nikB, nikC, and nikA for relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer [22], [23] (Fig. 1, Table S2). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122-2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2-101, MM2-102 and MM2-103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase (sul1) [24], a GCN5-related N-acetyl transferase [25] and a streptomycin 3′-adenylytransferase (SP-R) (aadA) [26], respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122-2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants [27]. It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine [28]. Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122-2 shares high homology with plasmids from Shigella sonnei (pEG356), an urinary E. coli isolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), and K. pneumoniae (pKF3-70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122-3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, the E. coli plasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriae pil operon [29], [30] and shufflon [31], [32]. Mauve alignment of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies (Fig. S1). The plasmid pChi7122-2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locus eitABCD (Fig. 2A), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC-O2-ColV [17] and pAPEC-O1-ColBM [15]. A DNA comparison of the regions of eitABCD of the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC-O2-ColV, this region is located downstream of the par region of plasmids and is flanked by the transposon tnpA gene in pChi7122-2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequence IS629 in pAPEC-O1-ColBM (Fig. 2A) which could explain the dissemination of eitABCD among genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron-uptake phenotype expression of eitABCD genes using CAS agar medium [12], even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122-1 and chromosomally-encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth of strains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron-limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO4, heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122-1 increased the growth of strains in iron-sequestered environments (Fig. S2). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related to the autotransporter Tsh encoded by pChi7122-1 [33], which has previously been reported to bind to red blood cells [34]. Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression of eitABCD, such as under in vivo conditions. Figure 2. Comparison of physical and genetic maps for eitABCD and sugar pathway regions. Open in a new tab The eitABCD region from pChi7122-2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 (HM355591.1), pEG356 (FN594520.1), pAPEC-O2-ColV (NC_007675.1), pAA (FN554767.1), and pAPEC-O1-ColBM (NC_009837.1) (A); and sugars pathways genome region pChiA pChiOTDR in pChi7122-2 to its equivalent found in the genomes of S. Enteritidis (AM933172.1), S. Gallinarum (AM933173.1), S. Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and S. Agona (CP001138.1) respectively (B). New putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122-2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle [35]. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways [36], [37]. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122-2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation-sensing protein (pChiA) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genes pChiOTDR (Fig. 2B, 3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of other E. coli available on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes of Salmonella Enteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in these Salmonella serovars has determined that, with the exception of S. Agona, in which the pChiA-equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of the pChiOTDR homologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86%–99% (Fig. 2B, Table S3, and Fig. S3). Figure 3. Plasmid pChi7122-2 putative sugar utilization pathway. Open in a new tab Illustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operon pChiOTDR (A), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operon pChiA pChiOTDR (B). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator of pChiOTDR genes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements for pChiOTDR (Ppchi) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements for pChiA (PpChiA) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining.The putative functions and the predicted 3-D structures of the pChiA and pChiOTDR gene products, determined by Blast-PSI and HHpred [38], show that pChiA encodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D-mannonate and D-altronate as substrates [39] and pChiOTDR encode for a gluconate 5-dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR-like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3, Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, PpChiA and PpChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes [40], [41], were detected in the promoter region of pChiA and pChiO (Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family [42]. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source for E. coli, the CRP would activate the pChi7122-2 sugars pathways [40], [41]; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensal E. coli and EHEC [36]. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose [43] and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up-regulated in S. Typhimurium in macrophages [44], suggesting that the new pChi7122-2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. Compared to the chromosomal E. coli K-12 L-idonic acid pathway encoded by the gnTII genes, idnK idnDOTR [45], the genes of the operon pChiOTDR of pChi7122-2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level (Table 3); moreover, the position of the gene of L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene, idnK, of GnTII pathway [45] is absent in the pChi7122-2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein, rspA-like [46] pChiA which is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122-2 (pChiR) (Table 3). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested (Fig. S4), there were no significant differences between strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122-2. The functionality of the sugar utilization pathway genes located on pChi7122-2 would be more apparent in gntII-operon-deleted strains [45], or by evaluation of their expression under in vivo conditions, such as using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) method [47]. Future studies will be conducted to determine the conditions of their expression and their eventual role in both APEC and Salmonella serovars. Table 3.

Diversity of plasmids-associated fitness phenotypes and the effect of host strain background on their expression The genomic diversity among ExPEC isolates has been described and multiple factors have been linked to their virulence [48], [49]. However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypic diversity has not been done previously. In this study, the large plasmids-associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans [50] and chickens [5]. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host [51]. APEC strain χ7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) [52], and could cause human diseases [53]. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC-derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans [50]. Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food-borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products [4], [6], [28], we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC-derivative strains with 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3-D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function [54]. The highly differentiated character of the 3-D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo [55]. Our data showed that APEC-derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC-derivative strains for their interaction with 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis-causing bacteria, including E. coli K1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [56]. These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host. Figure 4.

In this study, we have shown that all wild-type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown); whereas the group of strains derived from E. coli K-12 behaved differently (Fig. 5A). Although, E. coli K-12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains χ7346 (pChi7122-1) and χ7347 (pChi7122-2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1% (w/v) DOC as compared to their parent χ6092. The strain χ7348 (pChi7122-3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain χ6092 (Fig. 5A). According to our results APEC χ7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media then E. coli K-12 which was sensitive to the detergent (Fig. 5, data of wild-type not shown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPS and plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid-associated resistance in E. coli K-12 background but not in the wild-type background strains, could be related to the presence of other factors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked the effect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supported by the resistance of the rough mutant which is usually hypersensitive to bile [57]. The mechanism of resistance encoded by the plasmid pChi7122-1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance in Vibrio cholerae [58] and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxic compounds [59]. Since such factors are not located on pChi7122-2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such as TA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology [60], [61], [62]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistance of E. coli. Figure 5. Bile and acid tolerance of strains.

Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB and LB +1% (w/v) DOC agar plates. The approximate numbers of bacteria present in each dilution are indicated on the right side of the plate (A). Percent acid survival of wild-type derivative strains in acid shock for 18 hours (B). Abbreviations used are: pChi7122-1,2,3 = pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-1,2 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2; pChi7122-1,3 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-2-3 = pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3.Acid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH [63]. Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild-type derived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period (12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly (data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours), strains behaved differently (Fig. 5B). Similar to the study by Lim et al. [64] on the plasmid pO157 in E. coli O157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubated for 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmid pChi7122-1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122-2 or pChi7122-3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presence of pChi7122-3 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Since pChi7122-1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC [12] and E. coli O157 [64] respectively, these findings could indicate that the presence of plasmids exert a cost to bacterial fitness when exposed for a long period (>18 hours) to acidic conditions, whereas bacteria containing other plasmids such as pChi7122-3 in χ7122 would have better survivability in these conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122-3 is needed to fully understanding the persistence of E. coli in acidic conditions. Our study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78-antigen LPS for the acid tolerance of E. coli [65], and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response (Fig. 5B).Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically-important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65-80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm-related [66]. However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. ExPEC cells are found in biofilm-like communities in both gastrointestinal [67] and urinary tracts [68] indicating the importance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPEC bacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In this study, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually or in combination in both an APEC wild-type and an E. coli K-12 background, and different O-LPS at different temperatures, has revealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether, our data distinguished four groups of factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, O-LPS-, and rough LPS-mediated biofilms in E. coli which differ in their expression conditions. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30°C than at 37°C or 42°C (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild-type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37° and 42°) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild-type strain, with the data being statistically significant (P<0.05) at 42°C (Fig. 6A). Figure 6. Effect of plasmids, O-LPS, and temperature on biofilm formation. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: χ7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No-plasmids (χ7368), pChi7122-1 (χ7394), pChi7122-2 (χ7392), pChi7122-3 (χ7367), pChi7122-1,2 (χ7561), pChi7122-1-3 (χ7562), and pChi7122-2,3 (χ7274) (A), E. coli K-12 (χ6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122-1 (χ7346), pChi7122-2 (χ7347), and pChi7122-3 (χ7348) (B), and χ7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78(-) (χ7145), smooth strains with either O1-LPS (O1) (χ7193) or O111-LPS (O111) (χ7167) (C) at either 30°C, 37°C, or 42°C.The biofilm formed by the plasmid-cured strain, highly produced at 30°C (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no-plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30°C and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion [69]. Expression of biofilm in the environment (30°C) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements. It has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F-pili mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation [70], [71], [72]. In this report, we have shown that plasmid-driven biofilms are very complex and this complexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, their combinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature to which the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A) and pChi7122-3 in the E. coli K-12 strain (Fig. 6B), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, with data being significant at 42°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6B). The fact that pChi7122-3-driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higher than those of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-1 in both wild-type and the E. coli K-12 backgrounds could be related to not only the tra genes expression [70], [71], [72] but also to the type IV fimbriae encoded by pChi7122-3, which was previously associated with the biofilm formation in enteroaggregative E. coli [73]. Plasmid-driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by giving bacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, which could result in disease. A controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation [74], [75]. In this study, we have shown that the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in wild-type derivative strains with different O-LPS backgrounds behaved differently in their biofilm formation (Fig. 6C). In absence of O78-LPS, the rough strain produced significantly (P<0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild-type strain at 30°C. Even though substitution of O78-LPS with O111-LPS had little effect on biofilm formation, the substitution of O78-LPS with O1-LPS has in contrary greatly enhanced biofilm formation in these bacteria at 30°C. Since the O1-LPS-driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30°C condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37°C/42°C), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that the temperature of 30°C in early O1-LPS-associated biofilm formation is necessary. The fact that O1-LPS-driven biofilm is not highly formed at 37°C and 42°C (Fig. 6C), could be related to a change in the LPS-O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature [76], [77], [78] leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the nature of LPS on biofilm formation. Conclusion A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae pil operon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multiple plasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC χ7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four different factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-, and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.",

Copyright notice ID: 3251573 PMID: 22238616 Abstract Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.Introduction Escherichia coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases [1], [2]. One of the important aspects of the fitness of E. coli is thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including varied anatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions. Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds, resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden [3], [4]. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans include urinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) and septicemia [4]. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections, mainly respiratory, often leading to death [4]. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin [4] emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derived E. coli strains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks [5], [6], which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir for E. coli causing ExPEC infections in humans. ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross-protective vaccines [7]. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated with certain clinical syndromes. For example, E. coli from a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75% of urinary tract infections [8] and a limited number of serotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly implicated in avian colibacillosis [9], suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties [10], [11]. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanisms of their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology of bacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanisms of fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changing conditions would not only improve our understanding of their persistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments. Previously, the model APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3, previously named pAPEC-1, pAPEC-2, and pAPEC-3 respectively, and a cryptic plasmid pChi7122-4 (Table 1), has been used to undestand the role of large plasmids in the virulence of ExPEC [12]. Specifically, we determined that both the nature of plasmids and their combinations have an effect on the virulence and the genetic diversity of ExPEC. Although we have clearly determined that pChi7122-1 has a major role in systemic infection of APEC in chickens, the role of the remaining plasmids remained unclear. Table 1.

Therefore, this study aimed to (1) fully sequence and analyze the DNA of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 of APEC strain χ7122; and (2) evaluate the contribution of these plasmids, as well the plasmid pChi7122-1, either individually or in combination, in the bacterial interaction with a model human intestinal epithelial cell line, bile and acid resistance, biofilm formation, and growth in iron-restricted medium and in the presence of different carbon sources. Moreover, since the plasmids can be carried by strains with different backgrounds, we aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid-associated phenotypes. This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of APEC strain χ7122 and provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that ExPEC may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions.Results and Discussion Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids [20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups [21], studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC χ7122 in pathogenesis in chickens [12] and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122-1 [19]. We were able to assign roles for pChi7122-1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 in APEC χ7122 were equivocal. General sequence features of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 In this study, we present the whole DNA sequences of plasmids pChi7122-2 (FR851303), pChi7122-3 (FR851304) and pChi7122-4 (FR851305). The general sequence features of the three plasmids are listed in the Table 2. Table 2. Summary of general characteristics of the three sequenced plasmids of APEC χ7122.

Analysis of pChi7122-4 revealed 3 CDSs that were predicted to encode plasmid replication and maintenance functions only (Table 2, Fig. 1); consequently we excluded this plasmid from all further experimental analysis. Figure 1. Circular representation of pChi7122-2 (A), pChi7122-3 (B), and pChi7122-4 (C). Open in a new tab The different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G−C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence-associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein.We assessed the presence of eitA gene of pChi7122-2 and two genes of pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) by PCR among 225 pathogenic E. coli strains from different origins, including 100 human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI), 80 APEC, and 45 human enteric pathogenic E. coli. PCR results show that eitA was present in 10% of non-UTI human isolates and 5% of APEC strains, but was absent in other groups. The genes pilS and pilV of pChi7122-3 were detected in 8.75% of the APEC group and in 10% of human UTI isolates, respectively. The low prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) genes among other ExPEC of human and avian origin, as determined by PCR, could indicate the recent acquisition of these genes by these E. coli strains, enabling them to inhabit new niches. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 are self-conjugative [12]. Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1, Table S1 and S2). The transfer region of pChi7122-2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24 tra and 9 trb genes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA (FN554767.1; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas the tra region of pChi7122-3 has the same organization as its equivalent in E. coli conjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11 tra/trb genes, grouped in two clusters separated by two pil genes (Fig. 1, Table S2). pChi7122-3 also harbors genes nikB, nikC, and nikA for relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer [22], [23] (Fig. 1, Table S2). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122-2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2-101, MM2-102 and MM2-103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase (sul1) [24], a GCN5-related N-acetyl transferase [25] and a streptomycin 3′-adenylytransferase (SP-R) (aadA) [26], respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122-2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants [27]. It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine [28]. Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122-2 shares high homology with plasmids from Shigella sonnei (pEG356), an urinary E. coli isolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), and K. pneumoniae (pKF3-70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122-3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, the E. coli plasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriae pil operon [29], [30] and shufflon [31], [32]. Mauve alignment of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies (Fig. S1). The plasmid pChi7122-2 and its homologous plasmids have a 4 kb region in common, which encodes for the ABC iron uptake locus eitABCD (Fig. 2A), previously described in two other APEC plasmids, pAPEC-O2-ColV [17] and pAPEC-O1-ColBM [15]. A DNA comparison of the regions of eitABCD of the six plasmids has shown that with the exception of pAPEC-O2-ColV, this region is located downstream of the par region of plasmids and is flanked by the transposon tnpA gene in pChi7122-2, pHK01, and pEG356 respectively and by an insertion sequence IS629 in pAPEC-O1-ColBM (Fig. 2A) which could explain the dissemination of eitABCD among genomes of these bacteria. We were unable to detect the iron-uptake phenotype expression of eitABCD genes using CAS agar medium [12], even though it was efficient in revealing those of pChi7122-1 and chromosomally-encoded systems. Therefore in this study, we extended the analysis by testing the growth of strains, with and without the three plasmids, in iron-limited medium alone or supplemented with either FeSO4, heme or hemoglobin. Our results show that only pChi7122-1 increased the growth of strains in iron-sequestered environments (Fig. S2). The ability to acquire iron from heme and hemoglobin could be related to the autotransporter Tsh encoded by pChi7122-1 [33], which has previously been reported to bind to red blood cells [34]. Future studies are needed to determine conditions of expression of eitABCD, such as under in vivo conditions. Figure 2. Comparison of physical and genetic maps for eitABCD and sugar pathway regions. Open in a new tab The eitABCD region from pChi7122-2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 (HM355591.1), pEG356 (FN594520.1), pAPEC-O2-ColV (NC_007675.1), pAA (FN554767.1), and pAPEC-O1-ColBM (NC_009837.1) (A); and sugars pathways genome region pChiA pChiOTDR in pChi7122-2 to its equivalent found in the genomes of S. Enteritidis (AM933172.1), S. Gallinarum (AM933173.1), S. Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and S. Agona (CP001138.1) respectively (B).New putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122-2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle [35]. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways [36], [37]. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122-2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation-sensing protein (pChiA) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genes pChiOTDR (Fig. 2B, 3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of other E. coli available on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes of Salmonella Enteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in these Salmonella serovars has determined that, with the exception of S. Agona, in which the pChiA-equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of the pChiOTDR homologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86%–99% (Fig. 2B, Table S3, and Fig. S3). Figure 3. Plasmid pChi7122-2 putative sugar utilization pathway. Open in a new tab Illustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operon pChiOTDR (A), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operon pChiA pChiOTDR (B). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator of pChiOTDR genes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements for pChiOTDR (Ppchi) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements for pChiA (PpChiA) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining.The putative functions and the predicted 3-D structures of the pChiA and pChiOTDR gene products, determined by Blast-PSI and HHpred [38], show that pChiA encodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D-mannonate and D-altronate as substrates [39] and pChiOTDR encode for a gluconate 5-dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR-like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3, Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, PpChiA and PpChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes [40], [41], were detected in the promoter region of pChiA and pChiO (Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family [42]. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source for E. coli, the CRP would activate the pChi7122-2 sugars pathways [40], [41]; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensal E. coli and EHEC [36]. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose [43] and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up-regulated in S. Typhimurium in macrophages [44], suggesting that the new pChi7122-2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as in Salmonella serovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. Compared to the chromosomal E. coli K-12 L-idonic acid pathway encoded by the gnTII genes, idnK idnDOTR [45], the genes of the operon pChiOTDR of pChi7122-2 have no significant homologies at the DNA level and share some sequence identity at the protein level (Table 3); moreover, the position of the gene of L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase is different in the two distinct gene clusters. Intriguingly, the gluconate kinase gene, idnK, of GnTII pathway [45] is absent in the pChi7122-2 pathway and is substituted by the gene of the starvation sensing protein, rspA-like [46] pChiA which is essential for survival of bacteria in limited nutrient conditions. The gene encoding the regulatory protein GntR in the GnTII pathways, exhibits no significant homology at both DNA and protein levels with its counterpart in pChi7122-2 (pChiR) (Table 3). In this study, although we have shown that strains have better growth in media with glucoronic acid than with other sugars tested (Fig. S4), there were no significant differences between strains with and without the plasmid pChi7122-2. The functionality of the sugar utilization pathway genes located on pChi7122-2 would be more apparent in gntII-operon-deleted strains [45], or by evaluation of their expression under in vivo conditions, such as using the selective capture of transcribed sequences (SCOTS) method [47]. Future studies will be conducted to determine the conditions of their expression and their eventual role in both APEC and Salmonella serovars. Table 3.

However, a systematic analysis of ExPEC phenotypic diversity has not been done previously. In this study, the large plasmids-associated phenotypes related to fitness of ExPEC bacteria as well the effect of host strain backgrounds were investigated. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans [50] and chickens [5]. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host [51]. APEC strain χ7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) [52], and could cause human diseases [53]. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC-derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans [50]. Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food-borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products [4], [6], [28], we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC-derivative strains with 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3-D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function [54]. The highly differentiated character of the 3-D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo [55]. Our data showed that APEC-derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC-derivative strains for their interaction with 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis-causing bacteria, including E. coli K1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) [56]. These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host. Figure 4.

In this study, we have shown that all wild-type derived strains tested were resistant to deoxycholate (DOC), one of the most abundant bile salts in humans (data not shown); whereas the group of strains derived from E. coli K-12 behaved differently (Fig. 5A). Although, E. coli K-12 was sensitive to the bile, its plasmid derivative strains χ7346 (pChi7122-1) and χ7347 (pChi7122-2) had increased survival in LB agar media with 1% (w/v) DOC as compared to their parent χ6092. The strain χ7348 (pChi7122-3) was as sensitive to bile as its parent strain χ6092 (Fig. 5A). According to our results APEC χ7122 strain better tolerates the presence of bile salts in the media then E. coli K-12 which was sensitive to the detergent (Fig. 5, data of wild-type not shown). The mechanism of resistance of APEC could be both LPS and plasmid related. In fact, the detection of plasmid-associated resistance in E. coli K-12 background but not in the wild-type background strains, could be related to the presence of other factors, including the LPS in these strains that has masked the effect of plasmids on this phenomenon; this statement is supported by the resistance of the rough mutant which is usually hypersensitive to bile [57]. The mechanism of resistance encoded by the plasmid pChi7122-1 could be associated with proteins such as OmpT that was previously associated with bile resistance in Vibrio cholerae [58] and ABC transport proteins that are known to play a role in the protection of cells from toxic compounds [59]. Since such factors are not located on pChi7122-2, other factors predicted to be encoded by this plasmid, such as TA modules could be involved in bile tolerance of bacteria; as TA systems are now known to play an important role in bacterial stress physiology [60], [61], [62]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmids have been shown to be associated with the bile resistance of E. coli. Figure 5. Bile and acid tolerance of strains. Open in a new tab Bile sensitivity assay for E. coli K-12 and derivatives, no-plasmids (χ6092), pChi7122-1 (χ7346), pChi7122-2 (χ7347), and pChi7122-3 (χ7348). Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB and LB +1% (w/v) DOC agar plates. The approximate numbers of bacteria present in each dilution are indicated on the right side of the plate (A). Percent acid survival of wild-type derivative strains in acid shock for 18 hours (B). Abbreviations used are: pChi7122-1,2,3 = pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-1,2 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2; pChi7122-1,3 = pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-3; pChi7122-2-3 = pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3.Acid resistance is important for bacterial survival in acidic stomach or in foods with low pH [63]. Our results have shown that plasmids do not have any effect on the growth of the wild-type derived strains when grown in acidic medium for a short period (12 hours), as the strains with and without plasmids grew similarly (data not shown). However, at longer incubation times (18 hours), strains behaved differently (Fig. 5B). Similar to the study by Lim et al. [64] on the plasmid pO157 in E. coli O157, we have shown that in the absence of its three plasmids, the APEC strain survived better in acidic conditions than in their presence when incubated for 18 h. Moreover, our study showed that although the plasmid pChi7122-1, either alone or in combination with pChi7122-2 or pChi7122-3, decreased the acid tolerance of bacteria, the presence of pChi7122-3 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Since pChi7122-1 and pO157 play a major role in the virulence of APEC [12] and E. coli O157 [64] respectively, these findings could indicate that the presence of plasmids exert a cost to bacterial fitness when exposed for a long period (>18 hours) to acidic conditions, whereas bacteria containing other plasmids such as pChi7122-3 in χ7122 would have better survivability in these conditions. Elucidation of the mechanism of acid tolerance associated with pChi7122-3 is needed to fully understanding the persistence of E. coli in acidic conditions. Our study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78-antigen LPS for the acid tolerance of E. coli [65], and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response (Fig. 5B).Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically-important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65-80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm-related [66]. However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. ExPEC cells are found in biofilm-like communities in both gastrointestinal [67] and urinary tracts [68] indicating the importance of biofilms in the persistence of these bacteria. ExPEC bacteria have to adapt to extreme temperature changes. In this study, our strategy using three large plasmids, either individually or in combination in both an APEC wild-type and an E. coli K-12 background, and different O-LPS at different temperatures, has revealed new insights into biofilm formation of ExPEC. Altogether, our data distinguished four groups of factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, O-LPS-, and rough LPS-mediated biofilms in E. coli which differ in their expression conditions. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30°C than at 37°C or 42°C (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild-type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37° and 42°) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild-type strain, with the data being statistically significant (P<0.05) at 42°C (Fig. 6A). Figure 6. Effect of plasmids, O-LPS, and temperature on biofilm formation. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: χ7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No-plasmids (χ7368), pChi7122-1 (χ7394), pChi7122-2 (χ7392), pChi7122-3 (χ7367), pChi7122-1,2 (χ7561), pChi7122-1-3 (χ7562), and pChi7122-2,3 (χ7274) (A), E. coli K-12 (χ6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122-1 (χ7346), pChi7122-2 (χ7347), and pChi7122-3 (χ7348) (B), and χ7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78(-) (χ7145), smooth strains with either O1-LPS (O1) (χ7193) or O111-LPS (O111) (χ7167) (C) at either 30°C, 37°C, or 42°C.The biofilm formed by the plasmid-cured strain, highly produced at 30°C (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no-plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30°C and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion [69]. Expression of biofilm in the environment (30°C) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements. It has been shown that conjugative plasmids promote bacterial biofilm formation by generating F-pili mating pairs, which is important for early biofilm formation [70], [71], [72]. In this report, we have shown that plasmid-driven biofilms are very complex and this complexity is related to the nature of the plasmids, their combinations, host strain backgrounds, and the temperature to which the strains are exposed. The presence of the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A) and pChi7122-3 in the E. coli K-12 strain (Fig. 6B), had increased biofilm formation at host temperature conditions, with data being significant at 42°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6B). The fact that pChi7122-3-driven enhancement of bacterial biofilm was higher than those of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-1 in both wild-type and the E. coli K-12 backgrounds could be related to not only the tra genes expression [70], [71], [72] but also to the type IV fimbriae encoded by pChi7122-3, which was previously associated with the biofilm formation in enteroaggregative E. coli [73]. Plasmid-driven biofilms could be essential in the virulence process by giving bacteria a survival advantage in different niches of the host, which could result in disease. A controversy exists regarding the role of LPS in bacterial biofilm formation [74], [75]. In this study, we have shown that the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3 in wild-type derivative strains with different O-LPS backgrounds behaved differently in their biofilm formation (Fig. 6C). In absence of O78-LPS, the rough strain produced significantly (P<0.0001) less biofilm than its smooth wild-type strain at 30°C. Even though substitution of O78-LPS with O111-LPS had little effect on biofilm formation, the substitution of O78-LPS with O1-LPS has in contrary greatly enhanced biofilm formation in these bacteria at 30°C. Since the O1-LPS-driven enhancement of bacteria biofilm occurs at 30°C condition and is repressed at host temperatures (37°C/42°C), this indicates that its role could be more important in the persistence of bacteria in the environment, and that the temperature of 30°C in early O1-LPS-associated biofilm formation is necessary. The fact that O1-LPS-driven biofilm is not highly formed at 37°C and 42°C (Fig. 6C), could be related to a change in the LPS-O1 bilayer structure at higher temperature [76], [77], [78] leading to the disturbance of the early biofilm formed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of the nature of LPS on biofilm formation.Conclusion A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in other E. coli strains but found in Salmonella serovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriae pil operon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multiple plasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC χ7122. Large plasmids were involved in bile resistance (pChi7122-1 and pChi7122-2) when present in E. coli K-12 background and acid tolerance (pChi7122-3) in the wild-type background. Four different factor-driven biofilms, including plasmidless-, plasmid-, rough-LPS-, and O-LPS-mediated were demonstrated. These multiple factor-driven biofilms expressed at different temperatures could have distinct functions. Some of them could be important in the acquisition of genetic material and persistence of bacteria in the environment; others could be involved in virulence. The genotypic and phenotypic analysis of plasmid-derivative strains of an ExPEC model strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) revealed new insights into the mechanisms of fitness of ExPEC and their diversity.Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Most of the bacterial strains used in this study, listed in Table 1, are derived from the highly virulent APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) [79] and were fully described in our previous studies [10], [12], [80]. To evaluate the effect of the host strain background on plasmid-associated phenotypes, we used three derivatives of χ7122 with different LPS profiles containing the three plasmids pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2, and pChi7122-3; a rough mutant strain (O78-) of APEC χ7122, χ7145; and two derivatives of χ7145, χ7167 and χ7193, which respectively express O111 and O1 antigens rather than the native O78 antigen. We also used strains derived from an E. coli K-12, χ6092, containing either pChi7122-1, χ7346; pChi7122-2, χ7347; or pChi7122-3, χ7348 (Table 1, [10], [12], [80]). Antibiotic susceptibility testing of strains was performed and interpreted via disk diffusion method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [81], [82]. A collection of one hundred human strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) [19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were used to study the distribution of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3-associated genes among different groups of pathogenic E. coli by PCR. Unless otherwise stated, bacteria were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% lactose at 37°C. Strains were stored as stock cultures at −80°C in peptone-glycerol medium. All wild-type derivative strains grew similarly in LB and reached the OD600 ∼1.0 when incubated overnight (O/N) at 37°C standing, except the strain χ7561 (pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2) which had a slightly lower growth and its OD600 was around 0.8 when grown in the same conditions.Plasmid sequencing and annotation The DNA sequences of pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3 and pChi7122-4 plasmids were derived from contig sequences of the whole genomic DNA of APEC χ7122. The sequences were manipulated to the standard of an ‘Improved High-Quality Draft’ [83]. The program Artemis [84] was used to identify the plasmids and collate data. For each of the three plasmids all the sequence gaps were closed by directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products sequenced with big dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. All the plasmids were circularized and contiguated using this method. The DNA sequences were annotated to identify coding sequences and repeat sequences in Artemis and the vector NTI suite of programs was used to confirm the previous analysis. To identify plasmids with similar sequences, pChi7122-2 (FR851303) and pChi7122-3 (FR851304) were compared by BLASTn at . Plasmid sequences of pEG356 (FN594520.1) from Shigella sonnei, pHK01 (HM355591.1) from a urinary E. coli isolate, pAA (FN554767.1) from EAEC, and pKF3-70 (FJ494913.1) from K. pneumoniae, and R721 (AP002527.1) a trimethoprim and streptomycin resistant plasmid from an E. coli were downloaded. Plasmid sequences were aligned and then visualized using ACT and Mauve v2.3.1 [85]. Schematic plasmid drawings were constructed using DNAplotter [86]. Amino acid sequence and protein structural-based alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench software tool (v. 6.1 CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark) and the web-based interface for ESPript v.2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi) [87], respectively. The 3-D structure of the proteins pChiA, pChiT, pChiO, pChiD, and pChiR were predicted using position specific iterative (PSI)- BLAST alignment and HHpred [38].Prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV) genes among avian and human pathogenic E. coli One hundred human E. coli strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI) [19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five enteric E. coli strains (from our collection) were screened by PCR [19] for the presence of the eitA, pilS, and pilV genes using the primers eitA F: 5′-AACTGCGGCTATCAGGAGAC-3′ and eitA R : 5′-CAGGTCATATCCCACAGCTT-3′; pilS F: 5′-CTTCTCTTTCTGCACACCGT-3′ and pilS R: 5′-TGTGATTGTAACGGAGCC-3′; pilV F: 5′-TCTATACAGGCGAGTATTTA-3′ and pilV R: 5′-AATTCATACCAGAATACTCA-3′. The primers were designed from the sequence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilS and pilV).Growth comparison assays The growth rates of strains were compared in iron-sequestered medium using LB containing 100 µM of α,α′-dipyridyl alone or supplemented with either Heme (Sigma, 600 µg ml−1), hemoglobin (Sigma, 60 µg ml−1), or FeSO4 (Sigma, 20 mM: control). The growth rates were also tested in minimal medium MM9 [12], MM9 with thiamin (1 µg ml−1) and 0.1% casamino acid, and supplemented with glucose, lactose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, glucuronic acid, or glucoronic acid (0.2%) as source of carbon at 37°C shaking (180 rpm). The OD600 was recorded every hour over 24-hour period.Interaction of strains with 3-D INT-407 human epithelial cells 3-D cultures of human INT-407 cells (ATCC CCL6) were used as model intestinal epithelium and were prepared as previously described [54]. Approximately 106 CFU of PBS-washed bacteria, grown rotating to an OD600 1.0 in LB, were added to each well (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10). For bacterial association assays, the 24-well plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 hour, and rinsed three times with PBS. PBS-0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid sodium salt was added to each well, and samples were diluted and spread on MacConkey medium plates for enumeration by viable colony counting. For invasion assays, extracellular bacteria were killed following the initial 1-h incubation period by an additional 1-h incubation in medium containing gentamicin (100 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then washed 3× with PBS and lysed. Bacterial titers in the lysates were determined by serial dilutions and plating on MacConkey agar. The results were expressed as the Log10CFU/ml. Antibodies specific for O78-LPS (Denken Seiken) and the human tight junction protein ZO-1 (Invitrogen) were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging. Antibodies were of porcine and mouse origins, respectively, and were used at a dilution of 1∶500 (anti-O78-LPS) and 1∶100 (anti-ZO-1). Goat anti-porcine and anti-mouse secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies anti-O78-LPS and anti-ZO-1 respectively and were diluted 1∶500 in blocking solution (8% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton-X100 in DPBS). Cell nuclei and the F-actin cytoskeleton were visualized with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) and phalloidin (Invitrogen), respectively. The fixation and staining of 3-D aggregates was performed as described previously [88]. Optical sections of the 3-D aggregates were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for monitoring emissions of the selected fluorophores. Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil DIC objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package. Axiovision 4.8 software from Carl Zeiss was used to further process collected images.Sensitivity of strains to deoxycholate (DOC) and acid shock tolerance To determine the ability of bacteria to survive at sub-lethal bile concentration, different strains were grown rotating to an OD600 1.0 in LB medium. Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB agar and LB agar containing 1% (w/v) DOC plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. For acid shock assays, bacterial cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth, pH 7, O/N standing. Cultures adjusted to the same OD600 of 1.0 were diluted 1∶1,000 in LB, pH 2.5, and incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Samples were cultured by direct plating on LB agar after 8 h and 18 h to determine the percent survival following acid stress. As controls, bacteria were also grown in LB, pH 7 in the same conditions to determine if the growth of bacteria was affected.Biofilm formation assay Biofilm formation assays were performed in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) [89]. In brief, strains were grown to stationary phase in LB at 37°C and then diluted 1∶100 in LB supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) L-glucose. Aliquots of 200 µL for each dilution were dispensed per well into a microtiter plate (four wells/strain). Each strain was tested in quadruplicate, wells containing sterile medium were used as negative controls. Plates were sealed with parafilm and cultured standing either at 30°C, 37°C or 42°C for 5 days to mimic the environmental and body temperature of humans and chickens, respectively. The media of the plates were then decanted, and the plates were washed twice with sterile PBS. Microplates were then stained with 200 µL of 1% (w/v) Crystal Violet for 30 min, followed by washing twice with PBS to remove unbound dye. After drying, dye-containing adherent cells were resolubilized with 200 µL of 30% (v/v) acetic acid solution. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm in an ELISA reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices). All tests were carried out at least three times, and the results were averaged.Statistical analysis Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test (GraphPad Prism software, version 5.07). Differences between average values were also tested for significance by performing an unpaired, two-sided Student t test. The levels of significance (P values) are reported and values ≤0.05 were taken to be significant.Supporting Information Figure S1 Plasmids genomes comparison.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Cell Lines and NV Stocks INT-407 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) (CCL-6) and grown in GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) containing penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B. The human colonic adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (Caco-2; HTB-37) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was cultured in Earle minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell cultures were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. NV was purified from the stool specimens of infected volunteers by using a CsCl isopycnic ultracentrifugation gradient as described (5). Endotoxin levels were determined by using the Pyrotell Gel-Clot method (Associates of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA, USA), performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (31). NV was inactivated by γ-irradiation at doses of 4.25 kGy at room temperature by using a Gammacell-1000 Irradiator (Best Theratronics Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with a cesium-137 source, at a dose rate of 0.5 kGy/h. The titer of NV RNA in each fraction was determined by immunomagnetic capture reverse transcription (RT) PCR as described (31,34). 3-D INT-407 Model of Epithelium of Human Small Intestine The 3-D INT-407 model used in these studies was established by using procedures that were as close as possible to those previously described (30). In brief, the INT-407 cells were initially grown as monolayers in GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone) containing penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B at 37°C in 5% CO2 in preparation for seeding into the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (35). A total of ≈2 × 106 cells were subsequently added to the RWV containing 0.25 mg/mL porous Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a ratio of ≈10 cells/bead. Cells were then cultured in the RWV at 18–20 rotations/min as described (30,35). Fresh medium was replenished every 24–72 h, depending on metabolic activity of cultures. Intestinal aggregates were harvested for use in all studies 28–35 days after they were seeded into the RWV. NV Infection By using a wide-bore pipette (10-mL wide), mature aggregates in 250 μL of GTSF-2 medium were seeded into a 24-well plate (≈1×106 cells/well) and infected with NV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 (live or inactivated) for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Plates were rocked every 15 min during the 1-h absorption phase and then overlaid with 750 μL of fresh medium. Wells were incubated for 0-, 6-, 24-, 48-, 72-, or 96-h following infection, imaged, and harvested for RNA extraction or immunofluorescence analysis. NV RNA Extraction RNA was extracted from samples by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) and converted to cDNA by RT by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was stored at −20°C until further analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out in 25 μL of a reaction mixture containing 2.5 μL of cDNA, 12.5 μL of Supermix (BioRad), a 400 nmol/L concentration of each primer designed to bind to the open reading frame 1 and 2 junction (36), and 15 pmol of RING1(a)-TaqMan probe and 5 pmol of RING1(b)-TaqMan probe fluorogenic probes for NV genogroup I (GI) detection. PCR amplification was performed with an iQ5 cycler (BioRad) as described (36). For each PCR, an NV GI-specific standard curve was generated by a 10-fold serial dilution (109–103 copies) of purified NV GI cDNA plasmids. Microscopy Analysis Phase-contrast images were produced on a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) by using Axiovision 4 software (Carl Zeiss) for image processing. For analysis by confocal microscopy, confluent Caco-2 monolayers, INT-407 monolayers, and 3-D INT-407 aggregates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked at 37°C for 1 h in 4% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained with anti-H type 1 antibodies (BG-4 [#SIG-313]; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA; and UEA-1 lectin [L#8146]; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-H type 2–specific monoclonal antibody (Biogenesis; Poole, UK), anti-Lea monoclonal antibody (#4861; Immucor Gamma, Atlanta, GA, USA), and anti-Leb monoclonal antibody (BG-6 [#SIG-3315]; Covance) for 2 h at 37°C at 1:25 dilution. Antiviral protein (VP) 1 and VPg antibodies were used as described (5). Unstained control slides and PBS control samples were also used to distinguish background and establish appropriate laser intensity for visualizing experimental slides. Samples were analyzed by using the Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope and a 63× objective and Zeiss LSM software. FUT2 Genotyping Assays DNA was extracted from 200 μL of INT-407 cell pellets by using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN). A region of the FUT2 gene was amplified, by using the following primers: forward 5′-CCCATCTTCAGAATCACCCTGCCGGTGCTG-3′, and reverse 5′-TCGGCCGGCCCGTGGAAACATCCCCAGGTA-3′, which anneal at positions 280–309 and 535–564, respectively, as described (18). Results were analyzed as described; in brief, homozygous amino acid at position 428 or TT at position 385 of the FUT2 gene defines a secretor-negative genotype (18,31). Lipopolysaccharide Treatment Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (106 EU/mg) was purchased from InvivoGen (LPS-EB; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA). Aggregates were treated with PBS (negative control) or LPS doses ranging from 0.01 to 100.0 μg/mL and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Statistical Analyses Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to graph all data and to perform statistical analyses. One-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis, was used to make statistical comparisons for qRT-PCR analysis. For statistical significance, p<0.05 was considered significant and p<0.01 was considered highly significant.",
    "results": "Results NV Challenge and CPE-like Effects in 3-D INT-407 Aggregates Straub et al. (30) previously reported the use of RWV-derived 3-D INT-407 models of small intestinal epithelium for successful NV infection, demonstrated in part by cellular vacuolization and detachment after a 24-h challenge with unpurified extracts obtained from human stool specimens that contained genogroup I or genogroup II NoVs (30). To test whether exposure to NV led to gross morphologic changes in 3-D INT-407 aggregates, we prepared a highly purified and concentrated (1.63×109 RNA genomic copies/μL) stock of NV. (Notably, Straub et al. used virus stocks that were clarified by using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter [30]). A γ-irradiated NV stock was used as a negative control for NV infectivity and replication because this treatment inactivates virus but preserves the integrity of the virus and the remaining components of the sample (31). Three-dimensional INT-407 aggregates were inoculated with live NV or γ-irradiated NV or mock-inoculated with media alone (uninfected) at an MOI of 25 for 6, 12, and 24 h and monitored for potential CPE by light microscopy (Figure 1). Twelve hours post inoculation (hpi), morphologic changes initially attributed to CPE were observed in the 3-D aggregates. These observed morphologic changes included changes in size, shape, and clumping of cells, and detachment of cells from the beads on which the cells had been cultured. In Figure 1, the arrows indicate dissociated cells. Larger distinct circular beads without attached intestinal cells are more abundant in the samples showing damage. These CPE-like morphologic changes were not observed in the uninfected or inactivated samples, which suggests that the NV stock was able to induce gross morphologic changes in the 3-D intestinal aggregates. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Morphologic changes in Norwalk virus (NV)–infected 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates. Phase contrast micrographs of 3-dimensional intestinal aggregates cultured in the rotating wall vessel bioreactor and subsequently inoculated with live NV (panels A–C), inactivated NV (γ-inactivated) (panels D–F), or phosphate-buffered saline (mock-uninfected control) (panels G–I) at 6, 12, and 24 h after inoculation. Arrows indicate cells (or cellular debris) that were released from the support beads. The beads appear as large, distinct spheres after the removal of bound cells. Original magnification ×20. 3-D INT-407 Aggregates and NV Replication To determine whether the CPE-like morphologic changes observed in 3-D INT-407 aggregates were a direct result of NV replication, we performed a kinetic analysis of NV RNA levels by qRT-PCR following NV challenge (Figure 2). The 3-D aggregates were challenged at an MOI of 25 (≈4 × 109 copies of NV total) with live or γ-inactivated NV or mock-challenged with media alone. At each time point (0, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi), cellular pellets (containing possible intracellular and cell-associated virus) and supernatants (containing input and released virus) were harvested for RNA extraction, and viral RNA titers were quantified by qRT-PCR. NV RNA copy numbers (indicative of viral replication) did not significantly (p>0.05) increase relative to input copies at any of the time points measured in both cell pellets and culture supernatants (Figure 2). The input virus served as a positive control and for establishing baseline RNA levels for comparison with those of the experimental samples. NV RNA consistently decreased over time in this experiment; however, the differences between these decreases and levels of input virus NV RNA copies over time were not statistically significant for either live or γ-irradiated NV inoculations. These data clearly illustrate that viral RNA levels were not increasing over time as would be expected during a productive viral infection. Figure 2. Open in a new tab No evidence of productive Norwalk virus (NV) replication in 3-dimensional intestinal aggregates by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. Supernatants (sups) and cell pellets were harvested for RNA at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postinoculation (hpi) with live and inactivated NV and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. There was no significant increase (p>0.05) in NV RNA copy number over time in the supernatants or cell pellets relative to input virus. Error bars indicate SEM.To further investigate whether the 3-D aggregates were productively infected, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze 3-D INT-407 aggregates challenged with live NV, γ-irradiated NV, or media alone (mock) and monitored for the presence of NV structural (VP1) and nonstructural (VPg) proteins (Figure 3). During productive NV replication, both structural and nonstructural proteins are detected within cells (5). After 24 hpi, VP1 and VPg proteins were detected in the live NV-inoculated aggregates (Figure 3, panels A and B); however, by 48 hpi, evidence for these proteins had markedly diminished and the images resembled the NV-inactivated images (Figure 3, panels C–H). We conclude that the VP1 signal at 24 hpi is most likely a result of input virus and not viral replication, consistent with the qRT-PCR data (Figure 2). The faint VPg signal observed may be nonspecific staining or low-level initial gene expression that does not lead to permissive replication. Figure 3. Open in a new tab No evidence of productive Norwalk virus (NV) replication in 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates by confocal microscopy analysis of viral proteins. Three-dimensional INT-407 aggregates 24 h post inoculation (hpi) (panels A, B) and 48 hpi (panels C, D) with live NV, 24 hpi with inactivated NV (panels E, F), or phosphate-buffered saline alone controls (panels G, H). Aggregates were stained for viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) (panels A, C, E, G) or nonstructural protein VPg (panels B, D, F, H). Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (not shown in print issue). Original magnification ×63. 3-D INT-407 Aggregates and Surface Carbohydrate Tropism To better understand why these 3-D intestinal aggregates were not able to productively support NV replication, we characterized them for HBGA expression. NV has been demonstrated to bind to H-type antigens on the surface of mammalian cells, and this binding has been hypothesized to be the mechanism for NV to enter human cells (5,16,17,19,21). To determine whether 3-D intestinal aggregates contain the FUT2 gene that converts precursor molecules to H-type antigens (21), we performed genotyping analysis on the INT-407 intestinal cells used to produce the organotypic cell culture model. The intestinal cell line was shown to contain the genetic determinants to express a functional FUT2 (data not shown); therefore, the INT-407 cell line (used to make the 3-D intestinal model) is likely a secretor-positive cell line with the potential to express the H-type receptors necessary for NV binding and, presumably, for infection. However, after performing H-type antigen phenotyping by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on monolayers and 3-D differentiated intestinal cells, we were unable to detect H type 1 on the surface of the cells by using 2 antibodies specific for different regions of the antigen (Figure 4) (5). Further confocal analysis of the INT-407 cells also showed no expression of the other carbohydrate antigens involved in binding of other genogroups of NoV, H type 2, Leb, although minimal antigen expression of Lea was observed. Caco-2 cells are shown as a positive control for staining of the surface glycans (5). These data demonstrate that both monolayer and 3-D intestinal models lack sufficient expression of the cell surface receptors believed to be required for susceptibility to NV infection. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Three-dimensional (3-D) INT-407 intestinal cell aggregates do not express the histo-blood group antigens important for Norwalk virus (NV) attachment. Monolayer (ML) INT-407, 3-D INT-407 aggregates, and Caco-2 ML (positive control) were labeled with 2 different H type 1 (BG-4 and UEA-1) antibodies and with antibodies against H type 2, Leb, and Lea (green) and imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Scale bars = 50 μm. LPS and CPE-like Morphologic Changes in 3-D INT-407 Aggregates Our data clearly demonstrate that the 3-D intestinal aggregates do not support a productive NV replication; however, we did observe CPE-like morphologic changes after treatment with highly purified NV (Figure 1). One potential cause of these morphologic changes in the 3-D intestinal aggregates could be the presence of contamination of the NV stocks with a bacterial endotoxin, LPS, or other potentially cytotoxic molecules commonly found in human stool samples (the source of virus used in our studies and those of Straub et al. [30]). The highly purified virus preparations used in this study were determined to contain low LPS levels, resulting in 10 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL of LPS for live NV and γ-irradiated NV stocks, respectively, added to the aggregates on NV inoculation. LPS is a known cytotoxic inflammation-inducing product; we therefore hypothesized that the contaminating LPS could be a potential cause of the CPE-like morphologic changes observed after NV inoculation. To test whether LPS alone induces comparable CPE-like effects at relevant concentrations in the 3-D intestinal aggregates, we treated the aggregates with increasing amounts of LPS (InvivoGen) and monitored for alterations in morphology indicative of cytotoxicity (Figure 5). After 24 h, aggregates treated with a range of LPS concentrations (0.01–100.0 µg/mL) exhibited increasing signs of CPE, as shown by cellular dissociation from the support beads and a partial loss of cell viability (Technical Appendix Figure 1). In comparison with the morphologic changes shown in the technical appendix figure (observed with NV addition to the aggregates), we found that LPS at levels of ≈1 µg/mL was able to induce the CPE-like morphologic changes equivalent to those induced by inoculation of nonpurified NV. Although these levels are higher than the measured level of LPS in the purified NV samples we used, there might also be additional cytotoxic contaminants that were carried from the infected patients’ stool specimens. When these data are taken together, we interpret them as indicating the CPE-like morphologic changes were caused by stool-derived NV samples (Technical Appendix Figure and [30]) contaminated with LPS, and perhaps other cytotoxins, and were not a result of virus replication. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces morphologic changes consistent with cytopathic effects in Norwalk virus–inoculated 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates. Two independent sets of light microscopy images show 3-D intestinal aggregates treated with increasing concentrations of LPS for 24 h.

    "discussion": "Discussion Using the same RWV bioreactor cell culture system described by Straub et al. (30) to generate well-differentiated 3-D organotypic intestinal epithelial aggregates derived from INT-407 cells, we attempted to validate the published report and further characterize the 3-D intestinal model for NV infection studies. Following a 24-h inoculation of the 3-D INT-407 aggregates with highly purified NV stock, we observed similar morphologic changes to the cells as previously reported (30). However, the CPE-like effects observed did not correlate with NV replication, because no measurable increase in viral RNA occurred in a period up to 96 hpi. Rather, CPE-like effects can be mimicked by addition of a known component of human stool samples—LPS. In addition, no increase in viral (structural or nonstructural) proteins could be detected within the aggregates after challenge with NV. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that morphologic changes of the 3-D aggregates after NV inoculation, as observed herein and by Straub et al. (30), were most likely a result of LPS within the virus inocula and not due to NV replication. Our observed lack of HBGA carbohydrates on the surface of the intestinal cells that participate in NV binding to mammalian cells further highlights that this model is likely not a sufficient model system to study NV replication because the cells do not express the putative NV receptor. Previous studies determined that overexpression of FUT2 in natively nonexpressing or low-expressing cell types, or upon differentiation of Caco-2 cells that natively express FUT2, results in a dramatic increase in NV particle binding (5,19,32,37,38). However, this binding was not sufficient to result in NV infection and replication within these cell types (5). Transfecting cells expressing FUT2 with NV RNA (isolated from virus from the stool samples of infected volunteers) did result in NV replication and synthesis of NV proteins within the cells, suggesting that the block in NV replication following virus addition to the cells occurs at a postbinding step and may require an additional cellular factor for viral entry and/or uncoating (5,32,38,39). Recently, Lay et al. took a different approach to culture NV: they used primary macrophages and dendritic cells from secretor-positive persons/donors to test their ability to support a NV infection (31). Unlike the case with murine NoV, these primary immune cells were unsuccessful in supporting NV infection (11,31). Future attempts to develop in vitro systems to study NoV replication may include cultures derived from human primary intestinal cells and tissue explants, utilization of Caco-2 cells grown in RWV, use of 3-D intestinal immunocompetent coculture models, or human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (40,41). These models alone, or in combination, may provide a meaningful way to obtain a system(s) to support productive NoV infection and replication and thus serve as useful tools for studying NoV.",

Keywords: norovirus replication, 3-D intestinal epithelial cell culture, INT-407, blood group H type antigens, Lewis blood-group system, human intestinal epithelial cells, rotating wall vessel bioreactor, Norwalk virus, virusesAbstract Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication. Norovirus (NoV) has been identified as the primary etiologic agent of acute epidemic viral gastroenteritis in industrialized countries (1,2). Norwalk virus (NV) is the human prototype GI.1 NoV strain; it belongs to the Caliciviridae family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses (3). Human-to-human transmission of NoV occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, with the small intestine being the initial site of viral replication (1,4). The lack of an efficient cell culture system in which to study NoV infections has hindered development of antiviral drugs to control or limit NoV outbreaks (5). Currently, animal models are being used to increase our understanding of NoV infections (6–12); however, no small animal model for NoV mimics the disease manifestations observed in humans (7,11–13). As a result, human outbreaks and volunteer studies have been the primary source for existing knowledge of NV epidemiology and pathogenesis, respectively (1,14,15). A major finding from human NV volunteer studies is that persons with strains containing 2 mutated alleles of the α(1,2) fucosyltransferase (FUT2) gene were resistant to NV infection (16–20). FUT2 encodes an enzyme that produces histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) on the surface of epithelial cells and in mucosal secretions (21,22). Persons who lack a functional FUT2 gene cannot generate ABH antigens in secretions and, thus, are termed nonsecretors (23,24). HBGA are complex carbohydrates distinguished by different monosaccharides added to a precursor oligosaccharide by fucosyltransferase enzymes (23,24). In the human gastroduodenal junction where NV has been shown to bind HBGA type 1 (Lewis b [Leb]), is found exclusively on epithelial surfaces, whereas HBGA type 2 is primarily found at the glandular level (19,24–26). In vitro experiments using NV virus-like particles (VLPs) directly showed NV VLP attachment to HBGA, resulting in VLP internalization into the cell (19). In addition, NV VLPs were found to preferentially bind to A and H type 1 and Leb carbohydrates (19,27–29). From these critical studies, putative NV receptors were identified, and thus it was hypothesized that a successful in vitro cell culture system would most likely possess these receptors to support NV replication. Although most of the understanding of NoV infections in humans has been derived from volunteer studies and authentic sporadic outbreaks, extensive volunteer studies have limitations (variability, cost, and institutional review board considerations). As a result, many attempts have been made to develop a reproducible in vitro model system to culture NoV, but none has yet proved successful (13,30–33). However, one publication has reported establishing a productive NoV infection in a 3-dimensional (3-D) organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium derived from the human embryonic intestinal epithelial cell line INT-407 (30). We report here an unsuccessful attempt to replicate these findings using NV. Materials and Methods Cell Lines and NV Stocks INT-407 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) (CCL-6) and grown in GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) containing penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B. The human colonic adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (Caco-2; HTB-37) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was cultured in Earle minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell cultures were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2. NV was purified from the stool specimens of infected volunteers by using a CsCl isopycnic ultracentrifugation gradient as described (5). Endotoxin levels were determined by using the Pyrotell Gel-Clot method (Associates of Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth, MA, USA), performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (31). NV was inactivated by γ-irradiation at doses of 4.25 kGy at room temperature by using a Gammacell-1000 Irradiator (Best Theratronics Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with a cesium-137 source, at a dose rate of 0.5 kGy/h. The titer of NV RNA in each fraction was determined by immunomagnetic capture reverse transcription (RT) PCR as described (31,34).3-D INT-407 Model of Epithelium of Human Small Intestine The 3-D INT-407 model used in these studies was established by using procedures that were as close as possible to those previously described (30). In brief, the INT-407 cells were initially grown as monolayers in GTSF-2 medium (Hyclone) containing penicillin/streptomycin and amphotericin B at 37°C in 5% CO2 in preparation for seeding into the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (35). A total of ≈2 × 106 cells were subsequently added to the RWV containing 0.25 mg/mL porous Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a ratio of ≈10 cells/bead. Cells were then cultured in the RWV at 18–20 rotations/min as described (30,35). Fresh medium was replenished every 24–72 h, depending on metabolic activity of cultures. Intestinal aggregates were harvested for use in all studies 28–35 days after they were seeded into the RWV.NV Infection By using a wide-bore pipette (10-mL wide), mature aggregates in 250 μL of GTSF-2 medium were seeded into a 24-well plate (≈1×106 cells/well) and infected with NV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 (live or inactivated) for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Plates were rocked every 15 min during the 1-h absorption phase and then overlaid with 750 μL of fresh medium. Wells were incubated for 0-, 6-, 24-, 48-, 72-, or 96-h following infection, imaged, and harvested for RNA extraction or immunofluorescence analysis.NV RNA Extraction RNA was extracted from samples by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) and converted to cDNA by RT by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was stored at −20°C until further analysis.Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out in 25 μL of a reaction mixture containing 2.5 μL of cDNA, 12.5 μL of Supermix (BioRad), a 400 nmol/L concentration of each primer designed to bind to the open reading frame 1 and 2 junction (36), and 15 pmol of RING1(a)-TaqMan probe and 5 pmol of RING1(b)-TaqMan probe fluorogenic probes for NV genogroup I (GI) detection. PCR amplification was performed with an iQ5 cycler (BioRad) as described (36). For each PCR, an NV GI-specific standard curve was generated by a 10-fold serial dilution (109–103 copies) of purified NV GI cDNA plasmids.Microscopy Analysis Phase-contrast images were produced on a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) by using Axiovision 4 software (Carl Zeiss) for image processing. For analysis by confocal microscopy, confluent Caco-2 monolayers, INT-407 monolayers, and 3-D INT-407 aggregates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked at 37°C for 1 h in 4% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained with anti-H type 1 antibodies (BG-4 [#SIG-313]; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA; and UEA-1 lectin [L#8146]; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-H type 2–specific monoclonal antibody (Biogenesis; Poole, UK), anti-Lea monoclonal antibody (#4861; Immucor Gamma, Atlanta, GA, USA), and anti-Leb monoclonal antibody (BG-6 [#SIG-3315]; Covance) for 2 h at 37°C at 1:25 dilution. Antiviral protein (VP) 1 and VPg antibodies were used as described (5). Unstained control slides and PBS control samples were also used to distinguish background and establish appropriate laser intensity for visualizing experimental slides. Samples were analyzed by using the Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope and a 63× objective and Zeiss LSM software. FUT2 Genotyping Assays DNA was extracted from 200 μL of INT-407 cell pellets by using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN). A region of the FUT2 gene was amplified, by using the following primers: forward 5′-CCCATCTTCAGAATCACCCTGCCGGTGCTG-3′, and reverse 5′-TCGGCCGGCCCGTGGAAACATCCCCAGGTA-3′, which anneal at positions 280–309 and 535–564, respectively, as described (18). Results were analyzed as described; in brief, homozygous amino acid at position 428 or TT at position 385 of the FUT2 gene defines a secretor-negative genotype (18,31).Lipopolysaccharide Treatment Escherichia coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (106 EU/mg) was purchased from InvivoGen (LPS-EB; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA). Aggregates were treated with PBS (negative control) or LPS doses ranging from 0.01 to 100.0 μg/mL and incubated for 24 h at 37°C.Statistical Analyses Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to graph all data and to perform statistical analyses. One-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis, was used to make statistical comparisons for qRT-PCR analysis. For statistical significance, p<0.05 was considered significant and p<0.01 was considered highly significant.Results NV Challenge and CPE-like Effects in 3-D INT-407 Aggregates Straub et al. (30) previously reported the use of RWV-derived 3-D INT-407 models of small intestinal epithelium for successful NV infection, demonstrated in part by cellular vacuolization and detachment after a 24-h challenge with unpurified extracts obtained from human stool specimens that contained genogroup I or genogroup II NoVs (30). To test whether exposure to NV led to gross morphologic changes in 3-D INT-407 aggregates, we prepared a highly purified and concentrated (1.63×109 RNA genomic copies/μL) stock of NV. (Notably, Straub et al. used virus stocks that were clarified by using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter [30]). A γ-irradiated NV stock was used as a negative control for NV infectivity and replication because this treatment inactivates virus but preserves the integrity of the virus and the remaining components of the sample (31). Three-dimensional INT-407 aggregates were inoculated with live NV or γ-irradiated NV or mock-inoculated with media alone (uninfected) at an MOI of 25 for 6, 12, and 24 h and monitored for potential CPE by light microscopy (Figure 1). Twelve hours post inoculation (hpi), morphologic changes initially attributed to CPE were observed in the 3-D aggregates. These observed morphologic changes included changes in size, shape, and clumping of cells, and detachment of cells from the beads on which the cells had been cultured. In Figure 1, the arrows indicate dissociated cells. Larger distinct circular beads without attached intestinal cells are more abundant in the samples showing damage. These CPE-like morphologic changes were not observed in the uninfected or inactivated samples, which suggests that the NV stock was able to induce gross morphologic changes in the 3-D intestinal aggregates. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Morphologic changes in Norwalk virus (NV)–infected 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates. Phase contrast micrographs of 3-dimensional intestinal aggregates cultured in the rotating wall vessel bioreactor and subsequently inoculated with live NV (panels A–C), inactivated NV (γ-inactivated) (panels D–F), or phosphate-buffered saline (mock-uninfected control) (panels G–I) at 6, 12, and 24 h after inoculation. Arrows indicate cells (or cellular debris) that were released from the support beads. The beads appear as large, distinct spheres after the removal of bound cells. Original magnification ×20.3-D INT-407 Aggregates and NV Replication To determine whether the CPE-like morphologic changes observed in 3-D INT-407 aggregates were a direct result of NV replication, we performed a kinetic analysis of NV RNA levels by qRT-PCR following NV challenge (Figure 2). The 3-D aggregates were challenged at an MOI of 25 (≈4 × 109 copies of NV total) with live or γ-inactivated NV or mock-challenged with media alone. At each time point (0, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi), cellular pellets (containing possible intracellular and cell-associated virus) and supernatants (containing input and released virus) were harvested for RNA extraction, and viral RNA titers were quantified by qRT-PCR. NV RNA copy numbers (indicative of viral replication) did not significantly (p>0.05) increase relative to input copies at any of the time points measured in both cell pellets and culture supernatants (Figure 2). The input virus served as a positive control and for establishing baseline RNA levels for comparison with those of the experimental samples. NV RNA consistently decreased over time in this experiment; however, the differences between these decreases and levels of input virus NV RNA copies over time were not statistically significant for either live or γ-irradiated NV inoculations. These data clearly illustrate that viral RNA levels were not increasing over time as would be expected during a productive viral infection. Figure 2. Open in a new tab No evidence of productive Norwalk virus (NV) replication in 3-dimensional intestinal aggregates by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. Supernatants (sups) and cell pellets were harvested for RNA at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postinoculation (hpi) with live and inactivated NV and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. There was no significant increase (p>0.05) in NV RNA copy number over time in the supernatants or cell pellets relative to input virus. Error bars indicate SEM.To further investigate whether the 3-D aggregates were productively infected, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze 3-D INT-407 aggregates challenged with live NV, γ-irradiated NV, or media alone (mock) and monitored for the presence of NV structural (VP1) and nonstructural (VPg) proteins (Figure 3). During productive NV replication, both structural and nonstructural proteins are detected within cells (5). After 24 hpi, VP1 and VPg proteins were detected in the live NV-inoculated aggregates (Figure 3, panels A and B); however, by 48 hpi, evidence for these proteins had markedly diminished and the images resembled the NV-inactivated images (Figure 3, panels C–H). We conclude that the VP1 signal at 24 hpi is most likely a result of input virus and not viral replication, consistent with the qRT-PCR data (Figure 2). The faint VPg signal observed may be nonspecific staining or low-level initial gene expression that does not lead to permissive replication. Figure 3. Open in a new tab No evidence of productive Norwalk virus (NV) replication in 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates by confocal microscopy analysis of viral proteins. Three-dimensional INT-407 aggregates 24 h post inoculation (hpi) (panels A, B) and 48 hpi (panels C, D) with live NV, 24 hpi with inactivated NV (panels E, F), or phosphate-buffered saline alone controls (panels G, H). Aggregates were stained for viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) (panels A, C, E, G) or nonstructural protein VPg (panels B, D, F, H). Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (not shown in print issue). Original magnification ×63. 3-D INT-407 Aggregates and Surface Carbohydrate Tropism To better understand why these 3-D intestinal aggregates were not able to productively support NV replication, we characterized them for HBGA expression. NV has been demonstrated to bind to H-type antigens on the surface of mammalian cells, and this binding has been hypothesized to be the mechanism for NV to enter human cells (5,16,17,19,21). To determine whether 3-D intestinal aggregates contain the FUT2 gene that converts precursor molecules to H-type antigens (21), we performed genotyping analysis on the INT-407 intestinal cells used to produce the organotypic cell culture model. The intestinal cell line was shown to contain the genetic determinants to express a functional FUT2 (data not shown); therefore, the INT-407 cell line (used to make the 3-D intestinal model) is likely a secretor-positive cell line with the potential to express the H-type receptors necessary for NV binding and, presumably, for infection. However, after performing H-type antigen phenotyping by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on monolayers and 3-D differentiated intestinal cells, we were unable to detect H type 1 on the surface of the cells by using 2 antibodies specific for different regions of the antigen (Figure 4) (5). Further confocal analysis of the INT-407 cells also showed no expression of the other carbohydrate antigens involved in binding of other genogroups of NoV, H type 2, Leb, although minimal antigen expression of Lea was observed. Caco-2 cells are shown as a positive control for staining of the surface glycans (5). These data demonstrate that both monolayer and 3-D intestinal models lack sufficient expression of the cell surface receptors believed to be required for susceptibility to NV infection. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Three-dimensional (3-D) INT-407 intestinal cell aggregates do not express the histo-blood group antigens important for Norwalk virus (NV) attachment. Monolayer (ML) INT-407, 3-D INT-407 aggregates, and Caco-2 ML (positive control) were labeled with 2 different H type 1 (BG-4 and UEA-1) antibodies and with antibodies against H type 2, Leb, and Lea (green) and imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). Scale bars = 50 μm. LPS and CPE-like Morphologic Changes in 3-D INT-407 Aggregates Our data clearly demonstrate that the 3-D intestinal aggregates do not support a productive NV replication; however, we did observe CPE-like morphologic changes after treatment with highly purified NV (Figure 1). One potential cause of these morphologic changes in the 3-D intestinal aggregates could be the presence of contamination of the NV stocks with a bacterial endotoxin, LPS, or other potentially cytotoxic molecules commonly found in human stool samples (the source of virus used in our studies and those of Straub et al. [30]). The highly purified virus preparations used in this study were determined to contain low LPS levels, resulting in 10 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL of LPS for live NV and γ-irradiated NV stocks, respectively, added to the aggregates on NV inoculation. LPS is a known cytotoxic inflammation-inducing product; we therefore hypothesized that the contaminating LPS could be a potential cause of the CPE-like morphologic changes observed after NV inoculation. To test whether LPS alone induces comparable CPE-like effects at relevant concentrations in the 3-D intestinal aggregates, we treated the aggregates with increasing amounts of LPS (InvivoGen) and monitored for alterations in morphology indicative of cytotoxicity (Figure 5). After 24 h, aggregates treated with a range of LPS concentrations (0.01–100.0 µg/mL) exhibited increasing signs of CPE, as shown by cellular dissociation from the support beads and a partial loss of cell viability (Technical Appendix Figure 1). In comparison with the morphologic changes shown in the technical appendix figure (observed with NV addition to the aggregates), we found that LPS at levels of ≈1 µg/mL was able to induce the CPE-like morphologic changes equivalent to those induced by inoculation of nonpurified NV. Although these levels are higher than the measured level of LPS in the purified NV samples we used, there might also be additional cytotoxic contaminants that were carried from the infected patients’ stool specimens. When these data are taken together, we interpret them as indicating the CPE-like morphologic changes were caused by stool-derived NV samples (Technical Appendix Figure and [30]) contaminated with LPS, and perhaps other cytotoxins, and were not a result of virus replication. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces morphologic changes consistent with cytopathic effects in Norwalk virus–inoculated 3-dimensional INT-407 aggregates. Two independent sets of light microscopy images show 3-D intestinal aggregates treated with increasing concentrations of LPS for 24 h. Arrows indicate cells (or cellular debris) that were released from the support beads. Original magnification ×20.Discussion Using the same RWV bioreactor cell culture system described by Straub et al. (30) to generate well-differentiated 3-D organotypic intestinal epithelial aggregates derived from INT-407 cells, we attempted to validate the published report and further characterize the 3-D intestinal model for NV infection studies. Following a 24-h inoculation of the 3-D INT-407 aggregates with highly purified NV stock, we observed similar morphologic changes to the cells as previously reported (30). However, the CPE-like effects observed did not correlate with NV replication, because no measurable increase in viral RNA occurred in a period up to 96 hpi. Rather, CPE-like effects can be mimicked by addition of a known component of human stool samples—LPS. In addition, no increase in viral (structural or nonstructural) proteins could be detected within the aggregates after challenge with NV. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that morphologic changes of the 3-D aggregates after NV inoculation, as observed herein and by Straub et al. (30), were most likely a result of LPS within the virus inocula and not due to NV replication. Our observed lack of HBGA carbohydrates on the surface of the intestinal cells that participate in NV binding to mammalian cells further highlights that this model is likely not a sufficient model system to study NV replication because the cells do not express the putative NV receptor. Previous studies determined that overexpression of FUT2 in natively nonexpressing or low-expressing cell types, or upon differentiation of Caco-2 cells that natively express FUT2, results in a dramatic increase in NV particle binding (5,19,32,37,38). However, this binding was not sufficient to result in NV infection and replication within these cell types (5). Transfecting cells expressing FUT2 with NV RNA (isolated from virus from the stool samples of infected volunteers) did result in NV replication and synthesis of NV proteins within the cells, suggesting that the block in NV replication following virus addition to the cells occurs at a postbinding step and may require an additional cellular factor for viral entry and/or uncoating (5,32,38,39). Recently, Lay et al. took a different approach to culture NV: they used primary macrophages and dendritic cells from secretor-positive persons/donors to test their ability to support a NV infection (31). Unlike the case with murine NoV, these primary immune cells were unsuccessful in supporting NV infection (11,31). Future attempts to develop in vitro systems to study NoV replication may include cultures derived from human primary intestinal cells and tissue explants, utilization of Caco-2 cells grown in RWV, use of 3-D intestinal immunocompetent coculture models, or human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (40,41). These models alone, or in combination, may provide a meaningful way to obtain a system(s) to support productive NoV infection and replication and thus serve as useful tools for studying NoV.

Keywords: Enterobacteriaceae, environmental response, low shear modeled microgravity, rotating wall vessel, Salmonella Typhimurium.INTRODUCTION A large body of studies aimed at characterizing the effects of low fluid shear force environments on bacterial cells,including the microgravity environment of spaceflight and ground-based rotating wall vessel (RWV) culture, have focused on the Gram negative enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [1-7]. Other studies have also focused on additional bacteria including Escherichia coli [8-15], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [16-18], Yersinia pestis [19, 20], and Staphylococcus aureus [15, 21, 22] with a range of different phenotypic results. However, the range of bacteria capable of responding to this condition and the potential similarities/differences in this response remain poorly characterized. Additionally, to our knowledge, a systematic, “side-by-side” study to examine the conservation of the low fluid shear response in a range of different bacterial genera using common assay conditions has not been reported in the literature. In this study,we analyzed different members of the Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae family for conservation of the low fluid shear response in the RWV using phenotypic and molecular assays to delineate the commonalities and differences of these organisms to culture in this environmental condition. Many members of the Enterobactericeae family are enteric organisms that inhabit the intestine as part of their lifecycles, and consequently, these bacteria likely encounter low fluid shear regions in their natural habitat such as the spaces between microvilli [23]. In addition, as bacterial engineering expands to include a larger range of bacteria, the use of novel growth conditions will be applied to a greater variety of genera. The RWV culture apparatus (Fig. 1) allows a physiolo-gically-relevant low fluid shear force growth environment that induces a number of phenotypic responses in bacteria including altered stress resistance [1-5, 7, 12, 16, 21], increased survival in cellular and animal hosts [1, 3, 4, 7], and altered gene expression [1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 14, 17, 18]. The RWV is used to induce prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular phenotypes that are difficult or not possible to obtain using conventional culture conditions [1, 18, 21, 24]. This includes use as a ground-based modeled microgravity environment to study effects/phenotypes that correlate to those observed in spaceflight experiments [3, 7, 17, 24]. The alteration of bacterial virulence observed during growth in spaceflight and in the RWV is currently being used for applications related to bacterial engineering and modification via growth conditions [1, 3, 7, 18, 25-27]. Given these commonalities and based upon previous modeling, the environmental growth condition obtained in the RWV apparatus has been termed low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [2, 4, 5]. Fig. (1). Open in a new tab The rotating wall vessel (RWV). Panel A: The rotating wall vessel serves as a low fluid shear cell culture apparatus. The vessel is completely filled with media containing cells (no air bubbles) and rotated at 25 rpm. In the pictured orientation of the vessel (LSMMG condition), this creates a low shear, low turbulence suspension culture environment for cell growth. Aeration is provided via an air-permeable membrane located in the back of the vessel (not visible). Panel B: The two orientations of the RWV for experimental set up. For RWV experiments, two separate apparatuses are used that are set up in two different orientations using the same culture inoculation. In the control orientation, the low fluid shear environment is abolished and increased fluid shear levels are present. The only difference in the two cultures is the orientation of each vessel. Panel C: A diagram of the orbital path of a representative cell in the LSMMG orientation of the RWV to demonstrate the nature of the low fluid shear cell suspension. This is achieved in large part by the solid body rotation of the media in the apparatus in such a way that sedimentation is offset to allow suspension with a minimum of fluid shear forces. Previous experimental results in the literature point to a possible relationship between trp genes and the LSMMG/ spaceflight response in bacteria. In S. Typhimurium , the trpD gene was one of the few genes in a group found to be up-regulated by all low-shear/microgravity conditions tested including LSMMG in LB media [5] and by spaceflight in both LB and M9 media [3, 7], and this result was observed using both microarray and qPCR analysis [3, 5, 7]. In addition, a study with adherent-invasive E. coli showed that a mutation in a tryptophan permease gene decreased LSMMG-induced adherence to tissue culture cells, and this phenotype was complemented by restoring the WT gene or by exogenous indole supplementation [28]. These results, combined with new observations in this report, provided significant justification for analyzing the role of trp genes in the conservation of the LSMMG response. Overall, our results indicate that the LSMMG response is conserved across Enterobacteriaceae but with potential variation in the “direction” of regulation of a given phenotype, and that associated trp genes are not involved in this conservation under the conditions tested here.MATERIALS AND METHODS Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) Cultures Cultures were grown in the RWV in LB (Lennox) broth as previously described [3, 4, 7]. Experimental set-up with RWV cultures is depicted in Fig. (1). The RWV apparatus used was model RCCS-1 from Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX as used in previous studies [3, 4, 7]. Strains used in this study were as follows: S. Typhimurium χ3339 [29], E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), E. coli MG1655 [30], E. coli DH5a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), E. coli AS11 [31], E. cloacae ATCC23355 [32], C. freundii ATCC8090 [32], and S. marcescens ATCC14041 [33]. Stress Assays and qPCR Acid and oxidative stress assays were performed as previously described [3, 4, 7]. The qPCR reactions were performed as previously described using 16S rRNA and lpxC genes for normalization [3, 34]. DNA oligonucleotides used as primers in qPCR are provided in Table 1. Table 1.

Typhimurium and E. coli and confirmed using both PCR and phenotypic indications [35]. DNA oligonucleotides used in the recombineering are provided in Table 1. Briefly, PCR products were amplified from the template plasmid pKD3 using primers containing 40-bp regions of homology to the ends of the trpR and trpDE genes such that deletion of the genes would be obtained. Strains containing plasmid pKD46 were electroporated with the PCR products, and colonies were selected on LB-Cm medium.RESULTS RWV Growth Kinetics To determine if the individual members of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar growth kinetics in both LSMMG and control conditions (an important parameter for comparing the two culture orientations with a given species), we grew the following members of this family in the RWV in the LSMMG and control orientations (Fig. 2): S. Typhimurium , E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens. Data obtained with S. Typhimurium have previously shown that growth in LSMMG and control conditions results in very similar kinetic profiles for this organism in LB medium [1, 4, 7]. Analysis of bacterial growth in the LSMMG and control conditions for E. coli, E. cloacae, C. freundii, and S. marcescens revealed essentially identical kinetics in both environments for each organism (Fig. 2). This assures that phenotypic assays performed at a given point in the growth of LSMMG and control cultures are using cells at equivalent growth phases. Fig. (2). Open in a new tab Growth of Enterobacteriaceae in the RWV. Panel A: A representative growth curve for Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter cloacae ATCC23355) in the RWV for the LSMMG and control conditions in LB media, 37 °C. The RWV apparatuses were set-up and operated as shown in Fig. (1) and as previously described [1, 3-5, 7]. At the indicated time points, aliquots were removed from the indicated apparatuses, serial-diluted, and plated for CFU/ml counts in triplicate. This experiment was also performed for Escherichia coli TOP10, Citrobacter freudii ATCC8090, and Serratia marcsescens ATCC14041 with equivalent results (data shown in panel B below). Panel B: Cultures of the indicated bacteria were grown in the RWV in the LSMMG and control conditions in LB media and samples processed as in panel A. For each time point, the ratio of CFU/ml LSMMG to control was calculated. The results were obtained from at least two independent cultures for each strain, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. For E. coli, the data shown here is for strain TOP10. Strains E. coli MG1655, E. coli DH5 α, and E. coli AS11 displayed results equivalent to those presented here (data not shown). Acid and Oxidative Stress Phenotypes Previous studies have demonstrated that resistance to acid and oxidative stress is altered by LSMMG in S. Typhimurium [1-5, 7, 33]. Therefore, we tested each genus (including S. Typhimurium ) for these phenotypes by comparing LSMMG and control cultures for resistance to acid stress (pH=3.5, citric acid) and oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, 35 - 70 mM) (Figs. 3 and 4). It is worth noting that acid stress resistance was tested using the conditions reported in the Wilson, et al. (2007) and Wilson, et al. (2008) references in which resistance is decreased by LSMMG in S. Typhimurium for cultures grown 24 hours which more appropriately matched spaceflight conditions involved in those studies [3, 7]. Fig. (3). Open in a new tab LSMMG-mediated alteration of acid stress resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. The indicated strains were grown in the RWV in the LSMMG and control conditions for testing of acid stress resistance (pH=3.5, citric acid, 2 hours stress exposure) as previously described [3, 7]. To test survival of the stress in the LSMMG and control samples, aliquots from each sample were removed from the stress, serially-diluted in PBS, and plated for CFU counts on LB media. The percent survival of the bacteria compared to the number present at t=0 before addition of the stress was determined for each sample, and then a ratio of percent survival values was calculated and plotted as indicated in the graph (either control/control or LSMMG/control). The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05. Fig. (4). Open in a new tab Oxidative stress resistance altered by LSMMG in Enterobacteriaceae. RWV cultures of the indicated strains were tested for oxidative stress resistance (hydrogen peroxide, 35 - 70 mM, 2 hours stress exposure) as described in Fig. (3) and as previously described [4, 33] The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05. For S. Typhimurium , acid stress resistance was decreased in LSMMG as reported previously (Fig. 3) [3, 7]. However, under the same conditions, resistance to acid stress was increased by LSMMG for E. coli, and this result was repeated in four different E. coli strains to ensure that strain differences did not explain the deviation from the S. Typhimurium phenotype (Fig. 3). In E. cloacae and S. marcescens, LSMMG decreased and increased acid stress resistance, respectively (Fig. 3). For C. freundii, acid stress resistance was not significantly different between LSMMG and control cultures (Fig. 3). For oxidative stress resistance, LSMMG decreased resistance for all tested genera (Fig. 4). These results are equivalent to previously published data for S. Typhimurium [4, 33]. For S. marcescens, oxidative stress resistance could not be tested due to the fact that this organism could not be killed by the levels of hydrogen peroxide we tested for this study (up to 175 mM for this organism).qPCR Assays To test for changes in gene expression induced by LSMMG in different genera, we isolated total RNA from S. Typhimurium , E. coli, E. cloacae, and C. freundii cultures grown at LSMMG and control conditions and analyzed gene expression using qRT-PCR [3, 18]. In S. Typhimurium , the expression of the hfq and trpD genes was decreased and increased, respectively, by LSMMG (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with previously published data which identified altered expression of these genes by LSMMG using microarray analysis and qPCR [3, 5, 7]. In E. coli, LSMMG decreased the expression of both genes indicating that LSMMG altered gene expression in this genus, but that the direction of trpD regulation was reversed compared to S. Typhimurium (Fig. 5). This is interesting given the fact that the direction of LSMMG-induced acid resistance alteration was also reversed accordingly in these two genera (Fig. 3). In C. freundii, hfq expression was also decreased by LSMMG, but trpD expression was not significantly altered (Fig. 5). As in E. coli, the trpD result also correlates to the acid resistance phenotype in C. freundii where LSMMG did not cause altered resistance to this stress. In E. cloacae, we did not observe alteration of hfq expression by LSMMG but did observe an increase in expression of the ydcI gene by LSMMG (Fig. 5). The ydcI result is consistent with previously reported data which identified this gene as LSMMG-regulated in S. Typhimurium [4, 5]. Overall, qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that a molecular response to LSMMG resulting in gene expression changes is conserved across Enterobactericeae, but the direction of gene expression change (i.e. up or down) can potentially vary depending on genus. Fig. (5). Open in a new tab qRT-PCR analysis to determine LSMMG-induced alterations of gene expression in Enterobacteriaceae. Total RNA harvested from LSMMG and control cultures was converted to single-stranded cDNA and used as template in qPCR analysis with primers hybridizing to the indicated genes as described previously [3, 18]. PCR product levels were normalized to both the 16S rRNA and lpxC genes [3, 34], and a ratio of each gene level for LSMMG to control was calculated to give a fold-difference in expression between the two samples as previously described [3]. Differences in expression between LSMMG and control samples were significant at p-value < 0.05. The data was obtained from at least four qPCR reactions using RNA from at least two independent cultures for each condition, and the data is plotted as the average and standard deviation. Analysis of Role of trp Genes In the experiments above, we observed an inverse correlation between the direction of change in acid resistance by LSMMG and the direction of regulation of trpD expression by LSMMG in S. Typhimurium and E. coli (Figs. 3, 5). In addition,we observed that in C. freundii, these phenotypes correlated to eachother in that LSMMG did not induce alteration of acid stress or trpD expression in this species (Figs. 3, 5). This observation is curious since the trp genes are not involved in acid resistance, and the activity of the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by the trp operon is not involved in environmental stress resistance. However,in S. Typhimurium , the trpD gene was one of the few genes in a group found to be up-regulated by all low-shear/micro-gravity conditions tested including LSMMG in LB media [5] and by spaceflight in both LB and M9 media [3, 7], and this result was observed using both microarray and qPCR analysis [3, 5, 7]. In addition, a study with adherent-invasive E. coli showed that a mutation in a tryptophan permease gene altered an LSMMG-induced phenotype related to cell adherence, and this alteration was complemented by restoring the WT gene or by exogenous indole supplementation [28]. Taken together, the above observations provided justification to analyze the role of trp genes in the LSMMG response.We reasoned that the changes in trpD expression under LSMMG could be related to a regulatory mechanism acting up-stream of the trp operon that is responsive to and/or involved in the LSMMG response pathway. The TrpR protein is a transcriptional regulator that controls expression of the trp operon as well as several other genes distributed across the S. Typhimurium and E. coli genomes [36]. Since this protein regulates a global gene regulon, we viewed TrpR as a possible candidate regulatory mechanism through which the LSMMG response acts in bacteria. We therefore constructed ΔtrpR mutations in S. Typhimurium and E. coli, and we tested these mutants for display of LSMMG phenotypes (Fig. 6). We found that the deletion of TrpR had no effect on the acid and oxidative stress LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that TrpR is likely not involved in the LSMMG response under the conditions tested here (Fig. 6). In addition, we also considered the possibility that the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by the trp operon could be having a role in the LSMMG response. Therefore, we constructed a ΔtrpDE mutation in S. Typhimurium and E. coli that knocked out expression of this enzyme, and we tested these mutants for LSMMG phenotypes compared to WT (Fig. 6). As with the ΔtrpR strains, we observed no effect of ΔtrpDE on LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that the trp operon genes are not involved the LSMMG response as tested here. Fig. (6). Open in a new tab Analysis of role of trp genes in LSMMG phenotypes. S. Typhimurium and E.coli Δ trpR and Δ trpDE strains were compared to respective WT strains for LSMMG-mediated alteration of acid and oxidative stress as described in Figs. (3, 4). The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05. DISCUSSION The results presented here provide significant evidence using several strains and multiple assays that the response to the LSMMG growth environment is conserved across Enterobacteriaceae.Thus, the pathways and mechanisms used for sensing this environmental signal appear to be present in these different cells. This report also demonstrates that in a “side-by-side” study, the direction of LSMMG-induced regulation of phenotypes and gene expression can vary depending on genus. These results indicate that applications using the LSMMG environment (and related spaceflight conditions) have the potential to be targeted to a range of Entrobacteriaceae genera. Future work will focus on understanding the underlying causes of the variance in the direction of LSMMG regulation observed here and on the use of LSMMG/spaceflight to engineer bacteria in different ways.

    "abstract": "Abstract Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations.

No currently available in vitro or in vivo model system is able to completely mimic the P. aeruginosa disease phenotype. Accordingly, the complexity of the host, pathogen and host-pathogen interactions has necessitated a combined use of different model systems to advance our understanding of P. aeruginosa infectious disease. P. aeruginosa is most commonly studied in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where chronic lung inflammation caused by this microorganism is believed to be the major source of mortality (Yang, et al., 2011, Doring, et al., 2012). In the thick, viscous CF lung mucus, P. aeruginosa primarily exists as persistent alginate-overproducing (mucoid) biofilms that adhere to mucus compounds, but not to lung epithelium, and are resistant to available antimicrobial agents and the host immune system (Hoiby, et al., 2010, Schobert & Tielen, 2010, Breidenstein, et al., 2011). P. aeruginosa-associated components (such as LPS, lectins, alginate) and secreted factors (such as quorum sensing molecules and pyocyanin) generate an extreme inflammatory response, which is destructive for the host but not the pathogen (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). Furthermore, acute P. aeruginosa infections frequently occur in patient populations with a damaged epithelial barrier (such as in burn wound patients, following intestinal surgery, at insertion sites of catheters or endotracheal tubes, or in scratched cornea), or compromised immune system (such as HIV and cancer patients) (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). During acute infections, disease or injury-related epithelial modifications that mediate P. aeruginosa adhesion are believed to contribute to the infectious disease process, thereby necessitating direct host-pathogen interactions (Engel & Eran, 2011). Herewith, the type three secretion system (T3SS) (Lee, et al., 2005), various adhesins (such as lectins, flagella and type IV pili) and secreted virulence factors dictate the course of disease (Engel & Eran, 2011). In vitro cell and tissue culture models have served as useful platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms and phenotypic properties from both the host and pathogen side that underly the infectious disease process. While many in vitro models are oversimplistic and lack key properties of the parental tissue, increasing efforts are made to design more physiologically relevant models, and to explore their potential for P. aeruginosa pathogenesis studies. At the other extreme are animal models, which have advanced our knowledge on various P. aeruginosa-induced illnesses, but often do not mimic human physiology and disease, are complex and require extensive expertise. Since many in vitro findings have been confirmed using animal models (Pier, et al., 1996, Martin, et al., Bucior, et al., 2013, Cory, et al., 2013), it is relevant to utilize in vitro model systems to initially explore fundamental questions and to verify select findings in vivo. This approach can significantly refine and reduce the use of animal models. Finally, with promising ongoing projects, such as Donald Ingber’s human-on-a-chip (Marx, et al., 2012), complex multi-organ systems might one day be engineered which could accomplish the third “R”, replacement of animal models. The host microenvironment affects virulence properties of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, mimicking the host microenvironment is essential for the development of in vitro infection models that better mimic in vivo phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, which will facilitate the design of novel efficacious antimicrobial treatments. In this review, we highlight that the choice of the model system, and the host characteristics that it mimics, can significantly impact the P. aeruginosa phenotype and outcome of the infection study. For detailed information about the immunomodulatory, cytotoxic and detrimental effects that P. aeruginosa and its virulence factors exert on the host during acute and chronic infections, we refer readers to excellent reviews (Sadikot, et al., 2005, Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). This review describes in vitro model systems of mucosal tissues with increasing complexity that reconcile key characteristics of the host involved in the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process. However, before discussing these models and the in vivo traits that they mimic, we start by providing a concise overview of host factors that affect P. aeruginosa disease initiation and progression, regardless of whether they are modified by P. aeruginosa upon host encounter. Given that most P. aeruginosa infections are located in mucosal tissues, we focus on this infection site, with particular emphasis on the lung.",

In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient’s bedside.Introduction As a leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been extensively studied over the past 35 years.

For detailed information about the immunomodulatory, cytotoxic and detrimental effects that P. aeruginosa and its virulence factors exert on the host during acute and chronic infections, we refer readers to excellent reviews (Sadikot, et al., 2005, Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). This review describes in vitro model systems of mucosal tissues with increasing complexity that reconcile key characteristics of the host involved in the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process. However, before discussing these models and the in vivo traits that they mimic, we start by providing a concise overview of host factors that affect P. aeruginosa disease initiation and progression, regardless of whether they are modified by P. aeruginosa upon host encounter. Given that most P. aeruginosa infections are located in mucosal tissues, we focus on this infection site, with particular emphasis on the lung.How does the mucosal epithelium contribute to P. aeruginosa virulence? The healthy mucosal epithelium is protected from P. aeruginosa The first line of defense against mucosal pathogens like P. aeruginosa relies on physical, chemical and cellular factors. Key host factors that protect the lung from P. aeruginosa infection and are altered during disease are depicted in Figure 1. While additional host factors are altered during disease, due to space limitations, only those that have a well-documented effect on P. aeruginosa lung pathogenesis are presented. Physical factors include sealing of the epithelial paracellular pathway by tight junctions, subjacent adherens junctions, and desmosomes (Marchiando, et al., 2010). In addition, the mucociliary escalator (with associated fluid shear levels (Blake, 1973, Tarran, et al., 2005)) in the mucous lining of the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles captures and subsequently clears more than 90% of inhaled particles (Quinton, 2010). Specifically, the biphasic mucus layer covering the airway epithelium enables continuous beating of epithelium-associated cilia, which moves the upper mucus layer towards the laryngopharynx. Besides the binding of P. aeruginosa to mucus components and subsequent removal, mucus contains antimicrobial substances, such as β-defensins and lactoferrins, which are part of the chemical factors that keep our lungs and other mucosal surfaces clear of infection by this microorganism (Venkatakrishnan, et al., 2013). Furthermore, chemical factors such as normoxia, low iron levels, neutral pH, bicarbonate and phosphate levels, all contribute to keeping P. aeruginosa to a manageable phenotype (Zaborina, et al., 2007, Long, et al., 2008, Romanowski, et al., 2011, Zaborin, et al., 2012, Babrowski, et al., 2013, Cornelis & Dingemans, 2013), that can easily be cleared by the innate immune system. In addition to the basal level of innate immune cells such as macrophages present in healthy mucosal tissues, epithelial cells play a key role in the direct defense against P. aeruginosa and in the controlled recruitment of neutrophils for effective eradication of this microorganism. The cellular receptor CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) has been shown to bind P. aeruginosa in the healthy host, which results in bacterial internalization, apoptosis/exfoliation of the infected cell, and recruitment of phagocytes (reviewed in (Pier, 2012)). On the other hand, additional host receptors that bind P. aeruginosa and mediate invasion, such as asialo ganglioside M1 (asialoGM1), and α5β1 integrins, are expressed at basal levels on the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells (de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999). In healthy mucosal epithelium, the basolateral surface is not exposed, which prevents binding to basolateral cell membrane receptors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999, Bucior, et al., 2010). Furthermore, epithelial cells can produce enzymatic factors, such as paraoxonases that degrade P. aeruginosa quorum sensing molecules (Chun, et al., 2004, Ozer, et al., 2005). Finally, the indigenous microbiota of mucosal tissues such as lung and intestine plays an essential role in host defense against P. aeruginosa, through competition for nutrients, activation of innate immune cells and epithelial cell differentiation (including tight junctions) (Han, et al., 2012, Lozupone, et al., 2012, Eloe-Fadrosh & Rasko, 2013, Guzman, et al., 2013). Collectively, these physical, chemical and cellular factors of mucosal tissues protect the healthy host from P. aeruginosa infections. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The lung mucosal tissue in a healthy person (A), a patient with damaged epithelium (e.g., bronchoscopy, cathether, and surgery) (B), and a cystic fibrosis patient (C). Key factors that protect a healthy host against P. aeruginosa infection (A) or that contribute to P. aeruginosa initiation of infectious disease (B and C) are depicted. While additional host factors are altered during disease, only those that have a well-documented effect on P. aeruginosa pathogenesis are presented. In addition, host factors that are changed due to infection by P. aeruginosa are not included or discussed.The injured mucosal epithelium mediates P. aeruginosa infection Epithelial injury in patients undergoing bronchoscopy, intestinal surgery, or other damaging procedures, renders them particularly susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection (Figure 1, Table 1). First, disruption of tight junctions as part of the physical barrier enables paracellular migration to basolateral receptors, which is the preferred infection site for this opportunistic pathogen (Fleiszig, et al., 1997, Kube, et al., 2005). In addition, binding to ECM proteins of the basement membrane, such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagens, is part of P. aeruginosa colonization and tissue invasion when the epithelial barrier is damaged (Trafny, et al., 1995, de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Plotkowski, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999). Since repairing epithelial cells are not ciliated (Dupuit, et al., 1995, Puchelle, et al., 2006), local disruption in mucociliary clearance could further contribute to enhanced P. aeruginosa adhesion and ultimately dissemination. Changes in the microenvironment following intestinal surgery have been found to increase virulence characteristics in P. aeruginosa. Specifically, host chemical factors altered during stress, such as release of opioids, low phosphate levels or higher pH trigger a lethal phenotype in P. aeruginosa (Zaborina, et al., 2007, Long, et al., 2008, Romanowski, et al., 2011, Zaborin, et al., 2012, Babrowski, et al., 2013). Moreover, the monosaccharide content of breastmilk versus formula was found to affect P. aeruginosa virulence gene expression, which could be correlated with the development of neonatal necrotic enterocolitis depending on the infant’s diet (Nelson, et al., 2013). Hypoxia following stress in intestinal or other mucosal tissues also profoundly affects virulence traits in P. aeruginosa, including the expression of the adhesin PA-I lectin and enhanced binding via exposure of basolateral membranes (Fleiszig, et al., 1997, Kohler, et al., 2005). Finally, the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), produced by the inflamed tissues, has been shown to bind the outer membrane protein OprF of P. aeruginosa, which induces PA-I lectin expression (Wu, et al., 2005). Cellular factors are also believed to contribute to the susceptibility of damaged and repairing epithelium upon P. aeruginosa encounter. Specifically, basolateral membrane receptors that bind P. aeruginosa (e.g., heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans) are enriched at the apical side of repairing mucosal tissue (Bucior, et al., 2010), and apical receptors/binding sites such as asialoGM1, fibronectin and the integrin α5β1 are transiently enriched at the surface of spreading and repairing respiratory epithelial cells (de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999). Finally, repairing epithelium does not express apical CFTR (Puchelle, et al., 2006), which could impede effective clearance of infected epithelial cells. Table 1.

While ΔF508-CFTR airway epithelial cells have a decreased barrier function (Bebok, et al., 2005, Kube, et al., 2005, LeSimple, et al., 2010), this phenotypic characteristic is not believed to contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa infection. However, the primary physical barrier component that is causative for chronic infections in the CF lung environment is the absent mucociliary clearance, predominantly due to CFTR-mediated imbalances in bicarbonate levels (Quinton, 2010, Pier, 2012). The resulting dehydrated mucus layer comprised of compact sticky mucins has been shown to cause many of the CF-related phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, including loss of motility, mucus-associated biofilm formation, anaerobic metabolism, and resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (Sriramulu, et al., 2005, Matsui, et al., 2006, Fung, et al., 2010). Further, lower fluid shear levels that could be present in the CF lung as a consequence of the impacted mucociliary escalator were also found to generate a CF-like P. aeruginosa phenotype, including self-aggregative biofilms, enhanced alginate production, microaerophilic/anaerobic metabolism, and resistance to oxidative stress (Crabbé, et al., 2008, Crabbé, et al., 2010). The chemical microenvironment of the CF lung also significantly contributes to P. aeruginosa virulence and persistence. Indeed, the microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions in the CF lung trigger antibiotic resistance, alginate production, and biofilm formation (Worlitzsch, et al., 2002, Hassett, et al., 2009, Schobert & Jahn, 2010, Schobert & Tielen, 2010). Furthermore, high iron levels, specific amino acids, and lower pH have all been related to P. aeruginosa virulence in the CF lung mucus (Palmer, et al., 2007, Pezzulo, et al., 2012, Cornelis & Dingemans, 2013). The CF lung environment is also characterized by high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mostly produced by the influx of neutrophils, which has been shown to induce the characteristic mucoid phenotype of P. aeruginosa (Mathee, et al., 1999). Finally, high protease levels in the CF lung, particularly neutrophil elastase, can degrade host antimicrobial peptides such as defensins and LL-37, which further impedes clearance of P. aeruginosa (Weiner, et al., 2003, Zhang, et al., 2005, Forde, et al., 2014). The microbiome is becoming increasingly recognized as a major cellular component of the CF lung that contributes to P. aeruginosa virulence. Dozens of bacterial taxa (including Prevotella, Veillonella spp.), of which many are oropharyngeal flora, inhabit CF lung mucus (Han, et al., 2012). Decreased community diversity is related to more severe lung disease, and the community dynamics depend on CFTR genotype (Cox, et al., 2010). It has been shown that microbial community members in the CF lung, including from the oropharyngeal flora, increase virulence characteristics of P. aeruginosa and could contribute to lung disease (Duan, et al., 2003, Venkataraman, et al., 2014). Since host microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to be key in the initial survival, persistence, and ultimately adaptation of P. aeruginosa in the lung (Yang, et al., 2011, Folkesson, et al., 2012), mimicking the host and the microenvironment is essential when studying the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process. In this review, we mainly focus on the lung mucosa environment.Which in vitro cell culture models are used to study P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mucosal tissues? Two-dimensional monolayers An overview of in vitro models of human lung mucosa used to study P. aeruginosa pathogenesis is presented in Table 2. The P. aeruginosa infectious disease process is most frequently studied using a single cell type grown on a non-permeable surface (plastic or glass), referred to as two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers. Two-dimensional monolayers of different cell lines have been used for study of lung disease (A549, 16HBE, CFBE) and intestinal disease (HeLa, T84, CaCo2, HT-29) by P. aeruginosa (Saiman, et al., 1990, Pier, et al., 1996, McNamara, et al., 2001, Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2008, Schaible, et al., 2013, Wang, et al., 2013, Weichert, et al., 2013). In addition, primary cells recovered from nasal brushing of human volunteers, human lung biopsies, human nasal polyps and mouse lung grown as 2-D monolayers have been used (Amitani, et al., 1991, Plotkowski, et al., 1991, Bajolet-Laudinat, et al., 1994, de Courcey, et al., 2012). There are several advantages of using 2-D monolayers as models for infection studies, including that they are (i) cost effective, (ii) require limited equipment and materials, (iii) easy to set-up, maintain, monitor and manipulate, (iv) quickly ready for downstream assays (e.g., confluence is reached in 3–4 days for A549 cell line), and (v) high-throughput (e.g., multi-well assays). When 2-D monolayers of cell lines are used, a well-characterized homogeneous cell population is usually obtained, which results in high experimental reproducibility. On the other hand, 2-D monolayers often lack differentiation characteristics of the in vivo parental tissue, including 3-D architecture, phenotypic characteristics, multicellular complexity, and function. Specifically, most cell lines or primary cells grown as traditional monolayers on impermeable surfaces are not polarized, and thus do not express distinctive apical and basolateral markers (including surface receptors), which are important in studying aspects of the P. aeruginosa infection process that require cell polarity, including adhesion (Carterson, et al., 2005, Engel & Eran, 2011). Therefore, 2-D monolayers are limited in predicting the host response to disease and drug effectiveness. An additional limitation of 2-D monolayers is that cells easily detach from their substrate upon infection, and thus long-term studies are limited using this model system (Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2008).

In this model system, cells grown on the surface of ECM-coated (mostly collagen) semi-permeable membranes are submerged in culture medium both at their apical and basolateral sides (Villenave, et al., 2013). For respiratory mucosa, an air-liquid interface (ALI) can be generated upon reaching confluency (evaluated by Trans Epithelial Resistance (TER) measurement) for further maturation by removing medium at the apical cell surface. Primary airway epithelial cells grown as ALI are one of the best characterized model systems of the lung and closely mimic key aspects of the in vivo architecture, cellular composition and physiology of airway epithelium. Specifically, ALI of primary airway cells are pseudostratified, contain a highly differentiated mixed epithelial cell population (including basal, ciliated, and goblet cells), express relevant cilia coverage and beating, mucus production, polarity and tight junctions (Plotkowski, et al., 1999, Zulianello, et al., 2006, Villenave, et al., 2013). While the overall morphology of ALI strikingly resembles the in vivo tissue, differences in the proportion of the lung epithelial cells have been reported compared to the native organ (Dvorak, et al., 2011, Villenave, et al., 2012). However, the in vivo-like characteristics (such as polarity and CFTR expression) of epithelial cells grown on permeable supports strongly depend on the cell source used (Table 2). Limitations of Transwell model systems include that they are expensive, time-consuming (regarding manipulations and duration of maturation – e.g., 3–4 weeks for primary airway epithelial cells) and have limited high-throughput capabilities. Interestingly, permeable supports are amenable to co-culturing multiple cell types in a physiologically relevant manner, including innate immune cells (Higbee, et al., 2009, Leonard, et al., 2010, Lehmann, et al., 2011), and inclusion of biomechanical forces (such as air pressure, viscoelastic stretch force and fluid shear) (Swartz, et al., 2001, Huh, et al., 2010).Three-dimensional cell culture models Three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models that have been explored for P. aeruginosa infection studies include (i) 3-D models generated using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (Barrila, et al., 2010), and (ii) 3-D cell spheroids generated through gentle agitation (Worlitzsch, et al., 2002, Ulrich & Doring, 2004, Ulrich, et al., 2005). The RWV is an optimized form of suspension culture in which cells are typically grown on the surface of porous ECM-coated microcarrier beads under low fluid shear and gentle mixing conditions. The dynamic culture conditions in the RWV enable cells to differentiate into well-organized 3-D tissue-like structures (termed 3-D aggregates), which replicate many of the in vivo characteristics including apical-basolateral polarity, a single cell layer for lung and intestinal tissues, tight junctions, mucus production, and differentiation into several epithelial cell types (Barrila, et al., 2010). These models are amenable to most infectious disease-related assays, with the exception of transcytosis, enable co-culturing of multiple cell types, offer targeted high-throughput analysis and exhibit key in vivo-like responses to pathogens, their toxins, and antimicrobial therapeutics not observed with conventional cell culture models (Barrila, et al., 2010, Crabbé, et al., 2011, Radtke, et al., 2011). Disadvantages are that these models are more expensive, labor-intensive, require relatively long incubation times (e.g. 9–12 days for 3-D A549 model) compared to 2-D monolayers, and are currently not amenable to chronic infection studies. Another 3-D lung epithelial model is generated through incubation of primary airway epithelial cells under gentle agitation (Worlitzsch, et al., 2002, Ulrich & Doring, 2004, Ulrich, et al., 2005). As a result, cells naturally aggregate and generate sphere-shaped clumps (spheroids) that contain a mixed cell population, including ciliated and mucus-secreting goblet cells. A major advantage of this 3-D cell culture model is its long-term viability and differentiated state (6 months when derived from nasal polyps and 6 weeks when derived from lung tissue). In addition, this model is easy to generate, inexpensive and could allow targeted high-throughput studies. Downsides include the long culture time (4 weeks) and the questionable physiological relevance, with regard to in vivo-like architecture and polarity. In vitro organ cultures Earlier studies have used small intact pieces (about 3 mm2, 2–3 mm thick) of human or animal tissue to study P. aeruginosa infection. For lung studies, in vitro organ cultures (IVOCs) were generated from adenoids (from adenoid hypertrophy patients) (Tsang, et al., 1994), nasal polyps (Bajolet-Laudinat, et al., 1994), human nasal turbinate tissue, non-transplanted lung tissue from transplant recipients (Dowling, et al., 1997, Dowling, et al., 1997, Dowling, et al., 1999, Sajjan, et al., 2004), or from dissected mouse tissue (Bucior, et al., 2013). Advantages of this model system are that it enables research in physiologically relevant human/animal tissue that maintains the in vivo structure and integrity. IVOCs closely approximate the in vivo ratio of differentiated lung cell types (including leucocytes) that interact with the native ECM and submucosal tissues in a physiological 3-D environment (Middleton, et al., 2003, Sajjan, et al., 2004). Moreover, these models secrete mucus and maintain epithelial integrity for 10 and 20 days, respectively (Jackson, et al., 1996, Boat, et al., 1997). Disadvantages include the low availability of human tissue biopsies, limited life span of cell types within the tissues (such as leucocytes) (Farley, et al., 1986, Forsgren, et al., 1994), and biological variation. In addition, this model requires specific expertise and is time-consuming. For P. aeruginosa infection studies specifically, exfoliation of epithelial cells is already observed after 4h of infection, which limits the usefulness of this model for long-term studies (Plotkowski, et al., 1989). Of note, in a similar manner as for Transwells, IVOCs can be grown at an air-liquid interface (Sajjan, et al., 2004), which more closely simulates the conditions encountered by the respiratory mucosa in vivo, and can result in significant differences in the infectious disease outcome compared to submersion of the apical surface in medium (Middleton, et al., 2003).Other cell culture models with potential for P. aeruginosa pathogenesis In this section, we briefly address other cell culture models that have, to our knowledge, not yet been utilized for studying P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in mucosal tissues, but could be of interest. Mucosal cell culture models with in vivo-like 3-D architecture, polarity and other physiological traits are commonly generated by growing cells in a 3-D matrix scaffold comprised of single or multiple ECMs, termed hydrogels, that mimic the lamina propria (Kleinman & Martin, 2005, Inman & Bissell, 2010, Zhang, et al., 2011). Since bacteria will encounter the hydrogel first, followed by the basolateral cell surface, this model is relevant when studying basolateral P. aeruginosa infections (Alarcon, et al., 2009, Bucior, et al., 2010). For mucosal tissues (where pathogens infect at the apical side), the infection process might not be physiologically relevant (Barrila, et al., 2010). Acellular (or decellularized) scaffolds generated from animal or human tissues have recently emerged that mimic the complex 3-D architecture and ECM composition of their parental counterpart (reviewed by (Wagner, et al., 2013)). Exponential progress has been made over the past years to improve tissue decellularization and repopulation with different cell types (Cortiella, et al., 2010, Ott, et al., 2010, Daly, et al., 2012, Petersen, et al., 2012, Crabbé, et al., 2014, Mendez, et al., 2014, Wagner, et al., 2014). However, complete recellularization of the lung surface with differentiated functional lung epithelium (and establishment of barrier function) has to precede the usefulness of these models for infectious disease research purposes. In the future, model systems generated from decellularized scaffolds might offer attractive platforms to study infectious diseases, given the enhanced 3-D architectural complexity compared to currently available models and the possibility to include biomechanical forces, such as breathing movement. The recently developed organ-on-a-chip model simulates key characteristics of the host microenvironment, including biomechanical forces (fluid shear and viscoelastic stretch), 3-D organization of distinct tissues (e.g. interfaces between epithelium and vascular endothelium), and biochemical properties (Huh, et al., 2011). For example, the lung-on-a-chip model reconstitutes the surfactant-producing alveolar-capillary interface on a collagen-coated porous silicon wafer, and mimics the cyclic biomechanical stretch force of breathing and vascular perfusion (Huh, et al., 2010). Neutrophil transmigration in response to apical exposure with Escherichia coli was demonstrated, indicating the usefulness of this system to mimic the innate cellular response to bacterial infection (Huh, et al., 2010). Therefore, the organ-on-a-chip model holds tremendous potential for further unraveling of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis mechanisms.Which physiological characteristics of mucosal tissue models affect the study of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis? Apical and basolateral polarity Receptors and other host-associated factors differentially expressed at apical and basolateral surfaces are important for the clearance of P. aeruginosa in the healthy host, and for colonization of damaged epithelium (reviewed in (Engel & Eran, 2011, Pier, 2012)). Therefore, mucosal cell culture models that replicate epithelial cell polarity of the host tissue in health and disease are essential to assess host and pathogen responses to infection (Engel & Eran, 2011, Srikanth, et al., 2011, Law, et al., 2013). When studying resistance of the healthy host to P. aeruginosa infection, it is relevant to mimic the in vivo-like cell polarity (Engel & Eran, 2011). On the other hand, it is key to replicate the affected polarity of damaged epithelium when studying P. aeruginosa in the context of acute infections (Fleiszig, et al., 1998, Plotkowski, et al., 1999, Kazmierczak, et al., 2004). When the basolateral epithelial cell surface is accessible in the context of damaged epithelium, it is the preferred site for P. aeruginosa binding (Bucior, et al., 2010, Bucior, et al., 2012). Since basolateral receptors are enriched at the apical side of repairing (incompletely polarized) epithelium, P. aeruginosa adhesion, invasion, and cytotoxicity is enhanced compared to polarized epithelium (Heiniger, et al., 2010) (Fleiszig, et al., 1998, Kazmierczak, et al., 2004). Interestingly, P. aeruginosa (both planktonic cells and aggregates) can enhance the expression of basolateral receptors at the apical surface to facilitate its uptake through activation of host signaling pathways (Kierbel, et al., 2005, Gassama-Diagne, et al., 2006, Kierbel, et al., 2007, Lepanto, et al., 2011, Bucior, et al., 2012). In addition, putative P. aeruginosa receptors such as apical asialo ganglioside M1 (asialoGM1), and the integrin α5β1 are transiently enriched at the surface of spreading and repairing respiratory epithelial cells (de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999), even though the role of asialoGM1 in P. aeruginosa binding is controversial (Schroeder, et al., 2001). Furthermore, apical expression of N-glycoproteins depends on the differentiation/polarization status of epithelial cells, and affects type IV pili-mediated binding, invasion and cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa (Bucior, et al., 2010, Bucior, et al., 2012). Therefore, binding of P. aeruginosa to apical surfaces can be inhibited by competitive blockage of exogenous sugars (Bucior, et al., 2013). To further validate the role of cell polarity during P. aeruginosa infections, adhesion and invasion of this bacterium was significantly reduced in a polarized 3-D A549 lung model compared to non-polarized 2-D A549 monolayers (Carterson, et al., 2005). Differential colonization of polarized and non-polarized epithelium is also observed for other mucosal pathogens (such as Salmonella) (Barrila, et al., 2010, Law, et al., 2013). A host cell receptor that could be implicated in the clearance of P. aeruginosa from the healthy host is CFTR (Pier, et al., 1996, Pier, et al., 1996), even though controversies exist (Plotkowski, et al., 1999). Specifically, CFTR binds the outer LPS core of non-mucoid P. aeruginosa and initiates a swift, coordinated inflammatory response (through NF-κB) that results in pathogen removal via recruitment of innate immune cells (in vivo) and apoptosis of the infected cells (in vitro) (Schroeder, et al., 2002). When studying the role of CFTR in P. aeruginosa colonization, it is important to consider that CFTR trafficking, apical expression and functionality depends on cell polarity for many cell lines (e.g., HT-29, 16 HBE) (Morris, et al., 1994, Plotkowski, et al., 1999, Loffing-Cueni, et al., 2001). Indeed, wild type bronchial epithelial cells grown as non-polarized 2-D monolayers express low levels of CFTR (Pier, et al., 1997), and the functionality of CFTR has been shown to improve when cells are grown as ALI (Bebok, et al., 2001). Taken together, the loss of polarity in repairing epithelium facilitates P. aeruginosa colonization compared to intact epithelium, presumably through increased expression of apical receptors, enhanced binding to basolateral receptors, and absence of a functional CFTR. While these studies are relevant for acute infections involving damaged epithelium, they highlight that tissue culture models of improperly polarized epithelium can result in an artificially different susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection (Carterson, et al., 2005, Heiniger, et al., 2010).Junctional complexes When studying the influence of P. aeruginosa and its virulence factors on epithelial barrier integrity or other aspects of the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process, choosing a cell culture model that expresses markers of the apical junctional complex is critical. While most epithelial cells, including lung, require growth on permeable membranes or as 3-D cultures to form tight junctions (e.g. A549, ΔF508-CFTR and WT-CFTR bronchial epithelial cells), a limited number of epithelial cells are capable of forming tight junctions when grown as 2-D monolayers (e.g., Caco-2, HT-29, T84) (Jain, et al., 2011, Hoentsch, et al., 2012, Law, et al., 2013). Interestingly, certain epithelial cells show enhanced barrier function in response to lipoxins, azithromycin or hypoxia (Kohler, et al., 2005, Asgrimsson, et al., 2006, Grumbach, et al., 2009, Hirota, et al., 2010, Olson, et al., 2011), while elevated (diabetic) glucose levels can reduce transepithelial resistance (Garnett, et al., 2013). Barrier integrity in an in vitro mucosal culture model is essential to avoid accessibility of P. aeruginosa to the basolateral surface, especially given its preferential binding to basolateral receptors (Bucior, et al., 2010). When studying the effect of P. aeruginosa virulence factors that affect barrier function (including ExoS, N-(3 oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12 HSL), rhamnolipids, and elastase (Azghani, et al., 1993, Vikstrom, et al., 2006, Zulianello, et al., 2006, Soong, et al., 2008, Halldorsson, et al., 2010, Wallace, et al., 2013)), it is important to distinguish targeted disruption of cell-cell contacts from host cell death and subsequent disruption of epithelial integrity (Zulianello, et al., 2006, Soong, et al., 2008, Engel & Eran, 2011). Using in vitro models that do not express tight junctions or have diminished barrier function are relevant for diseases involving repairing epithelium, while intact barrier integrity characterizes mucosal tissues of a healthy host (Plotkowski, et al., 1999, Garnett, et al., 2013).Extracellular matrix proteins As mentioned earlier, breaching of the epithelial barrier through injury or disruption of tight junctions can expose the basolateral surface to P. aeruginosa. ECM proteins of the basement membrane, such as fibronectin, laminin and collagens, enable P. aeruginosa adhesion and can contribute to colonization and dissemination (Trafny, et al., 1995, de Bentzmann, et al., 1996, Plotkowski, et al., 1996, Roger, et al., 1999). Furthermore, cellular ECM components at the apical surface whose expression has been reported to be induced in repairing epithelium, bind P. aeruginosa (Roger, et al., 1999). Therefore, the presence and distribution of these ECM proteins in an in vitro model of infection is of interest. Not only can the ECM composition of the basement membrane (and potentially apical surface) affect P. aeruginosa colonization, cellular differentiation is also greatly dependent on ECM proteins (Boudreau & Bissell, 1998, Simon-Assmann, et al., 1998). By means of example, 16 HBE cells are not polarized and do not express functional CFTR when grown at an ALI on thin collagen I gels, while these same cells are polarized and express apical CFTR on thick collagen I gels or on a mixture of ECM proteins (Cozens, et al., 1994, Plotkowski, et al., 1999) (Table 2). ECM composition of the basement membrane in an in vitro cell culture model will vary depending on (i) the ECM composition of the substrate on which the cells are grown (e.g. collagen I for ALI), (ii) the cell type chosen, and (iii) the experimental conditions for generating the model. Specifically, observations of lung and intestinal epithelial cells grown on microcarrier beads in 3-D in the RWV bioreactor exhibited higher levels of basolateral collagen IV and laminin, compared to the same cells grown as 2-D monolayers (Nickerson, et al., 2001, Carterson, et al., 2005). The use of IVOC models in these applications is also of interest since the in vivo basement membrane is maintained in these model systems (Tsang, et al., 1994, Middleton, et al., 2003). Taken together, it is of particular importance to choose an in vitro cell culture model that appropriately represents the cellular and basement membrane ECM composition when studying P. aeruginosa in the context of damaged/repairing epithelium, since enhanced binding to basolateral (and possibly apical) ECM components contributes to the infectious disease process.Mucus In the airways, mucins are either gel-like mucous secretions produced by goblet cells and submucosal glands (MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC2) or associated with the membranes or cilia of respiratory epithelial cells (MUC1, MUC4 and MUC16) (Hovenberg, et al., 1996) (Li, et al., 1997, Sharma, et al., 1998, Groneberg, et al., 2003, Schulz, et al., 2005). Ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells produce membrane-associated mucins (Buisine, et al., 1999, Hattrup & Gendler, 2008, Evans & Koo, 2009, Voynow & Rubin, 2009). Model systems that contain a mucus layer include IVOCs and primary airway epithelium grown at an ALI (Plotkowski, et al., 1991, Coakley, et al., 2003, Paradiso, et al., 2003, Gray, et al., 2004, Sajjan, et al., 2004). In addition, RWV-derived 3-D culture models of several epithelial cell lines (A549, BEAS2-B, HT-29, Int-407) exhibit mucus production, including MUC5AC and MUC1, while the same cells grown as 2-D monolayers show a very low or absent mucus content (Nickerson, et al., 2001, Carterson, et al., 2005, Honer zu Bentrup, et al., 2006, Vaughan, et al., 2006, Vertrees, et al., 2008, Radtke, et al., 2011). The absence or presence of this host-associated factor in an in vitro mucosal model can impact the outcome of a P. aeruginosa infectious disease study. The flagellum of P. aeruginosa binds carbohydrate structures of mucins (such as MUC1), which enhances P. aeruginosa adhesion (Carnoy, et al., 1994, Arora, et al., 1998, Lillehoj, et al., 2001, Lillehoj, et al., 2002, Mitchell, et al., 2002, Lu, et al., 2006). The presence of an apical mucus layer was shown to increase growth and/or adherence of P. aeruginosa compared to the same model in which the mucus layer was removed (Worlitzsch, et al., 2002, Garnett, et al., 2013). These data further indicate the importance of mucus when studying P. aeruginosa virulence traits. It is important to note that the physicochemical properties and/or thickness of the mucus layer in the airways and other tissues may vary depending on the disease studied. The most common example is the lungs of CF patients, where epithelial cells are covered with a thick dehydrated mucus layer that contains higher levels of DNA and lower levels of the MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins compared to normal lungs (Henke, et al., 2004, Rubin, 2007), even though concentrations of these mucins were not different during exacerbations (Henke, et al., 2007). In addition, mucus glycosylation of both secreted and cell-associated mucins is affected in patients with CF and results in a unique glycosylation phenotype (reviewed by (Venkatakrishnan, et al., 2013)). A link between dysfunctional CFTR in the CF patient population and undersialyation of membrane-tethered but not secreted mucins has been suggested (Barasch & al-Awqati, 1993, Dosanjh, et al., 1994, Kube, et al., 2001, Venkatakrishnan, et al., 2013), which reiterates the importance of a functional CFTR depending on the disease studied (see section on Apical-basolateral polarity). The CF mucus composition has been shown to drastically affect the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process. Specifically, normally hydrated mucus does not result in the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms as opposed to CF-like concentrated mucus (Matsui, et al., 2006). The unique CF glycosylation phenotype of mucins has been proposed to enhance P. aeruginosa adhesion to mucus, resulting in a diminished clearance (Martino, et al., 2011, Venkatakrishnan, et al., 2013). Since most ΔF508-CFTR mutant epithelial cell lines do not produce mucus or only limited amounts under currently tested culture conditions (Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2008), the combined role of the airway epithelium and the distinct CF mucus composition has not been extensively studied. Therefore, developing in vitro cell culture models that mimic the differentiated CF host epithelium and the associated mucus layer are of interest to the field.Cilia Mimicking the in vivo mucociliary clearance is also of interest when choosing a model to study P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, whether it is in the context of a healthy population or of an underlying disease. Herewith, it needs to be taken into consideration that certain diseases are characterized by dysfunctional cilia. In patients with CF, the impaired or absent mucociliary clearance is believed to be at least in part causative for the susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infections. In addition, other chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, immotile ciliary disorders, and physical injury (e.g., insertion of tracheal tubes, suction catheters, bronchoscopes) can result in impaired or absent ciliary function, and these patients frequently suffer from acute or chronic P. aeruginosa infections (Lieberman, 2003, Sagel, et al., 2011). Also, the ciliary beat frequency may vary depending on the location in the respiratory system (Zhao, et al., 2011). Therefore, the need for functional cilia in a lung tissue culture model largely depends on the disease studied and the experimental question being addressed. While P. aeruginosa was shown not to adhere to ciliated epithelial cells (Ramphal & Pyle, 1983, Plotkowski, et al., 1991, Woodworth, et al., 2008), ciliary beat frequency might affect the adherence of P. aeruginosa, with a higher beat frequency leading to lower adherence (Zhao, et al., 2011). These findings highlight the importance of mimicking mucociliary clearance in vitro. Most publications describing the effect of P. aeruginosa and its virulence factors (such as lectins, rhamnolipids, proteases and phenazines) on ciliary function have used primary respiratory epithelium grown as ALI or IVOCs (Wilson, et al., 1985, Hingley, et al., 1986, Hingley, et al., 1986, Munro, et al., 1989, Read, et al., 1992, Bajolet-Laudinat, et al., 1994). Indeed, these models contain ciliated cells at ratios similar to the respiratory mucosa. However, since cilia are already severely damaged after 2 hours of exposure to P. aeruginosa in IVOCs (Plotkowski, et al., 1991), it is challenging to assess the long-term role of cilia in the pathogenesis of this microorganism using currently available in vivo-like cell culture models. In this regard, it could be of interest to add antibiotics (such as bacitracin, clindamycin, gramicidin and roxithromycin) to the culture medium, since these agents were shown to partially counteract P. aeruginosa-induced effects on ciliary beat frequency (Mallants, et al., 2008).Multicellular complexity – The host and its indigenous microbiota Most in vitro cell culture models used to date for studying the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process were comprised of one cell type, whether that is a single cell line or primary cells. However, interactions between multiple cell types are necessary to mediate antimicrobial defense and inflammatory reactions normally observed in mucosal tissues. Therefore, using a series of hierarchical models with increasing complexity can help dissect molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, and replicate the in vivo infectious disease process more closely (Schmeichel & Bissell, 2003, Griffith & Swartz, 2006, Grandel, et al., 2009, Barrila, et al., 2010, Crabbé, et al., 2011). Two-dimensional monolayers of various epithelial cell lines typically result in a homogenous cell population of one cell type, while RWV-derived 3-D aggregates of these cell lines exhibit phenotypes of multiple cell types (Barrila, et al., 2010). For example, RWV-derived models of intestinal epithelium contained populations of enterocytes, M-like cells, Paneth cells and goblet cells, which represent four out of five major cell types in the in vivo parental tissue (Nickerson, et al., 2001, Honer zu Bentrup, et al., 2006, Radtke, et al., 2011). ALI cultures of primary respiratory epithelium generate basal, goblet and ciliated cells (Zulianello, et al., 2006), but do not recapitulate the more than forty epithelial cell types in the lung (Rock & Hogan, 2011). Therefore, the collective role of multiple cell types, including innate immune and other cell populations, and their interactions, are not considered using available in vitro cell culture models. IVOCs offer an interesting alternative since in theory all cells from the biopsy region are present in the model (Middleton, et al., 2003). However, the limited lifespan of immune cells such as lymphocytes in these models are a limitation of IVOCs when attempting to replicate the in vivo multicellular complexity (Farley, et al., 1986, Forsgren, et al., 1994). Reconstituting the entire functional cell population of a parental tissue in an in vitro setting is challenging. Challenges include (i) finding an appropriate medium type that enables growth of all cell types simultaneously, (ii) obtaining relevant 3-D organization of all cell types relative to each other, (iii) maintaining viability and physiologically relevant ratios of each respective cell type, (iv) incorporating appropriate physical forces, and (v) incorporating the relevant ECM composition required to support in vivo-like function of tissue-like constructs. Therefore, existing model systems have co-cultured two to three different cell types, mostly epithelial cells with neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, or lymphocytes, when investigating bacterial pathogenesis and host innate immunity in response to infection (reviewed by (Duell, et al., 2011)). Inclusion of immune cells such as macrophages or neutrophils are relevant given their generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and cytokines, which affect P. aeruginosa viability and expression of clinically important virulence factors (Mathee, et al., 1999, Forman & Torres, 2002, Wu, et al., 2005). Limited available literature incorporated multiple cell types of mucosal tissues in an in vitro model to study P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. A RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of alveolar epithelial cells and functional macrophages demonstrated that epithelial cells could protect macrophages from the cytotoxic effects of the quorum sensing molecule 3-oxo-C12 HSL (Crabbé, et al., 2011), presumably by enzymatic degradation (Chun, et al., 2004, Ozer, et al., 2005). A recent study by Tang et al. showed that co-culturing lung epithelial cells with wild type (but not CFTR knockout) lymphocytes affects bicarbonate secretion by CFTR, which in turn enhances the killing of P. aeruginosa (Tang, et al., 2012). Using a Transwell model of wild type or ΔF508-CFTR primary airway cells, Farberman et al. showed that P. aeruginosa-induced expression of CXC chemokines could attract neutrophils from the basolateral to apical surface more efficiently in CF cells (Farberman, et al., 2011). While the full potential of co-culture models remains to be explored, these studies highlight that mimicking the multicellular complexity of the in vivo parental tissue can provide novel insights in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, and can help dissect the role of each cell type and their interactions in the outcome of disease. Multicellular complexity of mucosal tissues also encompasses the thousands of microbial species that colonize the mucosal epithelium in health and disease. With the reciprocal interactions between the host and microbiome, and their key role in innate immunity, it has become increasingly clear that the indigenous microbiota are important in the infectious disease process (Chu & Mazmanian, 2013). Since the microbiota is involved in tissue differentiation and function, such as epithelial barrier function, mucus production, innate immune cell activation (Kau, et al., 2011, Han, et al., 2012, Holmes, et al., 2012, Lozupone, et al., 2012, Eloe-Fadrosh & Rasko, 2013), incorporating microbial communities when modeling in vivo P. aeruginosa infections is a logical consideration. As with building the host multicellular complexity, challenges arise with developing in vitro cell culture models that mimic the in vivo microbiome. These include the 70% as of yet unculturable bacteria in the human body, creating the right environment to maintain relevant ratios of community members (without having the faster growing organisms taking over the community), and maintaining host viability in the presence of large numbers of oxygen/nutrient-consuming organisms. To date, limited studies have incorporated host-associated microbial consortia in in vitro models, but we anticipate that future developments will further unveil the importance of the microbiome in host-pathogen interactions by P. aeruginosa. In vitro models of the microbiome are of particular importance since findings from animal models do not always translate to humans (Kau, et al., 2011).Other host factors altered during disease In this section, additional examples of disease-associated changes in the mucosal epithelium microenvironment that were found to alter the P. aeruginosa infectious disease process using in vitro cell culture models are discussed, i.e. iron, oxygen, pH and nutrients. Iron levels are increased in the CF lung environment (reviewed by (Reid, et al., 2007)), which is reflected in ΔF508-CFTR bronchial epithelial cells (Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2008). These enhanced iron levels resulted in higher host-associated P. aeruginosa biofilm formation compared to wild type CFTR cells (Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2008), which could be prevented by using a combination of iron chelators and tobramycin (Moreau-Marquis, et al., 2009). Another host-associated factor that plays a role in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis is hypoxia. Hypoxic growth conditions, associated with surgical injury in the intestinal tract, triggers production of the PA-I lectin in P. aeruginosa by soluble and contact-mediated factors released by intestinal epithelial cells (Kohler, et al., 2005). Similarly, hypoxic conditions in the context of CF lung disease were suggested to affect internalization of P. aeruginosa into different lung epithelial cell lines (Schaible, et al., 2013). However, Schaible et al. used non-polarized 2-D monolayers of lung epithelial cells that do not form tight junctions. Since reduced oxygen levels increase tight junction formation and polarization, this could have affected P. aeruginosa internalization (see section on Junctional complex) (Kohler, et al., 2005, Hirota, et al., 2010, Olson, et al., 2011). The pH of CF mucus has been shown to be lower than normal secretions (Coakley, et al., 2003, Song, et al., 2006), and could be correlated to differences in bicarbonate secretion by the epithelial cells (Paradiso, et al., 2003, Quinton, 2010). Lower pH levels in airway surface liquid reduced P. aeruginosa killing, presumably through inactivation of pH-sensitive antimicrobials (Pezzulo, et al., 2012). Finally, nutritional factors such as elevated basolateral glucose (CF-related diabetes) was shown to stimulate apical growth of P. aeruginosa, and this effect was more pronounced in CF airway epithelial cells (Garnett, et al., 2013). Additional host microenvironmental factors in mucosal tissues, such as changes in viscoelastic stretch forces during lung disease, are of interest to replicate in in vitro cell/tissue models when studying P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and have to our knowledge not yet been addressed.Perspectives In vitro cell culture models have layed the foundation for various novel antimicrobial approaches, of which some were tested in the clinic (Kohler, et al., 2010, Hoiby, 2011, Doring, et al., 2012). However, most of these new approaches against P. aeruginosa have failed during clinical trials, hereby reiterating the complexity of host physiology in health and disease. This reality emphasizes the need to develop and focus research efforts towards more differentiated physiologically relevant cell culture models. Appropriately representing the human host in a cell culture model is essential to capture complex reciprocal and dynamic interactions between the host, its microenvironment, and the pathogen, which govern the outcome of the infection process. With regard to in vitro cell culture models for studying P. aeruginosa pathogenesis, areas that need improvement include (i) enhancing host cell viability upon P. aeruginosa infection (especially in the context of chronic biofilm and adaptation studies), (ii) increasing the multicellular complexity (including immune cells and members of the indigenous microbiota), (iii) incorporating relevant ECM proteins, (iv) reconciling paracrine, endocrine and cellular factors, and (v) integrating physical forces to mimic multi-organ signaling and interactions that naturally occur within the context of the specific tissue microenvironment of interest. On the other hand, researchers currently have state-of-the-art, simplified models available that mimic the minimal functional unit of the differentiated tissue in vivo and remain to be fully explored for P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and drug design. In this regard, detailed knowledge of the in vivo characteristics of a given in vitro model is key to understanding whether a specific model system is suitable to answer the experimental question being asked, and to accurately understand the data gathered and extrapolate these to the in vivo disease process. With our continuously expanding understanding of the host microenvironmental factors that contribute to disease by P. aeruginosa, and our knowledge database and bioengineering abilities, in vitro model systems can and will continue to be improved to reconcile more physiological traits. Hence, antimicrobial therapies can be designed that are effective against the host-associated P. aeruginosa phenotype, and function in the unique, and sometimes chemically challenging in vivo conditions. Applying these valuable in vitro platforms to study P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will increase the translation of research findings from bench to clinic.Acknowledgements We apologize to all the researchers whose papers could not be cited in this review due to space limitations.
