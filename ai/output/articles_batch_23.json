    "abstract": "Abstract Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse [1]. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation [2] and is the main agent in complex processes that includes transport [3], and interaction with other phytohormones [4,5,6]. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity [7], cytoskeletal interaction [8,9], ions [10,11,12,13], and light [14,15,16,17,18]. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth [19,20], branching [21], and differentiation [22]. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices [23], developing seeds [24] and young leaves [25] and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model” [2]. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane [26]. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues [27]. PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots [23] and is essential for efflux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells [28,29]. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells [30]; they direct the auxin flow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots [31], which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efflux towards the columella cells [32]. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots [33]. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin flow toward the cortical and epidermal cells [34,35]. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone [36]. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis [37,38], which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse [39,40,41]. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis [28] and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation [42]. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent [43] and a mutation in the PIN3 gene affects differential growth [42]. Hence, PIN3 is an important factor for shoot graviresponse [43]. The PIN3 homologs PIN4 and PIN7 are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse [43]. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse [44]. A mutation in ARG1 affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls [45] but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes [46]. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic [47], and gravitropic response [48] and PIN1 mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence axes [49]. Another Auxin Response Element promotes IAA5, a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes [50,51] that are governed by auxin [52]. Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of Brassica rapa. Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed [53] and used as a reference gene [54,55,56], its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression [57,58] during graviresponse [59], spatio-temporal differences in gene regulation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissue/region under consideration. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression profiles [60]. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal profile that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) [59,61], which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription profiles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material Seeds of Brassica rapa vs. rapa were germinated at 25 °C in darkness between germination paper that was positioned on top of five mm thick floral foam to avoid thigmotropic stimulation of roots upon emergence. Seedlings with an average root length of 10 mm were used for experimentation 42 h after imbibition. All experiments were performed in moist petri dishes. 4.2. Gravistimulation and Tissue Sampling Vertically grown and positioned seedlings were reoriented such that the entire seedling was positioned horizontally. Before reorientation and 4 and 11 h after reorientation, the hypocotyl was dissected into two parts (left/right for vertical controls and upper/lower for horizontally oriented seedlings). Samples obtained after 48 h did not include tissue samples as the tissue size after 48 h of additional growth exceeded the extraction capacity. The apical two mm of the root tip were removed using a scalpel and used as additional reference tissue. All tissue samples were immediately submersed in liquid nitrogen. 4.3. RNA Extraction Total RNA extraction of tissue (hypocotyl and 2 mm long root tip) was performed using the Sigma Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit. For each time point three biological replicates with material from 20 seedlings each were analyzed. The samples were homogenized in a microfuge tube for one min in lysis solution followed by vortexing, then heated (50 °C for 5 min in a water bath) and centrifuged (16,000× g, 4 min). The supernatant was transferred into a microfuge tube containing a filter column and centrifuged (16,000× g, 90 s). The filtrate was transferred to a binding column and centrifuged at 16,000× g for 90 s. The flow through, as well as the solution from three successive wash steps (500 µL wash buffer each), were discarded. The filter column was centrifuged to remove any remaining solution before the elution buffer was added for 1 min, followed by centrifugation (16,000× g for 90 s). The eluant contained total RNA and was immediately put on ice. The RNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer. The total RNA was diluted with deionized DEPC water to a concentration of 100 ng/µL. 4.4. SPGE Probe Preparation mRNA Extraction Solid Phase Gene Extraction used #6 acupuncture needles (SEIRIN, Kyoto, Japan). Batches of 40 needles were sonicated sequentially in hexane, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min each, followed by air drying at 80 °C for 15 min. The needles were functionalized by incubation in a mixture of 0.25 mL (3-glycodoxypropyl) trimethoxy silane (3GTMO, SPI-Chem, West Chester, PA, USA) in 0.75 mL xylene and 10 µL diisopropylethylamine in a sealed amber glass vial at 80 °C overnight. The needles were cooled, washed thrice with ethyl acetate, air dried for 10 min and incubated in 1 µM NH2-oligo (dT)15 nucleotides in 0.1 M KOH at 37 °C for 6 h (four needles per 20 µL solution in closed PCR tubes). The functionalized needles were rinsed thrice with deionized water (50 °C) for 5 min each, followed by drying at room temperature. Functionalized needles were inserted for one minute into the hypocotyl and the root tip (Figure 1) four, 11 and 48 h after reorientation. The probes were manually inserted in about 10 s intervals about one mm deep into the cortical tissue in the sequence shown in Figure 1. Hypocotyls were discarded if the probes were placed inaccurately. After 11 h, the curvature reached about 45 degrees, which resulted in stacked arrangement of the loop ends of the probes. Root tips were sampled by inserting the needle into the approximate area of the quiescent center. This approach was chosen as this tissue is not differentiated. For each time point, needles from three different seedlings were combined according to their position and considered one biological sample. Three biological samples (i.e., nine seedlings) were measured. 4.5. Reverse Transcription Two µL of oligo-dTs and RNA (10 µL of total RNA or three SPGE probes) were added to a PCR tube. The tubes were heated for five min in a Thermocycler (Hybaid, PCR Express) to 80 °C. A master-mix was prepared that contained 4.2 µL deionized water for total RNA or 16.2 µL for SPGE samples. All samples contained 2 µL 10 X buffer, 0.8 µL 25 mM dNTP and 1 µL reverse transcriptase (final concentrations: 1 mM dNTP, 1X reverse transcription buffer, and 50 U MultiscribeTM reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem high-capacity cDNA kit). This master-mix was added to RNA/oligo dT mix (eight µL for total RNA and 20 µL for SPGE) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 37 °C for 2 h, and deactivated at 85 °C for 5 min. cDNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS–11 spectrophotometer. 4.6. Transcript Quantification Using qPCR cDNA was diluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water to a concentration of 250 ng/µL and stored at −20 °C. The transcripts of UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 were measured using qPCR with primers and their efficiencies listed in Table 1. Each sample consisted of three biological and three technical replicates each. Each 10 µL reaction contained 5 µL 2X SYBR green PCR mastermix, 1 µL primer mix (0.5 µL forward +0.5 µL reverse primer, 250 nM final concentration) and 4 µL of 250 ng/µL cDNA. qPCR was started at 95 °C and then cycled 40 times between 60 °C (60 s) and 95 °C (15 s) in a StepOneTM qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 02454, USA). All qPCR products were subjected to melt analysis. Table 1. Primer information for UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1. The amplicon size includes the primer pairs.

Analyses The fold-changes in transcripts for different times of reorientation were referenced to UBQ using the ΔΔ Cq method [72]. Log-transformed data avoid skewness of small values and results in symmetrical representation of up- and downregulation of transcription [73]. The ratios of Cq values of UBQ1 obtained from bottom vs. top flank or for SPGE needle 1, 2, 3 (=top or left) and needle 4, 5, 6 (=bottom or right) were calculated for each condition and used as reference. All Cq values, ratios, or log (2) data transformation was performed in Microsoft Excel and statistically analyzed using the ANOVA function (Excel 2019).",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. Time Course of Curvature As reported earlier [1], dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction (Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) Extraction of mRNA using Solid Phase Gene Extraction: Oligo-dT15 functionalized stainless-steel needles were inserted into the upper and lower side of horizontally placed hypocotyls and the root tip of Brassica rapa seedlings. The hybridization between the dT and poly A tail of the mRNA was accomplished in 60 s. (B) Drawings that represent hypocotyl curvature during the experiments. (C) Sampling of the upper and lower flank of hypocotyl tissue.The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 ± 16 µg) was significantly higher (p < 10−10) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 ± 0.024 µg). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady (Figure 2), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower flank remained similar (p = 0.75) throughout the experimental period (Figure 3); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Absolute Cq values for UBQ1 obtained by tissue extraction (solid lines) and SPGE (patterned lines). The top flank showed reduced (higher Cq values) transcription compared to the bottom flank. The numbers 1–6 correspond to locations in Figure 1. Mean ± SE, n = 9.Figure 3.

Time = 0 refers to vertical position. Transcription of UBQ1 did not change significantly after reorientation (p = 0.75); mean ± SE, n = 9. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right flanks of vertically oriented hypocotyls (Figure 4) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities (Figure 5). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Absolute Cq values of the investigated genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 obtained after extracting tissue of the left and right flank of a vertically grown B. rapa seedlings. Mean ± SE, n = 9.Figure 5. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in tissue samples of the upper (black) and lower (red) flank of hypocotyls of horizontally reoriented Brassica rapa seedlings four and 11 h after reorientation relative to the transcription of UBQ1. The transcription was upregulated in the bottom flank and downregulated in upper flank. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9.The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar profiles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower flank (Figure 6) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 after Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) of curving Brassica rapa hypocotyls relative to UBQ1 values. Probe 1 (apical end of curvature zone), 2 (center), and 3 (basal end, at root/shoot junction) sampled the upper flank (black lines) and probes 4, 5 and 6 sampled the corresponding positions along the bottom flank (red lines), see Figure 1. The transcription profiles are shown for 4, 11 and 48 h after horizontal reorientation. Positive and negative values indicate up- and downregulation, respectively. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9.SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe #2 and #5, Figure 1) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position five vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h (Figure 6). Considering the transcription for probe two and five (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave flank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (#5) than top (#2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about five times the value of the top flank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h. 2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction The average of the transcription values of all three SPGE probes on either flank was compared with corresponding tissue data of the lower and upper flank. The SPGE values for all examined genes were similar or slightly higher than the tissue values. The overall profile for all tested genes was comparable for both methods, i.e., upregulation along the bottom flank and downregulation in the upper side until 11 h after reorientation (Figure 7). Consistently, this trend was reversed after 48 h. The transcription of all genes showed the greatest variability 11 h after reorientation, consistent with the onset of curvature reversal from positive to negative. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of transcription profiles of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in B. rapa seedlings in tissue after four and 11 h of reorientation (upper panel) and SPGE extraction (lower panel) after four, 11 and 48 h reorientation. The data for SPGE top and bottom refers to the average values of the combined probes 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. All values are shown as fold change based on UBQ1. Mean ± SE, n = 9. 2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated [1], the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. ARG1 showed the highest transcription value compared to the other examined genes (Figure 8). The transcription of all genes increased strongly at four hours followed by a gradual increase at 11 h after reorientation. SPGE showed upregulation for both PIN1 and ARG1 at all times after reorientation. PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom flanks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar (p = 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation. Figure 8. Open in a new tab The transcription profile of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in the root tip after horizontal reorientation of B. rapa seedlings. Data were tissue (red) or SPGE (black) sampling of the 2 mm tip region. The transcripts were referenced to UBQ1. The least significant difference (LSD) was calculated separately for tissue and SPGE samples. Mean ± SE, n = 3.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion 3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We verified the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom flanks of the curving hypocotyls did not change significantly (Figure 2). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development and/or differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identified as a reference gene [62] and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower flanks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings [59]. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of B. rapa and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established [29,63,64], and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical (Figure 5). The initiation and termination of bending [65] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [1]. The differential elongation [4] corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of B. rapa, Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established [1]. 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repressors, and other auxin signaling factors [66]. The varying transcription of genes in B. rapa roots [53], indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank (Figure 3 and Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower flank and downregulation along the upper flank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls [1]. The increased transcription activity along the lower flank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (up/down, Figure 5 and Figure 6) is high and suggests auxin flow to the lower flank. At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h [1], the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point [3] that leads to the subsequent reversal of curvature at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors [67]. The significance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls. Although the transcription profile 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both flanks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. The high-resolution SPGE analysis revealed changes in the transcription profile within the curving tissue (Figure 6). The greatest polarity was associated with the central probes (#2 and #5), therefore SPGE profiling is sensitive to spatial differentiation and expansion. The differences between the central and distal probes illustrate both auxin effect and the spatial dependency of gene activation. Future work will investigate if vertically oriented hypocotyls show maturation-dependent changes in gene transcription. The combination of sensitivity, age, and stimulation (auxin) are likely to control (differential) elongation Despite the overall similarity in the assessment of transcription activities, there were differences between the individual genes and sampling positions. Notably PIN1 and PIN3 showed its lowest transcription after four hours at the apical-most upper position and increased without reaching a minimum at 11 h. The same trend prevailed for IAA5 and ARG1 (Figure 6). Possibly, the apical region is less sensitive for curvature, and thus, inhibition. Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis [46] and their involvement in shoot gravitropism [43] via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue. Nonetheless, the polarity of all examined genes was higher for SPGE than for tissue analyses (Figure 5 vs. Figure 6), supporting SPGE-based sampling as a valuable tool for the study of physiological processes. IAA5 is considered a gravitropic response indicator as its distribution reflects gravity-induced auxin asymmetry [68]. IAA5 had the highest transcription levels (lowest Cq values, Figure 4). However, its lateral polarity was less than that of the other examined genes. 3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl The root tips of horizontally oriented seedlings reach a vertical position after four hours of reorientation [1]. Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reflects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a significant delay. Both sampling profiles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis [69]. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously [1,70,71] and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specific differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl-related changes in gene transcription. This notion likely extends to other species that show a biphasic response in hypocotyl curvature. Equally important is the confirmation that the positive and negative hypocotyl curvature depends on similar hormonal signaling mechanisms as root curvature. 3.5. Comparison of RNA Extraction Techniques Although the yield of tissue extraction is about 400 times the yield of SPGE extraction (see Section 2.1), SPGE data show greater polarity than tissue extraction (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7). The large tissue quantity not only diminishes the differential signal but is problematic as large quantities make differential sampling unreliable. The much higher spatial resolution of SPGE avoids such complications, is accurate, and can readily and repeatedly determine RNA profiles without purification [61]. Overall, the data show that SPGE allows for mRNA profiling at high spatial resolution that is useful for the determination of transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli in plants and other biological systems.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin mediated process and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature.

Copyright notice ID: 9105288 PMID: 35567192 Abstract Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes. Keywords: Brassica rapa, Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE), germination, gravitropism, hypocotyl, root1. Introduction Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse [1]. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation [2] and is the main agent in complex processes that includes transport [3], and interaction with other phytohormones [4,5,6]. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity [7], cytoskeletal interaction [8,9], ions [10,11,12,13], and light [14,15,16,17,18]. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth [19,20], branching [21], and differentiation [22]. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices [23], developing seeds [24] and young leaves [25] and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model” [2]. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane [26]. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues [27]. PIN1 is typically present in xylem associated cells in shoots and roots [23] and is essential for efflux of the auxin anion from vasculature to root apices via protophloem cells [28,29]. In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells [30]; they direct the auxin flow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots [31], which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efflux towards the columella cells [32]. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots [33]. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin flow toward the cortical and epidermal cells [34,35]. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone [36]. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis [37,38], which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse [39,40,41]. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis [28] and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation [42]. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent [43] and a mutation in the PIN3 gene affects differential growth [42]. Hence, PIN3 is an important factor for shoot graviresponse [43]. The PIN3 homologs PIN4 and PIN7 are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse [43]. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse [44]. A mutation in ARG1 affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls [45] but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes [46]. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic [47], and gravitropic response [48] and PIN1 mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence axes [49]. Another Auxin Response Element promotes IAA5, a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes [50,51] that are governed by auxin [52]. Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG in vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls of Brassica rapa. Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed [53] and used as a reference gene [54,55,56], its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Despite many studies on PAT in hypocotyls and on effects of auxin on gene expression [57,58] during graviresponse [59], spatio-temporal differences in gene regulation during hypocotyl curvature have not been studied. Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissue/region under consideration. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression profiles [60]. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal profile that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) [59,61], which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription profiles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature.2. Results 2.1. Time Course of Curvature As reported earlier [1], dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation).2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction (Figure 1). Figure 1.

The hybridization between the dT and poly A tail of the mRNA was accomplished in 60 s. (B) Drawings that represent hypocotyl curvature during the experiments. (C) Sampling of the upper and lower flank of hypocotyl tissue.The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 ± 16 µg) was significantly higher (p < 10−10) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 ± 0.024 µg). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady (Figure 2), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower flank remained similar (p = 0.75) throughout the experimental period (Figure 3); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Absolute Cq values for UBQ1 obtained by tissue extraction (solid lines) and SPGE (patterned lines). The top flank showed reduced (higher Cq values) transcription compared to the bottom flank. The numbers 1–6 correspond to locations in Figure 1. Mean ± SE, n = 9.Figure 3.

Time = 0 refers to vertical position. Transcription of UBQ1 did not change significantly after reorientation (p = 0.75); mean ± SE, n = 9.2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right flanks of vertically oriented hypocotyls (Figure 4) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities (Figure 5). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Absolute Cq values of the investigated genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 obtained after extracting tissue of the left and right flank of a vertically grown B. rapa seedlings. Mean ± SE, n = 9.Figure 5. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in tissue samples of the upper (black) and lower (red) flank of hypocotyls of horizontally reoriented Brassica rapa seedlings four and 11 h after reorientation relative to the transcription of UBQ1. The transcription was upregulated in the bottom flank and downregulated in upper flank. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9.The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar profiles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower flank (Figure 6) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 after Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) of curving Brassica rapa hypocotyls relative to UBQ1 values. Probe 1 (apical end of curvature zone), 2 (center), and 3 (basal end, at root/shoot junction) sampled the upper flank (black lines) and probes 4, 5 and 6 sampled the corresponding positions along the bottom flank (red lines), see Figure 1. The transcription profiles are shown for 4, 11 and 48 h after horizontal reorientation. Positive and negative values indicate up- and downregulation, respectively. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9.SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe #2 and #5, Figure 1) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position five vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h (Figure 6). Considering the transcription for probe two and five (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave flank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (#5) than top (#2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about five times the value of the top flank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h.2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction The average of the transcription values of all three SPGE probes on either flank was compared with corresponding tissue data of the lower and upper flank. The SPGE values for all examined genes were similar or slightly higher than the tissue values. The overall profile for all tested genes was comparable for both methods, i.e., upregulation along the bottom flank and downregulation in the upper side until 11 h after reorientation (Figure 7). Consistently, this trend was reversed after 48 h. The transcription of all genes showed the greatest variability 11 h after reorientation, consistent with the onset of curvature reversal from positive to negative. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of transcription profiles of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in B. rapa seedlings in tissue after four and 11 h of reorientation (upper panel) and SPGE extraction (lower panel) after four, 11 and 48 h reorientation. The data for SPGE top and bottom refers to the average values of the combined probes 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. All values are shown as fold change based on UBQ1. Mean ± SE, n = 9.2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated [1], the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. ARG1 showed the highest transcription value compared to the other examined genes (Figure 8). The transcription of all genes increased strongly at four hours followed by a gradual increase at 11 h after reorientation. SPGE showed upregulation for both PIN1 and ARG1 at all times after reorientation. PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom flanks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar (p = 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation. Figure 8. Open in a new tab The transcription profile of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in the root tip after horizontal reorientation of B. rapa seedlings. Data were tissue (red) or SPGE (black) sampling of the 2 mm tip region. The transcripts were referenced to UBQ1. The least significant difference (LSD) was calculated separately for tissue and SPGE samples. Mean ± SE, n = 3.3. Discussion 3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We verified the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom flanks of the curving hypocotyls did not change significantly (Figure 2). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development and/or differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identified as a reference gene [62] and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower flanks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings [59].3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of B. rapa and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established [29,63,64], and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical (Figure 5). The initiation and termination of bending [65] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [1]. The differential elongation [4] corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of B. rapa, Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established [1].3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repressors, and other auxin signaling factors [66]. The varying transcription of genes in B. rapa roots [53], indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank (Figure 3 and Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower flank and downregulation along the upper flank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls [1]. The increased transcription activity along the lower flank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (up/down, Figure 5 and Figure 6) is high and suggests auxin flow to the lower flank. At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h [1], the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point [3] that leads to the subsequent reversal of curvature at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors [67]. The significance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls. Although the transcription profile 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both flanks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. The high-resolution SPGE analysis revealed changes in the transcription profile within the curving tissue (Figure 6). The greatest polarity was associated with the central probes (#2 and #5), therefore SPGE profiling is sensitive to spatial differentiation and expansion. The differences between the central and distal probes illustrate both auxin effect and the spatial dependency of gene activation. Future work will investigate if vertically oriented hypocotyls show maturation-dependent changes in gene transcription. The combination of sensitivity, age, and stimulation (auxin) are likely to control (differential) elongation Despite the overall similarity in the assessment of transcription activities, there were differences between the individual genes and sampling positions. Notably PIN1 and PIN3 showed its lowest transcription after four hours at the apical-most upper position and increased without reaching a minimum at 11 h. The same trend prevailed for IAA5 and ARG1 (Figure 6). Possibly, the apical region is less sensitive for curvature, and thus, inhibition. Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis [46] and their involvement in shoot gravitropism [43] via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue. Nonetheless, the polarity of all examined genes was higher for SPGE than for tissue analyses (Figure 5 vs. Figure 6), supporting SPGE-based sampling as a valuable tool for the study of physiological processes. IAA5 is considered a gravitropic response indicator as its distribution reflects gravity-induced auxin asymmetry [68]. IAA5 had the highest transcription levels (lowest Cq values, Figure 4). However, its lateral polarity was less than that of the other examined genes. 3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl The root tips of horizontally oriented seedlings reach a vertical position after four hours of reorientation [1]. Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reflects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a significant delay. Both sampling profiles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis [69]. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously [1,70,71] and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specific differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl-related changes in gene transcription. This notion likely extends to other species that show a biphasic response in hypocotyl curvature. Equally important is the confirmation that the positive and negative hypocotyl curvature depends on similar hormonal signaling mechanisms as root curvature.3.5. Comparison of RNA Extraction Techniques Although the yield of tissue extraction is about 400 times the yield of SPGE extraction (see Section 2.1), SPGE data show greater polarity than tissue extraction (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7). The large tissue quantity not only diminishes the differential signal but is problematic as large quantities make differential sampling unreliable. The much higher spatial resolution of SPGE avoids such complications, is accurate, and can readily and repeatedly determine RNA profiles without purification [61]. Overall, the data show that SPGE allows for mRNA profiling at high spatial resolution that is useful for the determination of transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli in plants and other biological systems.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Plant Material Seeds of Brassica rapa vs. rapa were germinated at 25 °C in darkness between germination paper that was positioned on top of five mm thick floral foam to avoid thigmotropic stimulation of roots upon emergence. Seedlings with an average root length of 10 mm were used for experimentation 42 h after imbibition. All experiments were performed in moist petri dishes.4.2. Gravistimulation and Tissue Sampling Vertically grown and positioned seedlings were reoriented such that the entire seedling was positioned horizontally. Before reorientation and 4 and 11 h after reorientation, the hypocotyl was dissected into two parts (left/right for vertical controls and upper/lower for horizontally oriented seedlings). Samples obtained after 48 h did not include tissue samples as the tissue size after 48 h of additional growth exceeded the extraction capacity. The apical two mm of the root tip were removed using a scalpel and used as additional reference tissue. All tissue samples were immediately submersed in liquid nitrogen.4.3. RNA Extraction Total RNA extraction of tissue (hypocotyl and 2 mm long root tip) was performed using the Sigma Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit. For each time point three biological replicates with material from 20 seedlings each were analyzed. The samples were homogenized in a microfuge tube for one min in lysis solution followed by vortexing, then heated (50 °C for 5 min in a water bath) and centrifuged (16,000× g, 4 min). The supernatant was transferred into a microfuge tube containing a filter column and centrifuged (16,000× g, 90 s). The filtrate was transferred to a binding column and centrifuged at 16,000× g for 90 s. The flow through, as well as the solution from three successive wash steps (500 µL wash buffer each), were discarded. The filter column was centrifuged to remove any remaining solution before the elution buffer was added for 1 min, followed by centrifugation (16,000× g for 90 s). The eluant contained total RNA and was immediately put on ice. The RNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer. The total RNA was diluted with deionized DEPC water to a concentration of 100 ng/µL.4.4. SPGE Probe Preparation mRNA Extraction Solid Phase Gene Extraction used #6 acupuncture needles (SEIRIN, Kyoto, Japan). Batches of 40 needles were sonicated sequentially in hexane, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min each, followed by air drying at 80 °C for 15 min. The needles were functionalized by incubation in a mixture of 0.25 mL (3-glycodoxypropyl) trimethoxy silane (3GTMO, SPI-Chem, West Chester, PA, USA) in 0.75 mL xylene and 10 µL diisopropylethylamine in a sealed amber glass vial at 80 °C overnight. The needles were cooled, washed thrice with ethyl acetate, air dried for 10 min and incubated in 1 µM NH2-oligo (dT)15 nucleotides in 0.1 M KOH at 37 °C for 6 h (four needles per 20 µL solution in closed PCR tubes). The functionalized needles were rinsed thrice with deionized water (50 °C) for 5 min each, followed by drying at room temperature. Functionalized needles were inserted for one minute into the hypocotyl and the root tip (Figure 1) four, 11 and 48 h after reorientation. The probes were manually inserted in about 10 s intervals about one mm deep into the cortical tissue in the sequence shown in Figure 1. Hypocotyls were discarded if the probes were placed inaccurately. After 11 h, the curvature reached about 45 degrees, which resulted in stacked arrangement of the loop ends of the probes. Root tips were sampled by inserting the needle into the approximate area of the quiescent center. This approach was chosen as this tissue is not differentiated. For each time point, needles from three different seedlings were combined according to their position and considered one biological sample. Three biological samples (i.e., nine seedlings) were measured.4.5. Reverse Transcription Two µL of oligo-dTs and RNA (10 µL of total RNA or three SPGE probes) were added to a PCR tube. The tubes were heated for five min in a Thermocycler (Hybaid, PCR Express) to 80 °C. A master-mix was prepared that contained 4.2 µL deionized water for total RNA or 16.2 µL for SPGE samples. All samples contained 2 µL 10 X buffer, 0.8 µL 25 mM dNTP and 1 µL reverse transcriptase (final concentrations: 1 mM dNTP, 1X reverse transcription buffer, and 50 U MultiscribeTM reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem high-capacity cDNA kit). This master-mix was added to RNA/oligo dT mix (eight µL for total RNA and 20 µL for SPGE) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 37 °C for 2 h, and deactivated at 85 °C for 5 min. cDNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS–11 spectrophotometer.4.6. Transcript Quantification Using qPCR cDNA was diluted with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water to a concentration of 250 ng/µL and stored at −20 °C. The transcripts of UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5, and ARG1 were measured using qPCR with primers and their efficiencies listed in Table 1. Each sample consisted of three biological and three technical replicates each. Each 10 µL reaction contained 5 µL 2X SYBR green PCR mastermix, 1 µL primer mix (0.5 µL forward +0.5 µL reverse primer, 250 nM final concentration) and 4 µL of 250 ng/µL cDNA. qPCR was started at 95 °C and then cycled 40 times between 60 °C (60 s) and 95 °C (15 s) in a StepOneTM qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 02454, USA). All qPCR products were subjected to melt analysis. Table 1. Primer information for UBQ1, PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1. The amplicon size includes the primer pairs.

Analyses The fold-changes in transcripts for different times of reorientation were referenced to UBQ using the ΔΔ Cq method [72]. Log-transformed data avoid skewness of small values and results in symmetrical representation of up- and downregulation of transcription [73]. The ratios of Cq values of UBQ1 obtained from bottom vs. top flank or for SPGE needle 1, 2, 3 (=top or left) and needle 4, 5, 6 (=bottom or right) were calculated for each condition and used as reference. All Cq values, ratios, or log (2) data transformation was performed in Microsoft Excel and statistically analyzed using the ANOVA function (Excel 2019).5. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that the basal hypocotyl curvature depends on auxin mediated process and involves the same genes for downward or upward curvature that were found to be involved in root curvature. The expression trend for auxin related genes in positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature reverses when the hypocotyls begin to develop negative gravitropism. High resolution sampling revealed spatial variation in the transcription of auxin related genes throughout the curvature with the greatest polarity present at the most concave and convex position in the curvature.Author Contributions C.A. and K.H.H. conceived the experiments, C.A. performed the research.

    "abstract": "Abstract Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations. Subject terms: Biological techniques, Biophysics, Plant sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction The perception of the gravity stimulus and the involvement of amyloplasts have long been the focus of plant biology because of the cryptic nature of essential steps in the response of a biological system to physical stimuli such as gravity1–4. While the first step of the gravitropic response primarily depends on the interaction of intracellular particles with Earth’s gravitational field, the ability to respond to the gravity signal depends on biological conditions such as auxin sensitivity and transport5, time6,7, the cytoskeleton8 and physical parameters such as temperature9, orientation10,11, osmotic conditions12, mechanical noise13, cytoplasmic viscosity14, and high-gradient magnetic fields15–17. The redundancy contributes to the stability of the graviresponse system and can integrate additional signals such as hydrotropism18,19 and touch20,21. Because any physiological response is a function of the accumulated signal (auxin, altered gene expression, pH, ion, or charge shifts), control of the response shifts from the original signal to downstream events such as signal processing (translation) and response variables that are related to signal strength and persistence22. Therefore, the analysis of mechano-sensing and (gravi)response depends on the elimination of the gravity effects by experimenting under weightlessness conditions in space. The study of HGMF on amyloplast movements was attempted in ground studies15,23–26 and was the focus of a shuttle experiment in 2003 (STS-107)27. However, the disintegration of the Shuttle during reentry made the intended analyses impossible. Nonetheless, this experiment provided strong evidence that mechano-sensitivity increased in microgravity27. Here we report data from a space experiment on the Space-X Crew Resupply Service 3 mission. The aim of this investigation was to repeat the ill-fated experiment on STS-107. However, instead of flax (Linum usitatissimum) we used Brassica rapa seeds to study the effect of magnetic gradients and to take advantage of its Arabidopsis-related genome to assess transcriptional responses of genes related to growth, metabolism, auxin, and stress. Because of the dual effort to characterize the effect of HGMF and transcriptional analysis the remainder of the introduction covers separately each aspect. HGMF Induction of curvature by magneto-mechanical forces depends on the magnetic susceptibility (ϰ), which is characteristic of a given substance and describes its ability to acquire magnetization I as a result of the (inducing) magnetic field H such that I = ϰH. Diamagnetic substances have negative susceptibility and include the vast majority of biological substances. However, some metal-containing proteins such as hemoglobin, cytochrome, ferritin etc., can have positive susceptibility and are paramagnetic26,28,29. The magnetic susceptibility of dia- and paramagnetic compounds is proportional to their density and their behavior in a magnetic gradient is analogous to that in the gravity field16,24,26. Magnetic susceptibility and density of the cytoplasm are equal to that of water, ϰ w = 7.2 × 10–7 emu (electromagnetic units, table value), and that of starch ϰst = (8 ± 0.2) × 10–7, thus the differential susceptibility between starch and cytoplasm Δϰ ≈ 8 × 10–8 emu. The density of starch ρst = 1.5 g/cm3, and cytoplasm ~ 1 g/cm3; therefore Δρ = 0.5 g/cm3 and Δp/Δ ϰ ≈ − 6 × 106 (g/cm3)/emu26. Although other methods of generating HGMF are available24,26, the generation of a magnetic gradient in the experiments described here, was realized by inserting into a uniform, strong magnetic field ferromagnetic wedges. The wedges become magnetized and create a HGMF (Fig. 1) such that the gradient ∇H is directed toward the tip of the wedge. Therefore, the force acting on a diamagnetic body (ϰ < 0) repels starch-filled amyloplasts from the inserted object. In contrast, a para- or ferromagnetic body (ϰ > 0) would experience an attractive force. The force generated by the HGMF utilized in the employed setup has been determined previously to be about 0.6 g30 and exceeds the acceleration that plants respond to (about 10–3 g31). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The design of the magnetic field chamber (MFC) with 10 magnets arranged in two stories with a total of eight compartments. The magnetic field was contained with two ferromagnetic yokes. Each compartment contained two ferromagnetic wedges and two pieces of activated charcoal cloth (ACC), and one seed cassette each. The diagram on the upper right shows the distortion of the magnetic field by the wedges (applicable to all compartments) and the projected growth of the seedling roots. The flow path of the fixative from a single fill port (F) to the drain port (D) is shown as white canals for front-visible paths; connections on the rear side between the individual compartments are shown as dark lines.In contrast to cultivation on earth where orienting factors are provided by gravity as constant and light as intermittent influence, plant growth in space cannot rely on gravitational clues; it depends on the plants’ (intermittent) phototropic response. However, in the absence of light, especially root elongation is variable, and orientation responds mostly to water gradients (hydrotropism)19,32. Removing the two most consequential vectors for plant orientation, i.e., growing plants under weightlessness conditions in the dark, provides an opportunity to examine the role of amyloplasts for directional growth analogous to their role in gravity sensing. Probing magnetophoretic effects and the space conditions on root growth was the objective for the experiment described here. The investigation included transcription analyses of 16 genes that represent auxin effects (IAA5, PIN 1, 3, 7) as the main growth regulator of differential elongation33–35, starch katabolism (Amy1)36, sucrose synthase (SUS, cell wall formation)37, UBQ1 (ubiquitin1; a putative reference38 and indicator of protein metabolism)39, TUB1 (tubulin1; reference38, cell growth, mitosis), ACT7 (actin7; putative reference40, root growth and germination41), ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase; stress response42), COX (cytochrome oxidase subunit1; metabolism, stress43), G6PDH5 (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase5; oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, basic metabolism44), GLK (glucokinase; carbohydrate metabolism45) HXK (hexokinase 1; glucose metabolism and developmental regulator46), PFK (phosphofructokinase; carbohydrate metabolism, hypoxia stress47), and TAGL (triacylglycerol lipase; lipid metabolism48,49). The transcription pattern of these genes under conditions such as space (weightlessness), clinorotation (enhanced mechanostimulation), and static controls provided information on how seedlings respond to the respective conditions. This report describes an experiment that built on prior experience (i.e., Biotube1 on STS-107) but used genetically better-characterized plant material, Brassica rapa. Our data support HGMFs as suitable method to establish plant orientation in space but also show that mechanostimulation affects gravisensing-related metabolism. The report demonstrates that plants perceive weightlessness (“micro-gravity”) and respond by enhanced starch production in gravity perceiving cells.",

Curvature induction by HGMF Exposure to HGMF induced curvature (Sup. Video 1, Table 2). However, substantial curvature occurred in both presence and absence of magnetic gradients. The non-magnetic chamber showed 81% curvature in roots within the seed cassette around the germination paper (Fig. 2). Table 2.

Open in a new tab Example of root orientation inside seed cassettes. The predominant curvature and elongation occurred onto and along the surface of the germination paper.MFCs with magnets showed curvature that was independent of the HGMF because of growth patterns or curvature occurring inside the seed cassettes where the magnetic gradient was too weak to affect curvature. The comparison of space-grown or static ground control seedlings exposed to HGMF with seedlings grown in the non-magnetic field chamber (#1 and #23 in Sup. Table 2) shows strong correspondence between the two conditions (Fig. 3), indicating that magnetic fields do not affect general metabolism or transcription activity. This notion is in line with reports that failed to detect effects of magnetic fields on growth52,53 but contrasts with effects of weak magnetic fields on root curvature54 and effects of the geomagnetic field on stress response and hormesis55,56. The geomagnetic field (typically about 0.5 G) is orders of magnitude weaker than the employed magnetic fields in this research (ca. 30 kG). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcription values between space grown Brassica rapa seedlings (A, #1) and static ground controls (B, #23) in the presence and absence of HGMFs show strong correlation (unity slope) and low scatter (R2 = 0.85 and 0.95), indicating no or low effect of magnetic fields on transcription. Panels (C) and (D) identify the examined tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The data sets use PFK as reference and show efficiency-corrected ΔCq and log(2) transformed values.These data indicate that factors other than HGMF induce curvature and the most likely factor is hydrotropism18,32,57. The lack of a gravity stimulus and the distance between the germination paper and the HGMF-generating wedges resulted in a large number of roots confined to the germination paper. The same factor also applied to seedlings in the magnetic chambers and resulted in reduced numbers of roots reaching the HGMF. However, the unambiguous evidence for curvature in space (see Sup. Video 1) and clinorotated seedlings (Sup. Video 2) indicates that HGMFs do have the ability to induce curvature as had been demonstrated earlier in roots, coleoptiles, inflorescences, and hypocotyls16,17,26,58,59. The presumably hydrotropic growth reduced the number of roots that reached the influence of the HGMFs. Therefore, the overall number of roots curving in response to the magnetic gradient was low (Table 2). Examining the gravisensing mechanism includes measuring the size of the presumptive sensors as previous work has shown that gravisensitivity depends on the amount of starch in amyloplasts60. Assuming equal density, the diameter of amyloplasts determines the relative mass. Measurements of amyloplasts in columella cells differed between the space-grown, clinorotated, and statically grown ground controls (Fig. 4) and indicates that the amyloplast size and therefore the gravisensing mechanism is responsive to the growth condition, notably weightlessness and clinorotation that respectively reduces and enhances mechanostimulation. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Size distribution of amyloplasts in the root cap of Brassica rapa seedlings grown in space, on the ground or in a clinostat. The data were compiled from 2 μm thick longitudinal sections of root cap tissue after fixation in paraformaldehyde. The difference between space and clinostat amyloplasts was highly significant (P < 10–4); the difference between static ground control and clinorotated amyloplasts was significant at the 5% level. Data were normalized based on 290, 243, and 210 amyloplast measurements for space, clinorotated, and static ground control plants, respectively.Earlier analyses of starch from space and ground controls found that ethylene reduces starch particle size and that in cotyledons starch particles sizes in space and ground controls were of equal size61. Since we used activated charcoal cloth to absorb volatile organic compounds (Fig. 1), we assume that ethylene was not a factor in the different experiments. In addition, we examined the size distribution of amyloplasts in the root columella. Earlier work showed that amyloplasts in gravisensing tissues (root cap and endodermis) are about twice the size of other tissues7. Our data (Fig. 4) indicate that the amyloplast size is responsive to the gravitational and mechanical stimulation. The reduced size after clinorotation, the average size in static 1-g controls, and the enlarged size in roots grown under ‘micro-gravity’ conditions support the notion that the extent of gravitational stimulation is inversely proportional to the mass of the amyloplasts. Thus, plants not only perceive the direction of an accelerative force but adjust their (starch) metabolism according to the amount of stimulation. If this concept is correct, then it should be supported by gene transcription data. The following analyses confirm that amylase activity indeed is affected by mechanostimulation. Transcript analyses Since four different tissue types were analyzed, tissue variability and response to spaceflight and clinorotation can be assessed for all examined tissues and genes. Based on distributions of transcription patterns (Figs. 3 and 5), a comprehensive analysis of all treatment and tissue combinations was performed such that the scatter for each comparison and gene was determined based on the formula ∑i=1n∑j=14Xij-Xj¯2+Yij-Yj¯2 where j represents the tissue types (root tip, root proper, hypocotyl, cotyledons) and i the individual experimental comparisons (28, Sup. Table 2) or examined genes (16). This value was calculated for each analyzed gene and the smallest value (scatter in Figs. 3 and 5) was identified as the most stably transcribed gene (Table 3). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Transcription values for space grown and clinorotated KSC ground controls. Brassica rapa seedlings (A, #2) show strong reduction of AMY1 transcription in clinorotated seedlings (circle). A comparison between static and clinorotated seedlings (B, #27) shows higher AMY1 transcription in non-clinorotated seedlings. Panels (C) and (D) identify the tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The circled data indicate AMY1 transcription relative to PFK. In both cases average AMY1 transcription was significantly different (p = 0.002, left and p < 0.001, right; n = 64). The data sets use PFK as reference and show efficiency-corrected ΔCq and log(2) transformed values.Table 3.

Table 2) are based on the percentage that resulted in the least scatter of all 448 combinations (16 genes by 28 comparisons).The distribution of the least variable gene transcription varied greatly (Table 3). Although common reference genes (e.g., TUB1, ACT7) are represented (Table 3), the observation that individual tissues differed in the genes of greatest stability and that the average of all tissues resulted in different assortments suggested that referring transcription data to the average of all measurements (i.e., the regression lines in Figs. 3 and 5) is superior to relying on a single gene. Because PFK showed the greatest stability for all tissues, we placed PFK at the origin of the coordinate system (0/0). However, the results explained below are independent of this selection. The comparisons (Sup. Table 2) show the least and most significant effect on gene expression and can be used to identify the conditions that induce physiological responses in brassica seedlings. The greatest stability in gene transcription was seen for treatments with similar mechanical load, for example, static growth with and without HGMF, or clinorotated samples (KSC and Lab). The largest scatter or least consistent transcription pattern was associated with different mechanical loads such as flight (i.e., no mechanical load) and clinorotation (enhanced mechanical load), or static and space flight conditions. The main conclusion of these evaluations is that HGMFs or more generally, strong magnetic fields, do not affect transcription; HGMF data are equally present in the most and least affected conditions (Table 4). However, a comparison between clinorotated experiments with the original flight hardware at KSC and experiments in our lab (comparison # 17 and # 22) show statistically significant differences (Sup. Fig. 4). Table 4.

Figs. 3 and 4). aNumbers refer to Sup. Table 2. Sensitivity of AMY1 Data sets comparing space-grown with clinorotated seedlings show large scatter and offset (Fig. 5A and Sup. Fig. 3A), suggesting that the shift in the transcription pattern is not dependent on HGMF but differences in mechanostimulation (i.e., clinorotation). This effect is especially noticeable for AMY1. The effect of clinorotation on amylase transcription is independent of the HGMF because transcription of AMY1 in the absence of HGMF was higher in static seedlings than clinorotated seedlings (Fig. 5B). Space flight and clinorotation resulted in reduced and elevated transcription, respectively. A similar pattern was observed between clinorotated and static samples; however, HGMF had no effect (Sup. Fig. 3). The altered AMY1 transcription between clinorotation at KSC and our lab is related to different stabilities of the hardware. The flight hardware contained a webbing-like base mount (implemented because of weight concerns), which provided stable support during space flight but flexed readily during clinorotation compared to a rigid assembly on the laboratory clinostat. The transcription data correspond with the observed size distribution of amyloplasts (Fig. 4) and indicate that amyloplast size is regulated by starch degradation in clinorotated seedlings and amylase repression (starch accumulation) in space samples. Together these observations indicate that plant adapt to the weightlessness of space by increasing their amyloplast size which likely enhances their gravisensitivity. In contrast, clinorotation represents excessive mechanostimulation and leads to a reduction of amyloplast size through enhanced degradation (amylase transcription). The observed AMY1 levels between space-grown and clinorotated seedlings were independent of reference genes; the effect persisted regardless of whatever gene was used as reference. This observation supports using transcription of all available genes as a reliable approach to identifying transcriptional changes of individual genes. The AMY1 data correspond to earlier observations of enhanced gravisensitivity of space-grown lentil seedlings62,63 and reduced starch after clinorotation64. Although the STS-107 flight experiment could not be retrieved to measure amyloplast size, the image analysis of flax seedlings indicated that the magnetic gradient had stronger effects than during previous ground experiments because the root curvature started at a greater distance from the HGMF-inducing wedge27 than during ground controls. This observation is in line with the present data and strongly supports greater (gravi)sensitivity of plants growing in a microgravity environment. The current report is the first to associate starch metabolism with amyloplasts size and gravisensitivity. The larger amyloplasts in space-grown plants suggest that the application of HGMFs in space is more effective than in earth-grown and especially in clinorotated plants. However, the unreliable growth direction of roots makes HGMF difficult to implement. Gravisensitivity has also been linked to changes in calcium in statocytes65–67 and calcium has been shown to stabilize α-amylase68–70. Therefore, Ca2+ and amylase are controlling element for the starch content in statocytes. However, starch content is the result of homeostasis for catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Starch biosynthesis depends on a complex set of enzymes that include phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)71, phosphoglucomutase (PGM)72,73, and starch synthases (SSs)71,74 among others. Data on the balance between starch degradation and starch biosynthesis undoubtedly would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of starch metabolism to reduced and enhanced mechanostimulation. However, the limited set of transcriptionally analyzed genes prevents a more thorough assessment of starch biosynthesis in response to altered mechanostimulation. Future space experiments might remedy this shortcoming. Genes other than AMY1 Although weightlessness is the dominant difference between ground and space flights, the lack of density-driven gas exchange and water distribution are equally significant alterations for plant growth in space. Because the flight hardware was enclosed in a hermetically sealed (triple-contained) chamber, atmospheric effects can be excluded. Therefore, the following considerations only apply to gravity effects. Comparing the number of significantly (P < 0.05) affected combinations (genes by reference), shows the largest effect on AMY1 transcription (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab The percentage of significant (P < 0.05) changes in gene transcription in response to space, HGMF and clinorotation of Brassica rapa seedlings. Compared to AMY1, all other genes showed fewer significant alterations (% of 16 genes × 16 references).Genes other than AMY1 responded to specific conditions but at reduced power. ACT7 showed modifications only when comparing clinorotation at KSC with static growth (Comparisons #19 & #20); ACT7 was not affected by HGMF but sensitive to vibrations (higher frequency movements in excess to the 1.5 rpm of the clinostat). This relationship is similar to the enhanced AMY1 transcription addressed in Sup. Fig. 4. The enhanced oscillation can be verified by the jitter in Sup. Video 2. To improve visibility, the individual frames were aligned, but the inconsistent position of imprinted data confirms the added vibrational stimulation that affected ACT7 activation (and enhanced AMY1 transcription) compared to regular (smooth) clinorotation. COX showed the strongest upregulation in space flight material compared with static growth conditions (#4, #5, #10 #11) but was not affected by HGMF. This observation further supports the claim that magnetic fields do not affect transcription. Instead, COX responds to space flight associated stress as has been shown previously for fish brain75 and skeletal muscle76. Changes in G6PDH5 were limited to treatment differences between space flight and clinorotation (#8, #12, #15, #16) and correspond to earlier reports of altered enzyme activities of pine seedlings after exposure to clinorotation and hyper-g77 and enzyme activities in artemia cysts after space flight78. IAA5 and PIN7 responded to HGMF both under flight (PIN7) and clinorotation (IAA5) and underscores their relevance for auxin modification of growth. Although the number of roots that curved in response to HGMF was low (Table 2), it is possible that differential growth (curvature in response to hydrotropism?) affected the transcription of these genes. GLK did not respond significantly; changes were not limited to any particular condition and therefore cannot be associated with specific experimental conditions but likely represent natural variations. UBq1, Tub1, ADH1, HXK, PFK, SUS, PIN1 showed no significant changes in transcription and therefore could all serve as references. The lack of response of ADH1 is surprising as this gene was previously identified as space stress indicator79,80. TAGL is the only gene that shows reduced transcription in the presence of magnetic fields but only in clinorotated samples. While there is precedence that the lipid metabolism is affected by hypergravity81 and clinorotation82, this is the first observation that magnetic fields might contribute to such changes. In summary, our data support plant proprioception of weightlessness and metabolic control of amyloplast size. The adjustment of size and mass of amyloplasts indicates that plants perceive gravity and ponderomotive forces, which provide not only enhanced gravisensitivity but also explain some metabolic responses to space conditions. The advantage of a sealed environment suggests that this effect is not an artefact but related to gravitational and mechanosensory responses. The results also demonstrate that HGMF do not influence gene transcription. Future work needs to investigate the role of other starch-related genes to understand the entire dynamic of metabolic plasticity that relates to weightlessness.",

Copyright notice ID: 9617909 PMID: 36309570 Abstract Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations. Subject terms: Biological techniques, Biophysics, Plant sciencesIntroduction The perception of the gravity stimulus and the involvement of amyloplasts have long been the focus of plant biology because of the cryptic nature of essential steps in the response of a biological system to physical stimuli such as gravity1–4. While the first step of the gravitropic response primarily depends on the interaction of intracellular particles with Earth’s gravitational field, the ability to respond to the gravity signal depends on biological conditions such as auxin sensitivity and transport5, time6,7, the cytoskeleton8 and physical parameters such as temperature9, orientation10,11, osmotic conditions12, mechanical noise13, cytoplasmic viscosity14, and high-gradient magnetic fields15–17. The redundancy contributes to the stability of the graviresponse system and can integrate additional signals such as hydrotropism18,19 and touch20,21. Because any physiological response is a function of the accumulated signal (auxin, altered gene expression, pH, ion, or charge shifts), control of the response shifts from the original signal to downstream events such as signal processing (translation) and response variables that are related to signal strength and persistence22. Therefore, the analysis of mechano-sensing and (gravi)response depends on the elimination of the gravity effects by experimenting under weightlessness conditions in space. The study of HGMF on amyloplast movements was attempted in ground studies15,23–26 and was the focus of a shuttle experiment in 2003 (STS-107)27. However, the disintegration of the Shuttle during reentry made the intended analyses impossible. Nonetheless, this experiment provided strong evidence that mechano-sensitivity increased in microgravity27. Here we report data from a space experiment on the Space-X Crew Resupply Service 3 mission. The aim of this investigation was to repeat the ill-fated experiment on STS-107. However, instead of flax (Linum usitatissimum) we used Brassica rapa seeds to study the effect of magnetic gradients and to take advantage of its Arabidopsis-related genome to assess transcriptional responses of genes related to growth, metabolism, auxin, and stress. Because of the dual effort to characterize the effect of HGMF and transcriptional analysis the remainder of the introduction covers separately each aspect. HGMF Induction of curvature by magneto-mechanical forces depends on the magnetic susceptibility (ϰ), which is characteristic of a given substance and describes its ability to acquire magnetization I as a result of the (inducing) magnetic field H such that I = ϰH. Diamagnetic substances have negative susceptibility and include the vast majority of biological substances. However, some metal-containing proteins such as hemoglobin, cytochrome, ferritin etc., can have positive susceptibility and are paramagnetic26,28,29. The magnetic susceptibility of dia- and paramagnetic compounds is proportional to their density and their behavior in a magnetic gradient is analogous to that in the gravity field16,24,26. Magnetic susceptibility and density of the cytoplasm are equal to that of water, ϰ w = 7.2 × 10–7 emu (electromagnetic units, table value), and that of starch ϰst = (8 ± 0.2) × 10–7, thus the differential susceptibility between starch and cytoplasm Δϰ ≈ 8 × 10–8 emu. The density of starch ρst = 1.5 g/cm3, and cytoplasm ~ 1 g/cm3; therefore Δρ = 0.5 g/cm3 and Δp/Δ ϰ ≈ − 6 × 106 (g/cm3)/emu26. Although other methods of generating HGMF are available24,26, the generation of a magnetic gradient in the experiments described here, was realized by inserting into a uniform, strong magnetic field ferromagnetic wedges. The wedges become magnetized and create a HGMF (Fig. 1) such that the gradient ∇H is directed toward the tip of the wedge. Therefore, the force acting on a diamagnetic body (ϰ < 0) repels starch-filled amyloplasts from the inserted object. In contrast, a para- or ferromagnetic body (ϰ > 0) would experience an attractive force. The force generated by the HGMF utilized in the employed setup has been determined previously to be about 0.6 g30 and exceeds the acceleration that plants respond to (about 10–3 g31). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The design of the magnetic field chamber (MFC) with 10 magnets arranged in two stories with a total of eight compartments. The magnetic field was contained with two ferromagnetic yokes. Each compartment contained two ferromagnetic wedges and two pieces of activated charcoal cloth (ACC), and one seed cassette each. The diagram on the upper right shows the distortion of the magnetic field by the wedges (applicable to all compartments) and the projected growth of the seedling roots. The flow path of the fixative from a single fill port (F) to the drain port (D) is shown as white canals for front-visible paths; connections on the rear side between the individual compartments are shown as dark lines.In contrast to cultivation on earth where orienting factors are provided by gravity as constant and light as intermittent influence, plant growth in space cannot rely on gravitational clues; it depends on the plants’ (intermittent) phototropic response. However, in the absence of light, especially root elongation is variable, and orientation responds mostly to water gradients (hydrotropism)19,32. Removing the two most consequential vectors for plant orientation, i.e., growing plants under weightlessness conditions in the dark, provides an opportunity to examine the role of amyloplasts for directional growth analogous to their role in gravity sensing. Probing magnetophoretic effects and the space conditions on root growth was the objective for the experiment described here. The investigation included transcription analyses of 16 genes that represent auxin effects (IAA5, PIN 1, 3, 7) as the main growth regulator of differential elongation33–35, starch katabolism (Amy1)36, sucrose synthase (SUS, cell wall formation)37, UBQ1 (ubiquitin1; a putative reference38 and indicator of protein metabolism)39, TUB1 (tubulin1; reference38, cell growth, mitosis), ACT7 (actin7; putative reference40, root growth and germination41), ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase; stress response42), COX (cytochrome oxidase subunit1; metabolism, stress43), G6PDH5 (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase5; oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, basic metabolism44), GLK (glucokinase; carbohydrate metabolism45) HXK (hexokinase 1; glucose metabolism and developmental regulator46), PFK (phosphofructokinase; carbohydrate metabolism, hypoxia stress47), and TAGL (triacylglycerol lipase; lipid metabolism48,49). The transcription pattern of these genes under conditions such as space (weightlessness), clinorotation (enhanced mechanostimulation), and static controls provided information on how seedlings respond to the respective conditions. This report describes an experiment that built on prior experience (i.e., Biotube1 on STS-107) but used genetically better-characterized plant material, Brassica rapa. Our data support HGMFs as suitable method to establish plant orientation in space but also show that mechanostimulation affects gravisensing-related metabolism. The report demonstrates that plants perceive weightlessness (“micro-gravity”) and respond by enhanced starch production in gravity perceiving cells.Material and methods Plant material Brassica rapa, var. rapa seeds were commercially sourced. No approvals were required for the study, which complied with all relevant regulations. Seeds were attached to germination paper with polyvinyl acetate (clear Elmer’s) glue such that the micropyle was oriented toward the opening of seed cassettes (Sup. Fig. 1). The seeds cassettes were designed to fit into specially designed magnetic field chambers (MFCs, Fig. 1).Experimental setup The experiment was a follow-up of the STS-107 experiment that was lost as a result of the shuttle accident in 2003. A computer (PC104 stack) controlled all aspects and was remotely operated such that no crew involvement was necessary. The experimental principle of the hardware (Fig. 1) and the arrangement of the components is shown in Sup. Fig. 2. Experiment initialization, water dispensation, image acquisition, temperature and pressure recording, and termination of the experiment by fixation were remotely initiated and controlled by the hardware’s own computer. The entire hardware was custom built at the Kennedy Space Center using several iterations and named Biotube-MICRo (Magnetic Induction of Curvature in Roots).Hardware The MFCs consisted of machined aluminum cases each containing 10 Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnets, 12.7 mm thick with a magnetization of about 30,000 Oe (~ 3 Tesla, Magnet Sales and Manufacturing, Culver City, CA). The magnetic circuit was closed by two yokes. To the surface of each magnet, two wedges of ferromagnetic steel (equilateral cross section, 6 mm high, 50 mm long) were attached that generated the magnetic gradients (Fig. 1). Between each pair of magnets seed cassettes were inserted that contained 10 Brassica rapa seeds. Five seeds each were glued (Elmer’s clear glue) along the long edges of germination paper. Roots that emerged from the seed cassettes were expected to curve away from the wedges. A camera system consisting of eight cameras on either side was installed between two of the three MFCs such that the cameras were positioned opposite a window that permitted viewing the seed cassettes. Illumination was achieved by a single IR LED (750–800 nm) to avoid phototropic stimulation. The LEDs were activated only during imaging. The cameras acquired images in two-minute intervals and the video signal together with temperature, and atmospheric pressure data and position number were transmitted to the Kennedy Space Center (Florida) as well as recorded internally on a hard drive.Space flight parameters The experiment was launched on Space-X3 (April 18, 2014) and initiated after 19 days by dispensing 400 μL deionized water to each seed cassette from a Micro Effusion Device for Space Applications (MEDUSA). The seeds germinated after about 22 h. The experiment was terminated after 48 h by the injection of RNA-Later® into MFC-C (first in the fixation sequence, not imaged), injection of 4% formaldehyde in PHEMD buffer50 in MFC-A (image sequences designated ‘Y’). MFC-B received RNALater, was designated ‘Z’ and third in the fixation sequence. MFC-C did not contain magnets but Al blocks of identical dimensions as the magnets and served as control. The dispensation of the respective fixative was initiated by pressurizing an aluminum chamber that contained sealed bags with fixative, one for each MFC. A solenoid valve controlled fixative flow to one MFC at a time. Excess liquid was collected in a second bag housed in a plastic cage. The entire hardware and fixed plant material deorbited on May 20, 2014. After 2 days the hardware was received at the Kennedy Space Center, and sample processing was completed during the next 3 days. A ground control using the space hardware was performed at the Kennedy Space Center on a large clinostat (8/12–8/15/14, 1.5 rpm) and at the University of Louisiana using single clinorotated MFCs without imaging but under otherwise identical conditions.Data analysis Image sequences were obtained from HD-stored files and compiled as video sequences (Sup. Video 1 and Sup. Video 2). Root curvature was recorded from seed cassettes that were submersed in the same buffer as during fixation in an upright position and photographed from four sides. After disassembly of the seed cassettes, root appearance was categorized as germinated, straight, or curved. Curvature was evaluated as affected by HGMF only if the root length was sufficient to reach the HGMF area and corresponding curvature was visible. Only roots that were exposed to HGMF were used for the transcriptome analysis. Microscopy was performed on seedlings fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PHEMD buffer50. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and 100% acetone and embedded in Spurr’s resin. Longitudinal median sections (2 μm thick) were cut on an ultra-microtome (Sorvall MT2-B) and stained with toluidine blue (0.1% [w/v] in 0.1% [w/v] boric acid). The serial sections were photographed with a digital camera (Sony DKC-ST5) and measured using ImageJ (v.1.53). RNA extraction was performed in four separate sections of seedlings (root tip, root proper, hypocotyl, and cotyledons) using a kit (Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit, Sigma STRN250) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Transcription analysis was performed after reverse transcription (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) and qPCR reactions for 16 different genes using specific primers, with stable and suitable efficiencies (Sup. Table 1). Conditions for the amplification on a Step-one real-time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific) included a 2 min incubation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles (95 °C for 10 s; 60 °C for 10 s) with fluorescent readings taken at the end of the annealing cycle. Quality control included melt curve analyses and capillary electrophoresis (QIAxcel Advanced). The assessment of the space environment on seedling biology was examined using qPCR data of 16 genes. Typically, qPCR data rely on so-called reference or housekeeping genes, but this approach does not consider that the environmental conditions (space flight, clinorotation, and static growth conditions) are likely to affect reference genes themselves. Therefore, we compared the entire data sets against each other based on all studied conditions. If no difference exists between the two data sets, then such plots result in a diagonal line with a slope of one. The evaluation based on slope and variance (R2 value) as indicator of overall stability of gene activity also provides information on significantly affected genes. Such data points will show up as ‘outliers’ from the bulk distribution51. This approach was evaluated based on four individual tissues of the seedlings, resulting in 64 data points (16 genes × 4 tissue types), for each treatment. The most relevant comparison of the explained type focuses on the effect of weightlessness and HGMFs in addition to the effect of clinorotation and static, 1 g controls. The complete set of comparisons is provided as Sup. Table 2. Transcription data were evaluated based on correspondence plots of pairwise comparisons. Significant changes in transcriptions were evaluated by the Mean Method51, and statistical significance was based on Z-scores.Results and discussion Growth and seedling development Each MFC contained eight seed cassettes with ten seeds each. Seed germination in the two MFCs with HGMFs was higher than in the non-magnetic chamber (Table 1), indicating that the presence of magnets and magnetic fields did not negatively affect germination.

Video 1, Table 2). However, substantial curvature occurred in both presence and absence of magnetic gradients. The non-magnetic chamber showed 81% curvature in roots within the seed cassette around the germination paper (Fig. 2). Table 2.

Open in a new tab Example of root orientation inside seed cassettes. The predominant curvature and elongation occurred onto and along the surface of the germination paper.MFCs with magnets showed curvature that was independent of the HGMF because of growth patterns or curvature occurring inside the seed cassettes where the magnetic gradient was too weak to affect curvature. The comparison of space-grown or static ground control seedlings exposed to HGMF with seedlings grown in the non-magnetic field chamber (#1 and #23 in Sup. Table 2) shows strong correspondence between the two conditions (Fig. 3), indicating that magnetic fields do not affect general metabolism or transcription activity. This notion is in line with reports that failed to detect effects of magnetic fields on growth52,53 but contrasts with effects of weak magnetic fields on root curvature54 and effects of the geomagnetic field on stress response and hormesis55,56. The geomagnetic field (typically about 0.5 G) is orders of magnitude weaker than the employed magnetic fields in this research (ca. 30 kG). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcription values between space grown Brassica rapa seedlings (A, #1) and static ground controls (B, #23) in the presence and absence of HGMFs show strong correlation (unity slope) and low scatter (R2 = 0.85 and 0.95), indicating no or low effect of magnetic fields on transcription. Panels (C) and (D) identify the examined tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The data sets use PFK as reference and show efficiency-corrected ΔCq and log(2) transformed values.These data indicate that factors other than HGMF induce curvature and the most likely factor is hydrotropism18,32,57. The lack of a gravity stimulus and the distance between the germination paper and the HGMF-generating wedges resulted in a large number of roots confined to the germination paper. The same factor also applied to seedlings in the magnetic chambers and resulted in reduced numbers of roots reaching the HGMF. However, the unambiguous evidence for curvature in space (see Sup. Video 1) and clinorotated seedlings (Sup. Video 2) indicates that HGMFs do have the ability to induce curvature as had been demonstrated earlier in roots, coleoptiles, inflorescences, and hypocotyls16,17,26,58,59. The presumably hydrotropic growth reduced the number of roots that reached the influence of the HGMFs. Therefore, the overall number of roots curving in response to the magnetic gradient was low (Table 2). Examining the gravisensing mechanism includes measuring the size of the presumptive sensors as previous work has shown that gravisensitivity depends on the amount of starch in amyloplasts60. Assuming equal density, the diameter of amyloplasts determines the relative mass. Measurements of amyloplasts in columella cells differed between the space-grown, clinorotated, and statically grown ground controls (Fig. 4) and indicates that the amyloplast size and therefore the gravisensing mechanism is responsive to the growth condition, notably weightlessness and clinorotation that respectively reduces and enhances mechanostimulation. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Size distribution of amyloplasts in the root cap of Brassica rapa seedlings grown in space, on the ground or in a clinostat. The data were compiled from 2 μm thick longitudinal sections of root cap tissue after fixation in paraformaldehyde. The difference between space and clinostat amyloplasts was highly significant (P < 10–4); the difference between static ground control and clinorotated amyloplasts was significant at the 5% level. Data were normalized based on 290, 243, and 210 amyloplast measurements for space, clinorotated, and static ground control plants, respectively.Earlier analyses of starch from space and ground controls found that ethylene reduces starch particle size and that in cotyledons starch particles sizes in space and ground controls were of equal size61. Since we used activated charcoal cloth to absorb volatile organic compounds (Fig. 1), we assume that ethylene was not a factor in the different experiments. In addition, we examined the size distribution of amyloplasts in the root columella. Earlier work showed that amyloplasts in gravisensing tissues (root cap and endodermis) are about twice the size of other tissues7. Our data (Fig. 4) indicate that the amyloplast size is responsive to the gravitational and mechanical stimulation. The reduced size after clinorotation, the average size in static 1-g controls, and the enlarged size in roots grown under ‘micro-gravity’ conditions support the notion that the extent of gravitational stimulation is inversely proportional to the mass of the amyloplasts. Thus, plants not only perceive the direction of an accelerative force but adjust their (starch) metabolism according to the amount of stimulation. If this concept is correct, then it should be supported by gene transcription data. The following analyses confirm that amylase activity indeed is affected by mechanostimulation.Transcript analyses Since four different tissue types were analyzed, tissue variability and response to spaceflight and clinorotation can be assessed for all examined tissues and genes. Based on distributions of transcription patterns (Figs. 3 and 5), a comprehensive analysis of all treatment and tissue combinations was performed such that the scatter for each comparison and gene was determined based on the formula ∑i=1n∑j=14Xij-Xj¯2+Yij-Yj¯2 where j represents the tissue types (root tip, root proper, hypocotyl, cotyledons) and i the individual experimental comparisons (28, Sup. Table 2) or examined genes (16). This value was calculated for each analyzed gene and the smallest value (scatter in Figs. 3 and 5) was identified as the most stably transcribed gene (Table 3). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Transcription values for space grown and clinorotated KSC ground controls. Brassica rapa seedlings (A, #2) show strong reduction of AMY1 transcription in clinorotated seedlings (circle). A comparison between static and clinorotated seedlings (B, #27) shows higher AMY1 transcription in non-clinorotated seedlings. Panels (C) and (D) identify the tissues in (A) and (B), respectively. The circled data indicate AMY1 transcription relative to PFK. In both cases average AMY1 transcription was significantly different (p = 0.002, left and p < 0.001, right; n = 64). The data sets use PFK as reference and show efficiency-corrected ΔCq and log(2) transformed values.Table 3.

Table 2) are based on the percentage that resulted in the least scatter of all 448 combinations (16 genes by 28 comparisons).The distribution of the least variable gene transcription varied greatly (Table 3). Although common reference genes (e.g., TUB1, ACT7) are represented (Table 3), the observation that individual tissues differed in the genes of greatest stability and that the average of all tissues resulted in different assortments suggested that referring transcription data to the average of all measurements (i.e., the regression lines in Figs. 3 and 5) is superior to relying on a single gene. Because PFK showed the greatest stability for all tissues, we placed PFK at the origin of the coordinate system (0/0). However, the results explained below are independent of this selection. The comparisons (Sup. Table 2) show the least and most significant effect on gene expression and can be used to identify the conditions that induce physiological responses in brassica seedlings. The greatest stability in gene transcription was seen for treatments with similar mechanical load, for example, static growth with and without HGMF, or clinorotated samples (KSC and Lab). The largest scatter or least consistent transcription pattern was associated with different mechanical loads such as flight (i.e., no mechanical load) and clinorotation (enhanced mechanical load), or static and space flight conditions. The main conclusion of these evaluations is that HGMFs or more generally, strong magnetic fields, do not affect transcription; HGMF data are equally present in the most and least affected conditions (Table 4). However, a comparison between clinorotated experiments with the original flight hardware at KSC and experiments in our lab (comparison # 17 and # 22) show statistically significant differences (Sup. Fig. 4). Table 4.

Figs. 3 and 4). aNumbers refer to Sup. Table 2. Sensitivity of AMY1 Data sets comparing space-grown with clinorotated seedlings show large scatter and offset (Fig. 5A and Sup. Fig. 3A), suggesting that the shift in the transcription pattern is not dependent on HGMF but differences in mechanostimulation (i.e., clinorotation). This effect is especially noticeable for AMY1. The effect of clinorotation on amylase transcription is independent of the HGMF because transcription of AMY1 in the absence of HGMF was higher in static seedlings than clinorotated seedlings (Fig. 5B). Space flight and clinorotation resulted in reduced and elevated transcription, respectively. A similar pattern was observed between clinorotated and static samples; however, HGMF had no effect (Sup. Fig. 3). The altered AMY1 transcription between clinorotation at KSC and our lab is related to different stabilities of the hardware. The flight hardware contained a webbing-like base mount (implemented because of weight concerns), which provided stable support during space flight but flexed readily during clinorotation compared to a rigid assembly on the laboratory clinostat. The transcription data correspond with the observed size distribution of amyloplasts (Fig. 4) and indicate that amyloplast size is regulated by starch degradation in clinorotated seedlings and amylase repression (starch accumulation) in space samples. Together these observations indicate that plant adapt to the weightlessness of space by increasing their amyloplast size which likely enhances their gravisensitivity. In contrast, clinorotation represents excessive mechanostimulation and leads to a reduction of amyloplast size through enhanced degradation (amylase transcription). The observed AMY1 levels between space-grown and clinorotated seedlings were independent of reference genes; the effect persisted regardless of whatever gene was used as reference. This observation supports using transcription of all available genes as a reliable approach to identifying transcriptional changes of individual genes. The AMY1 data correspond to earlier observations of enhanced gravisensitivity of space-grown lentil seedlings62,63 and reduced starch after clinorotation64. Although the STS-107 flight experiment could not be retrieved to measure amyloplast size, the image analysis of flax seedlings indicated that the magnetic gradient had stronger effects than during previous ground experiments because the root curvature started at a greater distance from the HGMF-inducing wedge27 than during ground controls. This observation is in line with the present data and strongly supports greater (gravi)sensitivity of plants growing in a microgravity environment. The current report is the first to associate starch metabolism with amyloplasts size and gravisensitivity. The larger amyloplasts in space-grown plants suggest that the application of HGMFs in space is more effective than in earth-grown and especially in clinorotated plants. However, the unreliable growth direction of roots makes HGMF difficult to implement. Gravisensitivity has also been linked to changes in calcium in statocytes65–67 and calcium has been shown to stabilize α-amylase68–70. Therefore, Ca2+ and amylase are controlling element for the starch content in statocytes. However, starch content is the result of homeostasis for catabolic and anabolic metabolism. Starch biosynthesis depends on a complex set of enzymes that include phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)71, phosphoglucomutase (PGM)72,73, and starch synthases (SSs)71,74 among others. Data on the balance between starch degradation and starch biosynthesis undoubtedly would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of starch metabolism to reduced and enhanced mechanostimulation. However, the limited set of transcriptionally analyzed genes prevents a more thorough assessment of starch biosynthesis in response to altered mechanostimulation. Future space experiments might remedy this shortcoming.Genes other than AMY1 Although weightlessness is the dominant difference between ground and space flights, the lack of density-driven gas exchange and water distribution are equally significant alterations for plant growth in space. Because the flight hardware was enclosed in a hermetically sealed (triple-contained) chamber, atmospheric effects can be excluded. Therefore, the following considerations only apply to gravity effects. Comparing the number of significantly (P < 0.05) affected combinations (genes by reference), shows the largest effect on AMY1 transcription (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab The percentage of significant (P < 0.05) changes in gene transcription in response to space, HGMF and clinorotation of Brassica rapa seedlings. Compared to AMY1, all other genes showed fewer significant alterations (% of 16 genes × 16 references).Genes other than AMY1 responded to specific conditions but at reduced power. ACT7 showed modifications only when comparing clinorotation at KSC with static growth (Comparisons #19 & #20); ACT7 was not affected by HGMF but sensitive to vibrations (higher frequency movements in excess to the 1.5 rpm of the clinostat). This relationship is similar to the enhanced AMY1 transcription addressed in Sup. Fig. 4. The enhanced oscillation can be verified by the jitter in Sup. Video 2. To improve visibility, the individual frames were aligned, but the inconsistent position of imprinted data confirms the added vibrational stimulation that affected ACT7 activation (and enhanced AMY1 transcription) compared to regular (smooth) clinorotation. COX showed the strongest upregulation in space flight material compared with static growth conditions (#4, #5, #10 #11) but was not affected by HGMF. This observation further supports the claim that magnetic fields do not affect transcription. Instead, COX responds to space flight associated stress as has been shown previously for fish brain75 and skeletal muscle76. Changes in G6PDH5 were limited to treatment differences between space flight and clinorotation (#8, #12, #15, #16) and correspond to earlier reports of altered enzyme activities of pine seedlings after exposure to clinorotation and hyper-g77 and enzyme activities in artemia cysts after space flight78. IAA5 and PIN7 responded to HGMF both under flight (PIN7) and clinorotation (IAA5) and underscores their relevance for auxin modification of growth. Although the number of roots that curved in response to HGMF was low (Table 2), it is possible that differential growth (curvature in response to hydrotropism?) affected the transcription of these genes. GLK did not respond significantly; changes were not limited to any particular condition and therefore cannot be associated with specific experimental conditions but likely represent natural variations. UBq1, Tub1, ADH1, HXK, PFK, SUS, PIN1 showed no significant changes in transcription and therefore could all serve as references. The lack of response of ADH1 is surprising as this gene was previously identified as space stress indicator79,80. TAGL is the only gene that shows reduced transcription in the presence of magnetic fields but only in clinorotated samples. While there is precedence that the lipid metabolism is affected by hypergravity81 and clinorotation82, this is the first observation that magnetic fields might contribute to such changes. In summary, our data support plant proprioception of weightlessness and metabolic control of amyloplast size. The adjustment of size and mass of amyloplasts indicates that plants perceive gravity and ponderomotive forces, which provide not only enhanced gravisensitivity but also explain some metabolic responses to space conditions. The advantage of a sealed environment suggests that this effect is not an artefact but related to gravitational and mechanosensory responses. The results also demonstrate that HGMF do not influence gene transcription. Future work needs to investigate the role of other starch-related genes to understand the entire dynamic of metabolic plasticity that relates to weightlessness.Supplementary Information Supplementary Video 1.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Our understanding of microgravity’s effects on living systems, including plants, improves as the result of better methods and novel technologies but also by using specific (plant) species. Examining increasingly complex interactions between specific plant responses and environmental conditions elucidates the complex effects of gravity on plants and their response to weightlessness. The realization that plants must be a component of Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) focused on plant productivity and the identification of the most suitable species for space cultivation [1,2]. Plant functionality during long-term space missions includes the responses to elevated CO2, the hydrolysis of water, oxygen generation, possibly hydrogen as generic fuel, and the recycling of water. However, the provision of edible biomass is certainly the most sought-after benefit of plant growth in space [3,4,5,6]. Human explorations of the Moon or Mars are impossible without BLSSs as the reduction in resources (water, food, and oxygen), achievable with BLSSs, is essential because of energy requirements for food transport, stowage, as well as the additional mass of packaging, which makes in situ food production and BLSSs essential for long-term space exploration. Additional criteria for in situ food production are logistical and space- and energy-saving measures. The degradation of food during long-term storage and the required volume can only be solved by means of preparing fresh food. The focus on BLSSs is different from fundamental biological questions of the effect of weightlessness on plant physiology. From the earliest to current space experiments, the effects of weightlessness were the focus of much basic research that included considerations of cellular structures, such as the organization of cells, responses of the cytoskeleton and metabolism, stress responses, and differential gene expressions between space experiments and ground controls [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Despite the fact that biological membranes, notably the cell membrane (CM), are most sensitive to altered gravity [17], there are few published data on the effect of microgravity on their physicochemical properties. The CM is one of the most dynamic supra-molecular structures in a cell, as it is the link between the cytoplasm and the extracellular matrix. It participates in numerous basic cell processes such as the transport of metabolites and ions, cell signaling, endocytosis, cell division and differentiation, and defense from pathogens [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The ability of plants to remodel membrane lipids and protein composition plays a crucial role in the adaptation to stress and environmental changes, including altering temperature, drought, salinity, and heavy metals [24]. The involvement of CM in gravisensing has been demonstrated initially by the formation of complex and diverse pattern folds in the green alga Chlorella vulgaris in space flight in comparison with ground control [25]. The appearance of CM folds of a complicated configuration during space flight was suggested to associate with enhanced metabolism and endo- and exocytosis. Hanke [26] used planar lipid bilayers with alamethicin-induced pores to demonstrate the dependence of conductivity relative to the gravity vector. The influence of gravity has been confirmed in genuine biological membranes of E. coli [27]. The gravity dependence of the viscosity of artificial and cell membranes was demonstrated during parabolic flights by means of fluorescence polarization microscopy [28]. Similarly, changes in the composition of phospholipids, fatty acids, and sterols in the CM of clinorotated pea seedlings have been reported [29,30,31] and prompted the hypothesis of gravitational decompensation, which postulates that the surface tension of the membrane under microgravity conditions can induce changes that are enhanced by the heterogeneity of the membrane. Thus, alteration in the physicochemical properties of the membrane leads to changes in the permeability and ion transport activity of membrane-bound channels, followed by adjustments of metabolism and eventually physiological responses [32]. The presence of functional microdomains with specific localization and lipids and protein composition in the CM became known as “membrane microdomains” or “detergent-resistant membranes” (DRMs). However, the most common name is “lipid rafts” with the distinction of rafts, clustered rafts, DRMPs, and Caveolae [33]. The formation of ordered domains was linked to the behavior of DRMs in liposomes and cells [34]. Upon stimulation, rafts may cluster to form larger structures, i.e., temporally and spatially organize functionally different protein complexes, that improve the synchronization and specificity of cellular responses [33]. The functional significance of lipid rafts, their dynamic assembly, and the enrichment of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated fatty acids affect membrane trafficking and signaling. Thus, lipid rafts take part in many vitally important cell processes [20,23,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. The concept of cholesterol clustering helps explain its effect on membrane fluidity via the formation of ordered domains and changed membrane deformation by altered protein interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton, and the formation and stabilization of lipid–protein assemblies [43]. The main function of sphingolipids is their involvement in signal transmission from the outer to the inner membrane surface. This function depends on various lipophilic (ceramide) or hydrophilic (carbohydrate) attachments, which determine the extent of the interaction of the lipid bilayer with the polar environment. Sphingolipids are localized on the outer membrane surface, and the specificity is determined by the attached carbohydrate moiety [44,45,46]. Lipid rafts explain the biochemical processes of the cell membrane under normal and stress conditions that cannot be explained otherwise. The increased cholesterol and saturated fatty acid content of the raft fraction in clinorotated pea seedling root membranes indicated raft sensitivity to clinorotation [47]. The aim of this review is to assess available data on plant lipid rafts as possible triggers of changes in cell activities in response to changes in mechanical stimulation and unloading.",

The aim of this review is to assess available data on plant lipid rafts as possible triggers of changes in cell activities in response to changes in mechanical stimulation and unloading.2. Lipid Rafts in Plants Basic information on the structure, composition, and functions of lipid rafts in the CM was obtained in studies of the membranes of animal and yeast cells. Later, data on the presence of microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and nonionic detergent insoluble in domains, similar to the lipid rafts of mammalian cells, were reported in plants [40,41,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57]. Lipid rafts were documented in the CM isolated from Nicotiana tabacum leaves and BY2 cell cultures [38,39,48,51,58]. Microdomains have sizes in the range of 100–400 nm and often contain aggregated protein complexes. Six proteins of 22, 28, 35, 60, 67, and 94 kDa anchored to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) were detected [48]. Based on one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting, DRMs were shown to be highly enriched in glucosylceramide and in a mixture of phytosterols—stigmasterol, sitosterol, 24-methylcholesterol, and cholesterol—compared with the CM from which they were isolated [38,39]. Phospho- and glycoglycerolipids were detected in lipid rafts in small quantities. The role of plant rafts, defined as the sterol-dependent ordered assemblies of specific lipids and proteins in plant CM as a signaling entity is based on their ability to recruit specific membrane proteins that elicit specific signaling and responses to biotic and abiotic stress, cellular trafficking, and cell wall metabolism [39,51,59]. The enrichment of microdomains with polyphosphoinositides and saturated fatty acids also suggests lipid raft involvement in cell signaling [58]. Similarly, DRMs isolated from the CM of Arabidopsis thaliana callus, A. thaliana, and Allium porrum leaves were enriched in sterols and sphingolipids 4–5-fold in comparison with the entire CM, sterylglucosides, and glucosylceramides and were depleted in glycerophospholipids [49,53]. Microdomains from A. thaliana cotyledons were enriched with specific signaling components, particularly with seven receptor kinases with leucine-rich repeats, 10 other kinases, the β subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, and five other GTP-binding proteins [60]. Sterol-dependent proteins associated with rafts comprise part of the membrane-bound ABA signaling system in A. thaliana leaves, in particular, phosphatase ABI1 (a negative regulator of ABA signaling) and calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 [61]. The glycoprotein At-FLA 4 (fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 4) positively regulates the biosynthesis of cell wall components and normal root growth through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway. Fasciclins are normally associated with the outer surface of lipid rafts in the CM via glucosylphosphatidylinositol [62]. In the CM of Medicago trunculata, lipid rafts were structurally identified as small (40–120 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic domains enriched in sterols and sphingolipids. Small rafts can sometimes form larger units through protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions. A specific set of proteins, including the presence of a redox system around cytochrome B561, was found in rafts isolated from the root CM. Likely, the redox system is involved in the symbiotic interaction between legumes and symbionts [52,63]. The involvement of Bax inhibitor (BI-1), which is a suppressor of apoptosis, in sphingolipids metabolism suggests a regulatory mechanism of rafts for cell death. BI-1 overexpression inhibits stress-induced cell death by decreasing the abundance of a set of key proteins. The influence of BI-1 on cell death-associated components in sphingolipid-enriched microdomains of the Oryza sativa CM suggests a novel, biological implication of plant lipid rafts in stress-induced cell death [64]. Higher proportions of sterols, sphingolipids, and saturated phospholipids were also detected in the microdomains of Avena sativa and Secale cereale in comparison with those in the CM [65]. Numerous proteins were identified as DRM proteins in these species. The physicochemical properties of the proteins and the unique distribution of proteins in the DRMs may control the functions of the domains in the CM for various physiological processes [66]. The involvement of lipid rafts and apoplastic transport through plasmodesmata is likely controlled by callose, which is synthesized by callose synthases and degraded by β-1,3 glucanases. The proximity of callose-modifying glycosylphosphatidylinositol proteins at plasmodesmata may depend on and be stabilized by sterols [67]. Thus, lipid rafts may affect callose accumulation in plasmodesmata and participate in the maintenance of plasmodesmal ultrastructure, callose deposition, and signaling. Therefore, lipid rafts may affect the function of plasmodesmata [68,69]. CM lipids of the cell suspension cultures of Populus trichocarpa are enriched in proteins of functional categories such as transport, signal transduction, responses to abiotic and biotic stress, and the biosynthesis of callose. It is especially interesting and important to note that microdomains are enriched with ABC transporters, aquaporins, sugar, metal, organic solute transporters, and ATPases, as well as phospholipase D and diacylglycerol kinases. These enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidic acid [70], which regulates and amplifies many cellular signaling pathways and functions, as well as in membrane arrangement [71]. The role of lipid rafts in the protective mechanisms under various stresses has been shown for cold stress in A. thaliana [72]. P-type H+ATPases, aquaporins, and endocytosis-related proteins increased and, conversely, tubulins, actins, and V-type H+-ATPase subunits decreased in DRMs during cold acclimation. The functional categorization of cold-responsive proteins in DRMs supports the notion that plant CM microdomains affect membrane transport and cytoskeleton interactions in Avena sativa and Secale cereale [65], drought, and salinity in Brassica oleracea L. var italica [73] and iron deficiency in Beta vulgaris [74]. A close relationship between Gossypium hirsutum cv. Jimian 14 fiber cell development and cell membrane lipid organization and lipid raft activity were illustrated by di-4-ANEPPDHQ-labeled fibers [75]. The raft-specific lipids enriched with cerebrosides and sterols in the halophytes Artemisia santonica and Salicornia perennans indicate the participation of rafts in salt resistance [76]. In addition, a study of the lipid raft fraction from pea seedling root CM after clinorotation showed significantly increased cholesterol and saturated fatty acids [47], which will be illustrated in more detail below.3. Lipid Rafts under Clinorotation Lipid rafts from the root CM of pea seedlings grown in stationary conditions and under slow horizontal clinorotation (2 rpm) have the appearance of thin tapes of 80–100 nm in length and 6–13 nm in width (Figure 1); they were similar to those in other plant species in structure and size and also enriched with cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Raft fraction isolated the root CM of 6-day-old pea seedlings (transmission electron microscopy). Arrows point to rafts [47].Under stationary conditions, saturated fatty acids prevailed in the lipid raft fraction (64.5%) vs. 43.5% in the static CM. In clinorotated fractions, the percentages of the monoenoic and polyenoic fatty acids were 6.5% and 29%, respectively, and the content of saturated fatty acids increased (66.7%), monoenoic fatty acids decreased (5.2%), while the content of polyenoic fatty acids remained unchanged (28.2%). The content of cholesterol increased about seven times under clinorotation compared to the control, but the content of other sterols remained unchanged (Figure 2) [47]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data on the sterol content in the raft fractions isolated from the root CM of six-day-old pea seedlings grown statically (control) or after clinorotation [47].The level of membrane cholesterol is important for the structure and stability of dense microdomains. A significant increase in the cholesterol content is a marker of the increased rigidity of lipid rafts that reduces membrane permeability. The regulatory role of sterols in membrane structure and fluidity and the assembly of specific proteins will affect cell responses to abiotic stress and microgravity [22,54,77]. The concept of cholesterol clustering helps explain functions such as membrane fluidity via lipid ordering and membrane elasticity by protein interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton and the formation and stabilization of rafts themselves [43]. Interestingly, the equality of the CM fatty acid saturation index (the ratio between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids) for static and clinorotated samples was most likely based on new specific fatty acids that maintained CM fluidity (microviscosity) [31,78]. 3.1. Filipin Staining Fluorescent marker of sterols—filipin (a complex of four pentanes [79] from the actinomycete Streptomyces filipinensis)—is an antibiotic that is strongly fluorescent with a maximum emission at 482 nm (λex = 340 nm) upon binding to sterol-containing areas of cell membranes. Filipin fluorescence is the established tool for sterol visualization in biological membranes [50,80,81,82,83,84,85]. After filipin staining, the CM of root tip cells of 3-day-old pea seedlings acquired the characteristic blue color (Figure 3A) [86]. In 6-day-old seedlings, the CM was marked by filipin with a dashed thinner blue line (Figure 3C) and the intensity of the filipin fluorescence diminished, possibly because the cholesterol content decreased, as changes in the cholesterol labeling intensity depend on the developmental stage [87]. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Images of live, elongating root cells of 3-day-old (A,B) and 6-day-old (C,D) pea seedlings stained with filipin staining: (A,C)—control; (B,D)—clinorotated. Scale bar 20 μm [86].Under clinorotation, the filipin labeling of the CM in 3-day-old pea seedlings appeared interrupted, which may either indicate the uneven distribution of cholesterol (Figure 3B) or the uneven binding of the dye. After 6 days of clinorotation, the filipin-stained areas were significantly larger than in the controls, clusters formed, and fluorescence increased (Figure 3D). These data suggest an increase in the cholesterol content of membrane microdomains and the clustering of microdomains under clinorotation.3.2. Laurdan Staining Laurdan (or 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene), is a fluorescent, lipophilic probe and is widely used to study the structure of biological membranes [88] in addition to styryl dyes [89]. Its emission spectra depend on the parameters of the surrounding medium, such as polarity, hydration, and viscosity. Rafts form a liquid-ordered (Lo) phase on the membrane bilayer surface, which is surrounded by a liquid-disordered (Ld) phase [90,91]. Because the Lo phase is characterized by a higher level of lipid packing compared to the Ld phase, it is also less hydrated and more viscous [92,93]. The difference in the CM water content can be estimated [94,95]. The dynamics of the Lo and Ld phases of the CM under clinorotation were examined using laurdan as an imaging probe [86,96], developed for the observation of live plant cells. No significant differences were observed in the CM of the root tip cells of the control or the clinorotated seedlings in areas with different water contents. The expansion of the Lo areas (Figure 4) indicates higher rigidity, possibly the result of denser domains (rafts) under clinorotation. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Images of live 6-day-old pea root cells stained with laurdan without (A,C) and after clinorotation (B,D). Red fluorescence (620–650 nm) indicates higher water content, representing disordered (Ld) state. Blue-shifted emission (480–500 nm, green) indicates lower water content and ordered (Lo) state. Scale bar 50 μm [86].The significantly increased cholesterol content in lipid rafts and their increased density under clinorotation suggest changes in the associated proteins. Altered CM permeability is likely to affect cell metabolism as a response to mechanostimulation. These data suggest that clinorotation does not serve as a substitute for microgravity but that plants respond to enhanced mechanostimulation. This notion supports the observed effect of hypergravity on membrane lipid composition and the conclusion that gravity resistance depends on lipid rafts [97] as well as observations that clinorotation decreases but weightlessness increases amyloplast size [98].4. How Do Lipid Raft Studies Advance the Understanding of the Gravisensitivity of Plant Cells? Plant lipid rafts have been defined as the sterol-dependent ordered assemblies of specific lipids and proteins in the plant CM. The dependence of membrane function on their lipid composition and associated proteins can affect the activity of integral membrane proteins, including ion channels [99]. According to current concepts regarding the heterogeneity of the lipid bilayer, rafts link the CM with the cytoskeleton and affect cell polarization and thus signal transmission from the membrane surface to intracellular structures, in particular, the reorganization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Proteomic analysis revealed the inclusion of various actin-binding proteins as well as the actin and α- and β-chains of tubulin in rafts [51,100,101]. The influence of cholesterol on the actin cytoskeleton depends on the initial state of the microfilament network. Cholesterol-dependent rearrangements of the cytoskeleton are determined by the balance of globular and fibrillar actin in the cell, which demonstrates a new role of membrane cholesterol in cellular mechanotransduction and organization. The suggestion that the cytoskeleton may be a gravity sensor has been supported by its modifications in microgravity and clinorotation [102,103,104], especially in non-specialized cells [104]. For example, an increase in cortical actin microfilaments and the appearance of short and disoriented “scattered” microfilaments under clinorotation were described in the root and hypocotyl elongating cells of A. thaliana [104,105,106]. Possibly, clinorotation is assumed to enhance the mutual dependence between the actin and tubulin elements of the cytoskeleton and part of the cellular stress response [105,106]. Cortical microtubules, which regulate the movement of the cellulose-synthesizing complexes and control cellulose deposition in the cell wall [107,108,109] changed their orientation, were more randomly distributed and often shorter in A. thaliana hypocotyls in space flight and Beta vulgaris roots under clinorotation than in the controls [104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111]. Reduced tubulin gene transcription might have caused the suppression of MT reorientation. It is interesting to note that changes in the microtubule orientation and length occurred in the elongating cells of hypocotyls and the root distal elongation zone (DEZ), distinguishing specific physiological properties and functions [103,112,113,114]. Cytoskeletal elements regulate both the growth polarity and the maintenance of cellular growth [113,115]. Cell growth in the DEZ involves cytoplasm expansion (non-directional growth), which requires the dynamic formation of MT, which makes especially cortical MT more sensitive to changes related to microgravity. These microtubules function via associated proteins and regulatory kinases and phosphatases [116]. The sensitivity of the plant cell wall structure, composition, and function is well-established. [7,13,117]. The general phenomenon of cell wall thinning and softening in microgravity and clinorotation could be related to qualitative and quantitative changes in the poly- and monosaccharide composition based on the increased activity of cellulosopectolytic enzymes, for example, endo-1,4-B-glucanase, exo-1,4-B-glucanase, polygalacturonase, and pectin esterase. Such changes were demonstrated in the protonemata of Funaria hygrometrica grown under long-term slow clinorotation and in wheat plants grown in space [117]. Galacturonic acid reduced the methoxyl groups of pectins, which release calcium ions because of enhanced cellulose and pectin hydrolysis. Decreasing levels of cellulose and polysaccharides per unit of length have also been reported in the coleoptiles and roots of the Oryza sativa and A. thaliana hypocotyls in spaceflight compared with ground controls [13,118,119]. The degradation of 1,3:1,4-β-glucans reduces these polysaccharides in growing rice shoots and affects the mechanical properties of cell walls in microgravity. However, microgravity only slightly affected cell wall biopolymer synthesis and the deposition of cellulose microfibrils [120]. Modifications of the intracellular calcium concentration and localization were shown in microgravity and under clinorotation similar to the fluorescent calcium indicators chlorotetracycline and indo-1. Changes in the relative calcium ion content have been demonstrated in the cells of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris, the protonemata of Funaria hydrometrica, the statocytes of Pisum sativum, Melilotus album, and Glycine max, the microcalluses of Daucus carota and Brassica napus, as well as in the cytosol of the root hairs in Lepidium sativum and Beta vulgaris, and in the callus cell cultures of A. thaliana [121,122,123,124]. Most experiments showed that [calcium] in cells increased under microgravity and clinorotation. Calcium is a well-established second messenger and plays a crucial role in signal transduction in all eukaryotic cells. Its messenger functions involve transient changes in the cytosolic ion concentration in response to a variety of external and internal stimuli, including light, hormones, temperature, anoxia, salinity, and gravity [125,126,127]. The role of calcium ions as secondary messengers depends on short-term alterations in cytosolic concentration, which are mediated by the actions of Ca2+-permeable ion channels, the efflux by Ca2+-ATPases, and Ca2+/H+ exchangers [128,129,130]. Calcium ions enter the cytosol from the apoplast through selective channels in the CM and/or a release from intracellular sources, such as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the vacuole, which are typically activated by inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate [131]. An increase in the intracellular calcium activity in microgravity was assumed to occur due to the activation of mechanosensitive calcium channels, which was demonstrated by gadolinium, which blocks such channels [132,133], as well as a possible decrease in Ca2+-ATPase activity associated with lipid rafts [134]. The complex interactions between the roles of cholesterol and lipid microdomains in regulating mechanosensitive ion channels and the organization of the cytoskeleton provide multiple future research directions. These prospects for further studies of membrane lipid microdomains include their participation in cell signaling and cell membrane activities as part of experiments that seek to understand the effect of gravity and mechanostimulation on basic cellular processes in biological systems. There is an additional temporal element in this notion as the lipid profile of membranes changes depending on the type of tissue, cell, and organelle [45,67,135]. The quantitative differences in the content of lipids and fatty acids in the CM of epicotyls and roots are most likely associated with the structure, growth, and specific functions of specific cells [136]. In contrast to the root proper, the root cap contains statocytes, which are specialized cells for the perception of gravitational and mechanical stimuli including clinorotation. Therefore, the CM state of these tissues exhibits a specific composition [21,67]. The heterogeneity of lipid rafts is linked to the specificity of the transcriptome [137] and proteome interactions [138]. The successful implementation of Bioregenerative Life Support Systems, therefore, benefits from a better understanding of cell membrane functions, especially lipid rafts, and their improvement of nutrient acquisition [139].5. Conclusions The data and inferences described so far clearly indicate that the functional domains of membranes are critically important for signal integration and responses. We hope that this review will prompt future research on the effect of lipid rafts and membrane functions on general and gravitational physiology.Author Contributions Conceptualization, E.L.K.; writing—original draft preparation, E.L.K.; writing—review and editing, K.H.H.; microscopy, O.A.A.

    "abstract": "Abstract Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins.",

    "methods": "Methods Molecular Biology. To obtain pOO2-MSL10-GFP, the ORF of MSL10 was introduced into the pOO2-GFP vector (21) between the XmaI and BamHI cites. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce two stop codons between MSL10 and GFP sequences in pOO2-MSL10-GFP, creating pOO2-MSL10. Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro by SP6 polymerase using the mMessenger mMachine kit (Ambion) and stored at −80 °C until use. Oocyte Preparation. X. laevis oocytes (Dumont stage V or VI) were collected and handled as described (21). GFP signal was visible by confocal microscopy within 48 h of injection, but we observed increased channel activity after longer incubation times, oocytes were patched 1–3 wk after injection. Confocal Microscopy. Two to 10 days after injection with pOO2-MSL10-GFP cRNA, devitellinized oocytes (57) were placed on cavity slides and covered with thin coverslips. An Olympus Fluoview-1000 confocal with BX-61 microscope and FV10-ASW Olympus application software suite were used for image acquisition. Electrophysiology. The buffers used were as follows: complete ND96 (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes at pH 7.38; specific conductivity 13 mS/cm), TEA-Cl (98 mM TEA-Cl, 5 mM Hepes, 2 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.38 adjusted with TEA-OH), and 60 mM MgCl2 (with 2 mM Hepes). All traces were obtained from inside-out (excised) patches except for that shown in Fig. 3C, which came from an outside-out excised patch. Experiments in asymmetric buffers, symmetric high salt buffers, and gadolinium-containing buffer used Rainin Minipulse3 peristaltic pumps. In all measurements with asymmetric buffers, liquid junction potentials were corrected after the patch was broken. Electrode potential drift was tested before the experiments and was less than 0.1 mV per 10 min. The rest of materials and methods are as in ref. 21.",
    "results": "Results MSL10 Forms a ∼100-pS Mechanosensitive Channel in the Plasma Membrane of Xenopus Oocytes. We chose to characterize MSL10 in X. laevis oocytes, an established system for the expression and electrophysiological characterization of heterologous ion channels, including those from plants (19). The endogenous MS channels of Xenopus (20) were effectively inactivated upon excision of the membrane patch, as reported (21). Xenopus oocytes produced strong GFP signal at their periphery by 48 h after injection with MSL10-GFP cRNA, indicating that the MSL10 protein is efficiently translated and localized in or near the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab MSL10 expressed in X. laevis oocytes produces a channel activity upon membrane stretch. (A) Confocal image of a portion of an oocyte 5 d after injection with MSL10-GFP cRNA. (B) A representative trace illustrating the activation of MSL10 channels at both negative and positive membrane potentials in the same patch. Pipette bubble number (BN) 6, −70 mmHg. (C) Single-channel opening events induced by negative pipette pressure. Membrane potential −50 mV, pipette BN 4. (D) Single-channel opening events induced by positive pipette pressure. Membrane potential −40 mV, pipette BN 5. Symmetric ND96 buffer was used in B–D.Inside-out patches excised from oocytes injected with cRNA encoding either MSL10-GFP or untagged MSL10 reproducibly exhibited channel activity in response to membrane stretch in symmetric ND96 buffer (Fig. 1B), although we consistently observed higher activity when untagged MSL10 was used. MSL10 channel activity depended on an increase in membrane tension, but we observed that the same tension resulted in different current amplitudes at opposite membrane potentials in the same patch (representative traces are shown in Fig. 1B). Under negative membrane potentials, MSL10 single-channel events were easy to observe because of low noise and their stable behavior, whereas under positive membrane potentials, noise and flickery behavior were dominant. The ratio of peak current amplitude at negative to positive membrane potentials was 1.24 ± 0.15 (n = 7 oocytes). The results at negative membrane potentials are most likely to represent the behavior of the MSL10 in planta, because the transmembrane potential of Arabidopsis root cells has been measured at approximately −180 mV (for example, see ref. 22). MSL10 single-channel openings were readily detected in response to membrane stretch generated by both negative (Fig. 1C) and positive (Fig. 1D) pipette pressures. The current–voltage (I/V) curves for MSL10 and MSL10-GFP indicated that the single-channel conductances of both MSL10 and MSL10-GFP were 103 ± 3 pS in excised patches, measured as the slope of the I/V curve within the range of 0 to −60 mV (Fig. 2A). We did not use data from potentials lower than −60 mV in our calculation of conductance because of the presence of conducting substates (an example of which is shown in Fig. 2B). A conductance of 103 ± 3 pS is in good agreement with an MSL10-dependent activity present in Arabidopsis root protoplasts, which was measured at 137 pS under slightly different ionic conditions (5). Although the I/V curve for MSL10 was linear at positive and negative membrane potentials, the slopes were slightly different under the two conditions, with a single-channel conductance of 80 ± 2 pS at positive membrane potentials (0 to +60 mV), or 1.3-fold lower than at negative potentials. This slight current rectification may explain the 1.24-fold difference in current under positive and negative potentials described above and shown in Fig. 1B. Fig. 2.

MSL10 Exhibits a Moderate Preference for Anions. The reversal potential of MSL10 under asymmetric 100/300 mM salt was +19 mV (Fig. 3A), and the theoretical reversal potential of Cl− ion, derived from the Nernst equation under a threefold gradient of ion concentration, is +28 mV. The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation gives a ratio of Cl− to Na+ permeability (PCl:PNa) of 5.9 for MSL10. We also measured the conductance of MSL10 when Na+ was replaced with TEA+, a large ion with an estimated diameter of 8 Å (23) often used as a pore blocker of potassium channels (24, 25). Because Hille’s equation (26) also predicts an approximate pore diameter of 8 Å for MSL10 (assuming the pore to be a uniform cylinder 5 nm in length), TEA+ is not likely to permeate the MSL10 channel pore, nor does TEA+ serve to block MSL10 (Fig. 2A). The single-channel conductance of MSL10 in 100 mM symmetric TEA-Cl was ∼84% of that measured in symmetric ND96 (96 mM NaCl). This result is consistent with the PCl:PNa ratio of 5.9 for MSL10 calculated from Fig. 3A, which predicts that 83% of the MSL10 current in ND96 is provided by Cl−. The MSL10-dependent ion channel activity previously characterized in root protoplasts showed no change in conductance when CaCl2 in the bath solution was replaced with TEA-Cl, whereas current was abolished when Cl− was replaced with MES−—indicating that neither Ca2+ nor TEA+ can permeate the channel (5). MSL10 single-channel conductance showed saturation at relatively low ionic strength at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3B). In summary, MSL10 forms a channel with a moderate preference for anions, passing ∼6 chloride ions for every sodium ion. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Ion selectivity and Gd3+ inhibition of MSL10.

(D–F) Representative traces showing MSL10 channel activity in the same patch before and after perfusion with 100 μM GdCl3 (D), 50 μM GdCl3 (E), or 20 μM GdCl3 (F). In D, a trace from the same patch after washout is shown at right. Membrane potential −40 mV, BN 5, in symmetric ND96 supplemented with the indicated amounts of GdCl3 from the bath side. Pressure applied to the pipette was −60 mmHg in all cases except for the third trace in D, where the pressure was −90 mmHg. MSL10 Is Reversibly Inhibited by Gd3+ Ions in Inside-Out Patches. Gadolinium ions are commonly used to inhibit K+, Ca2+, and metazoan MS channels (27) and have also been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of MS channels in plants (28–30) and bacteria (31). Inhibition of MSL10 activity was observed after excised inside-out patches were perfused in a bath containing 100 μM GdCl3 (Fig. 3D). This inhibition was reversible, and MSL10 activity was recovered upon Gd3+ washout. Less effective inhibition was observed in patches perfused with 50 or 20 μM GdCl3 (Fig. 3 E and F), and an identical regime on outside-out patches did not significantly inhibit MSL10 activity (Fig. 3C). MSL10 Gating Kinetics and Inactivation. As shown in Fig. 1 B–D, all MSL10 traces—regardless of pipette size, transmembrane potential, or amount of applied pressure—exhibited a peak tension-induced current that was delayed compared with the peak of applied pressure. We used relatively fast ramp speeds (∼1 s) in our initial characterization of MSL10, in accordance with previous studies of MscS (e.g., ref. 32) and to reduce artifacts associated with changes in patch structure during recordings (33). Substantially slower ramp speeds (∼25 s) still produced the observed asymmetric pressure-dependence of channel opening and closing and did not depend on the number of activated channels (Fig. 4 A and B). Increasing the Mg2+ concentration of bath and pipette solutions, which has been shown to improve membrane-glass adhesion and facilitate gigaseal formation (34), did not alter the slow closing behavior of MSL10 (Fig. S2 A and B). Finally, we sequentially applied pressure ramps of different lengths (1 s, 5 s, and 25 s) to the same patch and compared the pressure at which the first channels opened or the last channels closed at each ramp speed (Fig. S3). The threshold pressure required to open MSL10 channels was reduced with slower ramp speeds, dropping 1.42 ± 0.17-fold between 1-s and 5-s ramps and 2.19 ± 0.34-fold between 1-s and 25-s ramps (n = 7 patches). In contrast, the ramp pressure at which all MSL10 channels had closed was always below the opening threshold pressure, regardless of the pressure ramp speed. In more than half of these experiments, the last MSL10 channel closed under zero applied pressure. We were not able to use the midpoint gating tension in our characterization of MSL10, because the oocyte membrane routinely ruptured before current saturation regardless of pressure ramp length, although this was not observed with MscS under the same conditions (Fig. S4 A and B).

Dashed lines in A indicate the first channel opening and last channel closing events. Both traces are 50 s long, membrane potential −20 mV, pipette BN 4.5, symmetric ND96 buffer. (C) Slow gating and absence of inactivation under sustained tension. The length of the whole trace is 45 s. Pipette BN 5, symmetric ND96 buffer, and membrane potential −40 mV.To gain further insight into MSL10 gating kinetics and adaptive behavior, we applied tension to the membrane in multiple sharp steps, as reported for MscS (35). Under these conditions, MSL10 displayed very slow opening and closing kinetics compared with MscS, even after multiple cycles (Fig. 4C). Occasionally a fraction of the channels stayed in the open state and did not close after pressure release at higher potentials (Fig. S2B). These data indicate that, under a variety of experimental conditions, the MSL10 channel closes at a much lower tension than is required for it to open, and in some conditions can remain open even in the absence of applied pressure. Unlike MscS, which enters a tension-unresponsive state after sustained stimulus (12, 32), we did not detect inactivation of MSL10 even after 10–20 s of sustained tension (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2B).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The presence of multiple diverse MS ion channel activities in the plasma and vacuolar membranes of land plants has been well documented over the past 20 y (summarized in ref. 3), and two candidate gene families have been identified in the model plant A. thaliana (reviewed in ref. 1). Here, we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to provide direct evidence that a member of one of these families, MSL10, provides a stretch-activated channel activity when heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes. MSL10 is likely to represent the activity described in the root protoplasts of a msl9-1;msl10-1 double mutant transiently expressing MSL10, an anion-preferring activity with a conductance of ∼137 pS at −182 mV (5). Although we were unable to measure MSL10 channel conductance in oocytes at such high potentials, this value is close to the conductance of oocyte-expressed MSL10 under our conditions (103 pS at 0 to −60 mV). In addition to the activity in roots that we can now assign to MSL10, a nonselective channel activity described in Arabidopsis, leaf mesophyll cells (36) also shows a preference for anions (PCl:PK ratio of 1.9), and may represent the activity of MSL10 or another MscS homolog. Our characterization of MSL10 channel behavior provides insight into the evolutionary conservation of structure and function between MscS homologs. Fig. S1 shows the known or predicted topology of MscS, MSL10, MSC1, and YbdG, a MscS homolog from E. coli to which we refer here as MscM (37, 38). MSL10 has an extended N terminus and a total of six TM helices, whereas MSC1 and MscM have five and MscS has three TM helices. The conserved “MscS domain” as defined here comprises the most C-terminal TM helix (TM3 in MscS) and the upper portion of the hollow cytoplasmic domain, called the β-domain (Fig. S1 A and B; ref. 39. Numerous studies on MscS have indicated the functional importance of the residues within the conserved region, primarily in the pore-lining TM3 helix (summarized in ref. 40). For example, the characteristic alteration between small and large hydrophobic residues appear to be responsible for proper TM3 packing in the MscS heptamer (41), and the hydrophobic seal residues L105 and L109 are essential for complete channel closure (39, 41–44). Although these structural motifs are for the most part preserved in MscM and MSC1, MSL10 shares very little homology in the predicted pore-lining region (Fig. S1C), instead exhibiting many bulky hydrophobic residues—including six phenylalanines—in the TM3 region. It is therefore surprising that MSL10 has MS channel activity at all, and perhaps even more surprising how closely MSL10 behavior resembles MscS, MscM, and/or MSC1. Unitary Conductance. MSL10 had a unitary conductance of 103 ± 3 pS in symmetric 100 mM NaCl, whereas MscS has a conductance of 330 pS under the same conditions (21) (approximately 1 nS when measured in 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM CaCl2; refs. 32, 41, and 45). Although MscM and MSC1 are highly similar to MscS with respect to the sequence of the pore-lining TM3 helix, they have conductances similar to that of MSL10: 100–150 pS in 100 mM KCl for MscM (37, 38) and 400 pS for MSC1 measured in 200 mM KCl with 40 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2 (17) (120–130 pS if measured in 100 mM salt). Although it is tempting to speculate that the many bulky hydrophobic residues in the pore-lining helix of MSL10 may be responsible for a smaller pore size—and therefore a smaller conductance than MscS—the smaller conductances of MscM and MSC1 require a different explanation. Ion Selectivity. Although formally nonselective, the MSL10 channel showed a preference for anions, with a PCl:PNa ratio of 5.9 based on reversal potential and on its conductance when Na+ was replaced with TEA+ (Figs. 2A and 3A). Other MscS family members display diverse ion selectivity: MscS demonstrates a weak preference for anions with PCl:PK = 1.2–3.0 (45–48), MscM a weak preference for cations, with PCl:PK = 0.4 (37), and MSC1 is as anion-selective as MSL10, with PCl:PK = 7 (17). MSL10 also showed saturation with increased solution conductivity at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3B). A conductance ratio of approximately 1.3 (negative membrane potential to positive membrane potential) was observed in these experiments, similar to that measured in symmetric ND96 (Fig. 2B). Although MscS does not show saturation up to 1.5 M KCl (46), a MscS homolog from the soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum saturated at negative, but not at positive, membrane voltages (49). Gadolinium is a potent inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels of various types (27, 30, 50, 51), but different mechanisms are likely to be involved in each case. Gd3+ ions inhibit Ca2+-selective stretch-activated channels at concentrations as low as 1 µM (30), but concentrations above 100 µM are required to inhibit the essentially nonselective bacterial channels MscS and MscL (31, 51). In the later case, gadolinium ions have been shown to inhibit MS channels through interactions with negatively charged lipids in the membrane (51). Efficient inhibition of MSL10 in inside-out patches was produced only at the highest concentration of gadolinium tested, 100 μM (Fig. 3 D–F). Even in this case, increased tension evoked partial restoration of channel activity. Because the inside but not the outside of the oocyte membranes contain the negatively charged lipids proposed to interact with Gd3+ (PS, PG, and PI) (51, 52), only Gd3+ treatment of inside-out patches would be expected to show lipid-mediated inhibition. Indeed, we did not observe consistent Gd3+ inhibition in outside-out patches (Fig. 3C), and conclude that, like MscL, MSL10 is likely to be inhibited by gadolinium ions indirectly through changes in lipid packing or increased membrane stiffness. Gating Dynamics. The hallmark of MSL10 activation is a dramatic asymmetry of current (hysteresis) with respect to the pressure ramp, suggesting that the membrane tension at which MSL10 opens is higher than the tension at which it subsequently closes. We reproducibly observed this behavior in experiments with pipettes of various diameters (BN 4–7), at opposite membrane potentials, under both positive and negative pipette pressures, with different ramp speeds, buffer compositions, and number of channels activated, making it unlikely to be an artifact (Figs. 1 and 4 and Figs. S2 and S3). The threshold tension for MSL10 opening depended on ramp speed (in the 1–25s range), decreasing on longer ramps; almost no effect on midpoint tension was seen with MscS opening (33), and no dependence on ramp speed was reported for MSC1 opening (17). Unlike MscS, the unusually slow closing kinetics of both MSL10 and MSC1 were not substantially affected by pressure ramp speed. These observations could be explained by different tension dependencies of opening and closing. The relaxation of the outer leaflet of the membrane in an excised patch described in ref. 53 has little effect on the tension at which MSL10 closes, because it stayed very close to zero in the majority of our experiments regardless of the ramp speed. A related feature of MSL10 activity is its behavior in response to application of sharp pressure steps (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2B). Under these conditions, residual MSL10 channel activity in the absence of applied pressure (corresponding to no or very weak membrane tension; ref. 54) was frequently observed after application of the threshold tension, although never before it. MscS demonstrates similar behavior upon closing when the G113A or G121A mutations are introduced (35), indicating that only a small change in identity at a key position (G113 forms a sharp kink in the TM3 of MscS; ref. 39) can produce this phenomenon. Only G121 is conserved in MSC1; neither G113 nor G121 is conserved in MSL10 (Fig. S1C). Bulky residues at these positions may make the pore-lining helix of MSL10 stiffer and allow the channel to maintain the open state for a longer period, even when little or no membrane tension is applied. In summary, MSL10 resembles MSC1 and MscM with respect to unitary channel conductance, MSC1 with respect to ion selectivity, and MSC1 and MscS G113A/MscS 121A with respect to gating kinetics. The similarities and differences between these four channels cannot be easily attributed to sequences previously identified as conserved among MscS family members or important for MscS channel function (summarized in ref. 40). Instead, these comparisons of sequence and electrophysiological characteristics show that there are still discoveries to be made regarding the relationship between structure and function in the MscS family of MS channels. Our characterization of MSL10 channel behavior also provides insight into its possible in planta function. Increased tension in the plasma membrane of a plant cell could result from hypoosmotic swelling, invasion of the cell by a pathogen, or bending of a plant organ. As demonstrated for MscS and MscM (12, 38), the immediate consequences of MSL10 opening could include the release of osmolytes, thereby preventing cell lysis under hypoosmotic shock or mechanical strain. However, its preference for anions leads us to speculate that MSL10 opening would also result in the depolarization of the cellular membrane via Cl− efflux. Once open, MSL10 would allow chloride ions to exit the plant cell until membrane tension was completely relieved. A negative feedback mechanism not present in oocyte membranes, such as interaction with signaling molecules, could promote MSL10 channel closing (as proposed for MSC1; ref. 17). In planta, MSL10 gating could lead to the activation of depolarization-activated Shaker-type potassium channels and depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, Ca2+ influx, and possibly the propagation of a systemic signal (55, 56). Thus, the electrophysiological characterization of a MscS homolog from a multicellular system opens up the exciting possibility that some members of this family of MS channels may not only release osmolytes from swelling cells and organelles, but also alter cell physiology and potentially participate in intercellular signaling.",

Issue date 2012 Nov 13.  Copyright notice ID: 3503204 PMID: 23112188 Abstract Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins. The perception of mechanical stimuli like gravity, touch, or osmotic pressure is essential to normal plant growth and development and is further implicated in biotic and abiotic stress responses (1). One of the best-studied strategies for perceiving force involves membrane-embedded channels that are gated by tension, known as mechanosensitive (MS) channels (2). Numerous MS channel activities (>17 to date) have been described in the membranes of diverse tissues from a variety of plant species (summarized in ref. 3, also refs. 4 and 5). Many of these observed MS channel activities differ in their conductance, ion selectivity, and/or sensitivity to the direction of activation pressure, suggesting that multiple classes of mechanosensitive channels are present in plant cells. No mechanosensitive ion channel activity discovered in plant membranes has yet been definitively identified at the molecular level, but two families of proteins serve as strong candidates. The first is the Mid1-Complementing Activity (MCA) family, members of which are required for root response to touch in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, induce Ca2+ uptake in rice and Arabidopsis cells (6, 7), and are associated with increased current in response to hypotonic stimulation of Xenopus oocytes (8). The second family of candidates for plant MS channels is the MscS-Like (MSL) family, first identified based on modest homology to the well-characterized bacterial MS channel MscS from Escherichia coli (3, 9). MscS is a largely nonselective stretch-activated channel that is gated directly by membrane tension, generating a 1-nanoSiemen (nS) conductance (reviewed in refs. 10 and 11). The primary function of MscS is to provide a conduit for the release of osmolytes from the bacterium in response to extreme hypoosmotic stress (12, 13). There are 10 MscS homologs in Arabidopsis, three with predicted or observed localization to organellar membranes and seven with predicted or observed localization to the plasma and vacuolar membranes (3, 5, 14). Reverse genetic analyses have demonstrated that two plastid-localized homologs, MSL2 and MSL3, are required for the proper size, shape, division, and hypoosmotic volume control of plastids (14–16). In addition, two plasma membrane-localized homologs, MSL9 and MSL10, are genetically required for the predominant MS channel activity in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis root cell protoplasts, providing support for the hypothesis that MSL proteins form MS channels (5). A MscS homolog from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, MSC1, has MS channel activity when expressed in giant E. coli spheroplasts (17). However, it has been proposed that the contribution of MSL9 and MSL10 to MS channel activity in root protoplasts may be indirect (1), and a more rigorous test by expression and electrophysiological characterization in a heterologous system is needed. Indeed, it seems likely that MSLs do not form MS channels, because the plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs from plants are highly divergent from MscS with respect to topology and show limited sequence similarity, even within the conserved domain (Fig. S1). Some bacterial MscS homologs do not appear to provide MS channel activities, further suggesting that a subset of the family has evolved to perform diverse functions (reviewed in ref. 18). We were thus motivated to develop a system for the electrophysiological investigation of MSL proteins to determine whether eukaryotic plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs indeed form MS channels and, if so, to compare their electrophysiological behavior with that of other MscS homologs. Here, we describe the heterologous expression and characterization of Arabidopsis MSL10 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Results MSL10 Forms a ∼100-pS Mechanosensitive Channel in the Plasma Membrane of Xenopus Oocytes. We chose to characterize MSL10 in X. laevis oocytes, an established system for the expression and electrophysiological characterization of heterologous ion channels, including those from plants (19). The endogenous MS channels of Xenopus (20) were effectively inactivated upon excision of the membrane patch, as reported (21). Xenopus oocytes produced strong GFP signal at their periphery by 48 h after injection with MSL10-GFP cRNA, indicating that the MSL10 protein is efficiently translated and localized in or near the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab MSL10 expressed in X. laevis oocytes produces a channel activity upon membrane stretch. (A) Confocal image of a portion of an oocyte 5 d after injection with MSL10-GFP cRNA. (B) A representative trace illustrating the activation of MSL10 channels at both negative and positive membrane potentials in the same patch. Pipette bubble number (BN) 6, −70 mmHg. (C) Single-channel opening events induced by negative pipette pressure. Membrane potential −50 mV, pipette BN 4. (D) Single-channel opening events induced by positive pipette pressure. Membrane potential −40 mV, pipette BN 5. Symmetric ND96 buffer was used in B–D.Inside-out patches excised from oocytes injected with cRNA encoding either MSL10-GFP or untagged MSL10 reproducibly exhibited channel activity in response to membrane stretch in symmetric ND96 buffer (Fig. 1B), although we consistently observed higher activity when untagged MSL10 was used. MSL10 channel activity depended on an increase in membrane tension, but we observed that the same tension resulted in different current amplitudes at opposite membrane potentials in the same patch (representative traces are shown in Fig. 1B). Under negative membrane potentials, MSL10 single-channel events were easy to observe because of low noise and their stable behavior, whereas under positive membrane potentials, noise and flickery behavior were dominant. The ratio of peak current amplitude at negative to positive membrane potentials was 1.24 ± 0.15 (n = 7 oocytes). The results at negative membrane potentials are most likely to represent the behavior of the MSL10 in planta, because the transmembrane potential of Arabidopsis root cells has been measured at approximately −180 mV (for example, see ref. 22). MSL10 single-channel openings were readily detected in response to membrane stretch generated by both negative (Fig. 1C) and positive (Fig. 1D) pipette pressures. The current–voltage (I/V) curves for MSL10 and MSL10-GFP indicated that the single-channel conductances of both MSL10 and MSL10-GFP were 103 ± 3 pS in excised patches, measured as the slope of the I/V curve within the range of 0 to −60 mV (Fig. 2A). We did not use data from potentials lower than −60 mV in our calculation of conductance because of the presence of conducting substates (an example of which is shown in Fig. 2B). A conductance of 103 ± 3 pS is in good agreement with an MSL10-dependent activity present in Arabidopsis root protoplasts, which was measured at 137 pS under slightly different ionic conditions (5). Although the I/V curve for MSL10 was linear at positive and negative membrane potentials, the slopes were slightly different under the two conditions, with a single-channel conductance of 80 ± 2 pS at positive membrane potentials (0 to +60 mV), or 1.3-fold lower than at negative potentials. This slight current rectification may explain the 1.24-fold difference in current under positive and negative potentials described above and shown in Fig. 1B. Fig. 2.

Pipette BN 5, symmetric ND96 buffer.MSL10 Exhibits a Moderate Preference for Anions. The reversal potential of MSL10 under asymmetric 100/300 mM salt was +19 mV (Fig. 3A), and the theoretical reversal potential of Cl− ion, derived from the Nernst equation under a threefold gradient of ion concentration, is +28 mV. The Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation gives a ratio of Cl− to Na+ permeability (PCl:PNa) of 5.9 for MSL10. We also measured the conductance of MSL10 when Na+ was replaced with TEA+, a large ion with an estimated diameter of 8 Å (23) often used as a pore blocker of potassium channels (24, 25). Because Hille’s equation (26) also predicts an approximate pore diameter of 8 Å for MSL10 (assuming the pore to be a uniform cylinder 5 nm in length), TEA+ is not likely to permeate the MSL10 channel pore, nor does TEA+ serve to block MSL10 (Fig. 2A). The single-channel conductance of MSL10 in 100 mM symmetric TEA-Cl was ∼84% of that measured in symmetric ND96 (96 mM NaCl). This result is consistent with the PCl:PNa ratio of 5.9 for MSL10 calculated from Fig. 3A, which predicts that 83% of the MSL10 current in ND96 is provided by Cl−. The MSL10-dependent ion channel activity previously characterized in root protoplasts showed no change in conductance when CaCl2 in the bath solution was replaced with TEA-Cl, whereas current was abolished when Cl− was replaced with MES−—indicating that neither Ca2+ nor TEA+ can permeate the channel (5). MSL10 single-channel conductance showed saturation at relatively low ionic strength at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3B). In summary, MSL10 forms a channel with a moderate preference for anions, passing ∼6 chloride ions for every sodium ion. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Ion selectivity and Gd3+ inhibition of MSL10.

(D–F) Representative traces showing MSL10 channel activity in the same patch before and after perfusion with 100 μM GdCl3 (D), 50 μM GdCl3 (E), or 20 μM GdCl3 (F). In D, a trace from the same patch after washout is shown at right. Membrane potential −40 mV, BN 5, in symmetric ND96 supplemented with the indicated amounts of GdCl3 from the bath side. Pressure applied to the pipette was −60 mmHg in all cases except for the third trace in D, where the pressure was −90 mmHg.MSL10 Is Reversibly Inhibited by Gd3+ Ions in Inside-Out Patches. Gadolinium ions are commonly used to inhibit K+, Ca2+, and metazoan MS channels (27) and have also been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of MS channels in plants (28–30) and bacteria (31). Inhibition of MSL10 activity was observed after excised inside-out patches were perfused in a bath containing 100 μM GdCl3 (Fig. 3D). This inhibition was reversible, and MSL10 activity was recovered upon Gd3+ washout. Less effective inhibition was observed in patches perfused with 50 or 20 μM GdCl3 (Fig. 3 E and F), and an identical regime on outside-out patches did not significantly inhibit MSL10 activity (Fig. 3C).MSL10 Gating Kinetics and Inactivation. As shown in Fig. 1 B–D, all MSL10 traces—regardless of pipette size, transmembrane potential, or amount of applied pressure—exhibited a peak tension-induced current that was delayed compared with the peak of applied pressure. We used relatively fast ramp speeds (∼1 s) in our initial characterization of MSL10, in accordance with previous studies of MscS (e.g., ref. 32) and to reduce artifacts associated with changes in patch structure during recordings (33). Substantially slower ramp speeds (∼25 s) still produced the observed asymmetric pressure-dependence of channel opening and closing and did not depend on the number of activated channels (Fig. 4 A and B). Increasing the Mg2+ concentration of bath and pipette solutions, which has been shown to improve membrane-glass adhesion and facilitate gigaseal formation (34), did not alter the slow closing behavior of MSL10 (Fig. S2 A and B). Finally, we sequentially applied pressure ramps of different lengths (1 s, 5 s, and 25 s) to the same patch and compared the pressure at which the first channels opened or the last channels closed at each ramp speed (Fig. S3). The threshold pressure required to open MSL10 channels was reduced with slower ramp speeds, dropping 1.42 ± 0.17-fold between 1-s and 5-s ramps and 2.19 ± 0.34-fold between 1-s and 25-s ramps (n = 7 patches). In contrast, the ramp pressure at which all MSL10 channels had closed was always below the opening threshold pressure, regardless of the pressure ramp speed. In more than half of these experiments, the last MSL10 channel closed under zero applied pressure. We were not able to use the midpoint gating tension in our characterization of MSL10, because the oocyte membrane routinely ruptured before current saturation regardless of pressure ramp length, although this was not observed with MscS under the same conditions (Fig. S4 A and B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Gating kinetics and inactivation of MSL10. (A and B) Asymmetric opening and closing kinetics under slow ramp speeds in patches with many (A) and few (B) channels. Dashed lines in A indicate the first channel opening and last channel closing events. Both traces are 50 s long, membrane potential −20 mV, pipette BN 4.5, symmetric ND96 buffer. (C) Slow gating and absence of inactivation under sustained tension. The length of the whole trace is 45 s. Pipette BN 5, symmetric ND96 buffer, and membrane potential −40 mV.To gain further insight into MSL10 gating kinetics and adaptive behavior, we applied tension to the membrane in multiple sharp steps, as reported for MscS (35). Under these conditions, MSL10 displayed very slow opening and closing kinetics compared with MscS, even after multiple cycles (Fig. 4C). Occasionally a fraction of the channels stayed in the open state and did not close after pressure release at higher potentials (Fig. S2B). These data indicate that, under a variety of experimental conditions, the MSL10 channel closes at a much lower tension than is required for it to open, and in some conditions can remain open even in the absence of applied pressure. Unlike MscS, which enters a tension-unresponsive state after sustained stimulus (12, 32), we did not detect inactivation of MSL10 even after 10–20 s of sustained tension (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2B).Discussion The presence of multiple diverse MS ion channel activities in the plasma and vacuolar membranes of land plants has been well documented over the past 20 y (summarized in ref. 3), and two candidate gene families have been identified in the model plant A. thaliana (reviewed in ref. 1). Here, we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to provide direct evidence that a member of one of these families, MSL10, provides a stretch-activated channel activity when heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes. MSL10 is likely to represent the activity described in the root protoplasts of a msl9-1;msl10-1 double mutant transiently expressing MSL10, an anion-preferring activity with a conductance of ∼137 pS at −182 mV (5). Although we were unable to measure MSL10 channel conductance in oocytes at such high potentials, this value is close to the conductance of oocyte-expressed MSL10 under our conditions (103 pS at 0 to −60 mV). In addition to the activity in roots that we can now assign to MSL10, a nonselective channel activity described in Arabidopsis, leaf mesophyll cells (36) also shows a preference for anions (PCl:PK ratio of 1.9), and may represent the activity of MSL10 or another MscS homolog. Our characterization of MSL10 channel behavior provides insight into the evolutionary conservation of structure and function between MscS homologs. Fig. S1 shows the known or predicted topology of MscS, MSL10, MSC1, and YbdG, a MscS homolog from E. coli to which we refer here as MscM (37, 38). MSL10 has an extended N terminus and a total of six TM helices, whereas MSC1 and MscM have five and MscS has three TM helices. The conserved “MscS domain” as defined here comprises the most C-terminal TM helix (TM3 in MscS) and the upper portion of the hollow cytoplasmic domain, called the β-domain (Fig. S1 A and B; ref. 39. Numerous studies on MscS have indicated the functional importance of the residues within the conserved region, primarily in the pore-lining TM3 helix (summarized in ref. 40). For example, the characteristic alteration between small and large hydrophobic residues appear to be responsible for proper TM3 packing in the MscS heptamer (41), and the hydrophobic seal residues L105 and L109 are essential for complete channel closure (39, 41–44). Although these structural motifs are for the most part preserved in MscM and MSC1, MSL10 shares very little homology in the predicted pore-lining region (Fig. S1C), instead exhibiting many bulky hydrophobic residues—including six phenylalanines—in the TM3 region. It is therefore surprising that MSL10 has MS channel activity at all, and perhaps even more surprising how closely MSL10 behavior resembles MscS, MscM, and/or MSC1. Unitary Conductance. MSL10 had a unitary conductance of 103 ± 3 pS in symmetric 100 mM NaCl, whereas MscS has a conductance of 330 pS under the same conditions (21) (approximately 1 nS when measured in 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM CaCl2; refs. 32, 41, and 45). Although MscM and MSC1 are highly similar to MscS with respect to the sequence of the pore-lining TM3 helix, they have conductances similar to that of MSL10: 100–150 pS in 100 mM KCl for MscM (37, 38) and 400 pS for MSC1 measured in 200 mM KCl with 40 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2 (17) (120–130 pS if measured in 100 mM salt). Although it is tempting to speculate that the many bulky hydrophobic residues in the pore-lining helix of MSL10 may be responsible for a smaller pore size—and therefore a smaller conductance than MscS—the smaller conductances of MscM and MSC1 require a different explanation.Ion Selectivity. Although formally nonselective, the MSL10 channel showed a preference for anions, with a PCl:PNa ratio of 5.9 based on reversal potential and on its conductance when Na+ was replaced with TEA+ (Figs. 2A and 3A). Other MscS family members display diverse ion selectivity: MscS demonstrates a weak preference for anions with PCl:PK = 1.2–3.0 (45–48), MscM a weak preference for cations, with PCl:PK = 0.4 (37), and MSC1 is as anion-selective as MSL10, with PCl:PK = 7 (17). MSL10 also showed saturation with increased solution conductivity at both positive and negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3B). A conductance ratio of approximately 1.3 (negative membrane potential to positive membrane potential) was observed in these experiments, similar to that measured in symmetric ND96 (Fig. 2B). Although MscS does not show saturation up to 1.5 M KCl (46), a MscS homolog from the soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum saturated at negative, but not at positive, membrane voltages (49). Gadolinium is a potent inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels of various types (27, 30, 50, 51), but different mechanisms are likely to be involved in each case. Gd3+ ions inhibit Ca2+-selective stretch-activated channels at concentrations as low as 1 µM (30), but concentrations above 100 µM are required to inhibit the essentially nonselective bacterial channels MscS and MscL (31, 51). In the later case, gadolinium ions have been shown to inhibit MS channels through interactions with negatively charged lipids in the membrane (51). Efficient inhibition of MSL10 in inside-out patches was produced only at the highest concentration of gadolinium tested, 100 μM (Fig. 3 D–F). Even in this case, increased tension evoked partial restoration of channel activity. Because the inside but not the outside of the oocyte membranes contain the negatively charged lipids proposed to interact with Gd3+ (PS, PG, and PI) (51, 52), only Gd3+ treatment of inside-out patches would be expected to show lipid-mediated inhibition. Indeed, we did not observe consistent Gd3+ inhibition in outside-out patches (Fig. 3C), and conclude that, like MscL, MSL10 is likely to be inhibited by gadolinium ions indirectly through changes in lipid packing or increased membrane stiffness.Gating Dynamics. The hallmark of MSL10 activation is a dramatic asymmetry of current (hysteresis) with respect to the pressure ramp, suggesting that the membrane tension at which MSL10 opens is higher than the tension at which it subsequently closes. We reproducibly observed this behavior in experiments with pipettes of various diameters (BN 4–7), at opposite membrane potentials, under both positive and negative pipette pressures, with different ramp speeds, buffer compositions, and number of channels activated, making it unlikely to be an artifact (Figs. 1 and 4 and Figs. S2 and S3). The threshold tension for MSL10 opening depended on ramp speed (in the 1–25s range), decreasing on longer ramps; almost no effect on midpoint tension was seen with MscS opening (33), and no dependence on ramp speed was reported for MSC1 opening (17). Unlike MscS, the unusually slow closing kinetics of both MSL10 and MSC1 were not substantially affected by pressure ramp speed. These observations could be explained by different tension dependencies of opening and closing. The relaxation of the outer leaflet of the membrane in an excised patch described in ref. 53 has little effect on the tension at which MSL10 closes, because it stayed very close to zero in the majority of our experiments regardless of the ramp speed. A related feature of MSL10 activity is its behavior in response to application of sharp pressure steps (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2B). Under these conditions, residual MSL10 channel activity in the absence of applied pressure (corresponding to no or very weak membrane tension; ref. 54) was frequently observed after application of the threshold tension, although never before it. MscS demonstrates similar behavior upon closing when the G113A or G121A mutations are introduced (35), indicating that only a small change in identity at a key position (G113 forms a sharp kink in the TM3 of MscS; ref. 39) can produce this phenomenon. Only G121 is conserved in MSC1; neither G113 nor G121 is conserved in MSL10 (Fig. S1C). Bulky residues at these positions may make the pore-lining helix of MSL10 stiffer and allow the channel to maintain the open state for a longer period, even when little or no membrane tension is applied. In summary, MSL10 resembles MSC1 and MscM with respect to unitary channel conductance, MSC1 with respect to ion selectivity, and MSC1 and MscS G113A/MscS 121A with respect to gating kinetics. The similarities and differences between these four channels cannot be easily attributed to sequences previously identified as conserved among MscS family members or important for MscS channel function (summarized in ref. 40). Instead, these comparisons of sequence and electrophysiological characteristics show that there are still discoveries to be made regarding the relationship between structure and function in the MscS family of MS channels. Our characterization of MSL10 channel behavior also provides insight into its possible in planta function. Increased tension in the plasma membrane of a plant cell could result from hypoosmotic swelling, invasion of the cell by a pathogen, or bending of a plant organ. As demonstrated for MscS and MscM (12, 38), the immediate consequences of MSL10 opening could include the release of osmolytes, thereby preventing cell lysis under hypoosmotic shock or mechanical strain. However, its preference for anions leads us to speculate that MSL10 opening would also result in the depolarization of the cellular membrane via Cl− efflux. Once open, MSL10 would allow chloride ions to exit the plant cell until membrane tension was completely relieved. A negative feedback mechanism not present in oocyte membranes, such as interaction with signaling molecules, could promote MSL10 channel closing (as proposed for MSC1; ref. 17). In planta, MSL10 gating could lead to the activation of depolarization-activated Shaker-type potassium channels and depolarization-activated Ca2+ channels, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, Ca2+ influx, and possibly the propagation of a systemic signal (55, 56). Thus, the electrophysiological characterization of a MscS homolog from a multicellular system opens up the exciting possibility that some members of this family of MS channels may not only release osmolytes from swelling cells and organelles, but also alter cell physiology and potentially participate in intercellular signaling.Methods Molecular Biology. To obtain pOO2-MSL10-GFP, the ORF of MSL10 was introduced into the pOO2-GFP vector (21) between the XmaI and BamHI cites. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce two stop codons between MSL10 and GFP sequences in pOO2-MSL10-GFP, creating pOO2-MSL10. Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro by SP6 polymerase using the mMessenger mMachine kit (Ambion) and stored at −80 °C until use.Oocyte Preparation. X. laevis oocytes (Dumont stage V or VI) were collected and handled as described (21). GFP signal was visible by confocal microscopy within 48 h of injection, but we observed increased channel activity after longer incubation times, oocytes were patched 1–3 wk after injection.Confocal Microscopy. Two to 10 days after injection with pOO2-MSL10-GFP cRNA, devitellinized oocytes (57) were placed on cavity slides and covered with thin coverslips. An Olympus Fluoview-1000 confocal with BX-61 microscope and FV10-ASW Olympus application software suite were used for image acquisition.Electrophysiology. The buffers used were as follows: complete ND96 (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes at pH 7.38; specific conductivity 13 mS/cm), TEA-Cl (98 mM TEA-Cl, 5 mM Hepes, 2 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.38 adjusted with TEA-OH), and 60 mM MgCl2 (with 2 mM Hepes). All traces were obtained from inside-out (excised) patches except for that shown in Fig. 3C, which came from an outside-out excised patch. Experiments in asymmetric buffers, symmetric high salt buffers, and gadolinium-containing buffer used Rainin Minipulse3 peristaltic pumps. In all measurements with asymmetric buffers, liquid junction potentials were corrected after the patch was broken. Electrode potential drift was tested before the experiments and was less than 0.1 mV per 10 min. The rest of materials and methods are as in ref. 21.Supplementary Material Supporting Information supp_109_46_19015__index.html (1KB, html) Acknowledgments This project was supported in part by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds through National Institutes of Health Grant R01GM084211-01 (to Doug Rees, Rob Phillips, and E.S.H.).Footnotes The authors declare no conflict of interest.

    "abstract": "Abstract Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.

    "introduction": "Introduction Pain is a complex sensation. It serves to protect organisms from harmful stimuli, but can also become chronic and debilitating following tissue injury and disease. Distinct cells and molecules detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Thermal pain is detected by thermosensitive TRP channels in subsets of nociceptors (Caterina et al., 2000; Vriens et al., 2011), and gentle touch is detected by Piezo2 channels in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) (Ranade et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2014). Aδ high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) have been shown to play a key role in responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017). Recent studies have shown that there are at least two populations of HTMRs that mediate responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. The Npy2r+ subpopulation of HTMRs mediates fast paw withdrawal responses to pinprick stimulation and terminates as free nerve endings in the epidermis (Arcourt et al., 2017). The Calca+ subpopulation of circumferential-HTMRs responds to noxious force and hair pulling, and terminates as circumferential endings wrapped around guard hair follicles (Ghitani et al., 2017). Additionally, somatostatin-expressing interneurons of laminae I-III in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receive input from nociceptors and are required for behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Duan et al., 2014). Despite these advances in defining the cells and circuits of mechanical pain, little is known about the molecular signaling pathways in mechanonociceptors. Here, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is required for mechanical pain sensation. S1P is a bioactive lipid that signals via 5 G-protein coupled S1P Receptors (S1PRs 1–5). S1P signaling, mainly via S1PR1, plays a well-known role in immune cell migration and maturation (Spiegel and Milstien, 2003; Matloubian et al., 2004; Schwab et al., 2005). Additionally, recent studies have shown that S1PRs are expressed throughout the nervous system (Janes et al., 2014; Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and S1P signaling is associated with a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., 2010) and Alzheimer’s disease (Couttas et al., 2014). S1P has been implicated in spontaneous pain (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and thermal pain hypersensitivity (Mair et al., 2011; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015), but due to conflicting accounts of S1P receptor expression in the CNS (Janes et al., 2014; Weth-Malsch et al., 2016) and PNS (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Usoskin et al., 2015) as well as inconsistent reports on the effects of S1P on neuronal excitability (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015) and pain behaviors (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015), the role of S1P in somatosensation remains controversial. We found that mice lacking the S1P receptor S1PR3 display striking and selective deficits in behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Likewise, peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signaling or S1P production impairs mechanical sensitivity. We show that S1P constitutively enhances the excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via closure of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels to tune mechanical pain sensitivity. The effects of S1P are completely dependent on S1PR3. While previous studies have shown that elevated S1P triggers acute pain and injury-evoked thermal sensitization (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), we now demonstrate that baseline levels of S1P are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, elevated S1P selectively triggers thermal sensitization via activation of TRPV1+ heat nociceptors, with no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings uncover an essential role for constitutive S1P signaling in mechanical pain.",

    "results": "Results To identify candidate genes underlying mechanosensation, we previously performed transcriptome analysis of the sensory ganglia innervating the ultra-sensitive tactile organ (the star) of the star-nosed mole (Gerhold et al., 2013). Immunostaining revealed the tactile organ is preferentially innervated by myelinated Aδ fibers (Gerhold et al., 2013), which are primarily mechanosensitive. While our original analysis focused on ion channels enriched in the neurons of the star organ, our dataset also revealed enrichment of several components of the S1P pathway, including S1pr3. Likewise, single-cell RNA seq of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed S1pr3 expression in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015) in addition to a subpopulation of peptidergic C nociceptors. S1P promotes excitability in small-diameter, capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). In addition, S1PR3 has been shown to mediate spontaneous pain triggered by elevated S1P and thermal sensitization following sterile tissue injury (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013). However, no studies have examined the role of S1PR3 in mechanosensation or in regulating somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions. Given the enrichment of S1pr3 in mechanosensory neurons of the star-nosed mole and mouse, we hypothesized that S1P signaling via S1PR3 may also play a role in mechanosensation. Thus, we set out to define the role of S1P signaling and S1PR3 in somatosensory mechanoreceptors. S1PR3 mediates acute mechanical pain We first examined a variety of somatosensory behaviors in mice lacking S1PR3 (Kono et al., 2004) (S1pr3tm1Rlp/Mmnc; referred to herein as S1PR3 KO). We initially investigated baseline responses to mechanical stimuli. S1PR3 KO mice displayed a dramatic loss of mechanical sensitivity (Figure 1A; see Figure 1—source data 1), as von Frey paw withdrawal thresholds were significantly elevated in S1PR3 KO mice relative to WT and S1PR3 HET littermates (mean thresholds: 1.737 g vs. 0.736 and 0.610 g, respectively). Moreover, S1PR3 KO mice demonstrated decreased responses to a range of noxious tactile stimuli (2–6 g; Figure 1B) and to noxious pinprick stimulation (Figure 1C), but normal responsiveness to innocuous tactile stimuli (0.6–1.4 g; Figure 1B). S1PR3 KO mice exhibited normal tape removal attempts (Ranade et al., 2014) (Figure 1D), righting reflexes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), radiant heat withdrawal latencies (Figure 1E), and itch-evoked scratching (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). These results demonstrate a selective role for S1PR3 in acute mechanical pain. Figure 1. S1PR3 mediates acute mechanical pain.

Unless otherwise indicated, error bars represent mean ± SD. Open in a new tabAs a complement to our analysis of somatosensation in S1PR3 KO animals, we employed a pharmacological approach, using the S1PR3-selective antagonist TY 52156 (TY) (Nussbaum et al., 2015). Similar to the phenotype of knockout animals, intradermal injection of 500 µM TY into the mouse hindpaw (the site of testing) triggered a rapid and significant elevation in von Frey paw withdrawal thresholds (Figure 1F) and decreased responsiveness to noxious (2–6 g), but not innocuous (0.6–1.4 g), tactile stimuli (Figure 1G), without affecting noxious heat sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). By contrast, blockade of S1PR1 with the selective antagonist W146 (Finley et al., 2013) had no effect on baseline mechanical or thermal thresholds (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Overall, these data show that S1PR3 signaling sets mechanical pain sensitivity. Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain We next asked whether peripheral S1P was required for the S1PR3-dependent effects on mechanosensation. We decreased S1P levels via injection of the sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI II to block local production of S1P (Chiba et al., 2010) or elevated S1P levels via intradermal injection of S1P and measured behaviors 30 min after injection. Decreasing local S1P levels with SKI II significantly reduced mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A; see Figure 2—source data 1), comparable to the hyposensitivity phenotype observed in S1PR3 KO mice (Figure 1A). Again, similar to what was observed in S1PR3 KO animals (Figure 1E), peripheral blockade of S1P production had no effect on baseline thermal sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Surprisingly, injecting exogenous S1P (10 µM; maximum solubility in saline vehicle) had no effect on mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A–B). However, as previously reported (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), S1P injection triggered S1PR3-dependent thermal hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain (Figure 2C–D), demonstrating that the lack of effect on mechanical hypersensitivity is not due to problems with S1P delivery or degradation.

Tukey Kramer comparisons are indicated on graph. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Figure 2—source data 1. Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain.Related to Figure 2. elife-33285-fig2-data1.xlsx (49KB, xlsx) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.33285.006 These data support a model whereby S1P constitutively activates S1PR3 to set normal mechanical pain thresholds. To further test this model, we asked if the mechanical hyposensitivity elicited after endogenous S1P depletion (via SKI II) could be rescued by local injection of exogenous S1P. Indeed, we found that injection of exogenous S1P reversed SKI II-induced mechanical hyposensitivity in a dose-dependent manner, and observed a maximal effect with 200 nM S1P (Figure 2E). Although quantification of native S1P levels in skin is inaccurate owing to avid lyase activity (Shaner et al., 2009), our data establish that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain, such that increased S1P does not evoke mechanical hypersensitivity, but diminished S1P leads to mechanical hyposensitivity. These data show that constitutive activation of S1PR3 by S1P is required for normal mechanosensitivity. S1PR3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors Our behavioral data showing distinct roles for S1PR3 in mechanonociception and thermal hypersensitivity suggest that S1PR3 is expressed in distinct subsets of somatosensory neurons. While a previous study suggested that all somatosensory neurons express S1PR3 (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), single cell RNA seq data suggests S1pr3 is not expressed by all DRG neurons (Usoskin et al., 2015), and no studies have performed quantitative analysis of S1PR3 staining or co-staining to define subpopulations of S1PR3+ neurons. We thus set out to characterize the somatosensory neuron subtypes expressing S1pr3 using in situ hybridization (ISH) of wild-type somatosensory ganglia and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse (Sanna et al., 2016). We first used in situ hybridization (ISH) with a specific S1pr3 probe to examine expression patterns of S1pr3 (Figure 3A–B; see Supplementary file 1). In our experiments, 43% of cells from wild-type DRG expressed S1pr3. Co-ISH revealed that one population of S1pr3+ neurons represents Aδ mechanonociceptors (AMs). These cells expressed Scn1a (39.9% of all S1pr3+), a gene that encodes the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which mediates mechanical pain in Aδ fibers (Osteen et al., 2016). S1pr3+ cells also co-expressed Npy2r (20.4% of all S1pr3+), a marker of a subset of mechanonociceptive A fibers (Arcourt et al., 2017). S1pr3 was expressed in 70.6% of Scn1a+ cells and 72% of Npy2r+ cells, comprising a majority of both of these populations. Interestingly, a subset of cells co-expressed S1pr3 and the mechanically sensitive channel Piezo2, which is expressed by Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers (Ranade et al., 2014). The remaining S1pr3+ cells were Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ C nociceptors (67.1% of all S1pr3+), which are reported to overlap minimally with the Scn1a+ and Npy2r+ populations (Arcourt et al., 2017; Osteen et al., 2016). Figure 3. S1pr3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and C thermal nociceptors.

Open in a new tabWe next used an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse, which produces a functional S1PR3-mCherry fusion protein (Sanna et al., 2016), as an independent strategy to explore S1PR3 expression and localization. This strategy was used because we found that anti-S1PR3 antibodies showed broad immunoreactivity in DRG from mice lacking S1PR3, and so we instead used anti-DsRed antibodies to probe expression of the S1PR3 fusion protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We found that 42.4% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-Peripherin, demonstrating that S1PR3 is expressed in a subset of small-diameter neurons. We also observed that 69.5% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-NF200, which marks medium and large-diameter myelinated neurons. Furthermore, we observed that S1PR3+ cells were primarily of small to medium diameter (11.3–35.1 µm), whereas all cells in the DRG ranged from 11.3 to 53.9 µm. Overall, these data support the expression of S1PR3 in subsets of small-diameter thermal nociceptors and medium-diameter mechanonociceptors (Figure 3F). Additionally, no significant differences were observed between WT and S1PR3 KO DRG in number of Trpa1+, Trpv1+, Peripherin+, NF200+, or IB4+ cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C,F,G). The mean diameters of Trpv1+ neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, left), NF200+ neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G), or all neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, right) in WT versus KO DRG were not significantly different, suggesting no loss of major sensory neuronal subtypes in the S1PR3 KO. We then visualized S1PR3 expression in nerve fibers that innervate the skin using anti-DsRed antibodies in whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC; Figure 3D). The reporter animals showed no specific antibody staining in epidermal or dermal cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I), and single-cell RNA seq of a diverse array of mouse epidermal and dermal cells corroborates this lack of expression (Joost et al., 2016). We observed overlap of S1PR3-expressing free nerve endings with NF200+ myelinated free nerves and NF200- putative C-fiber endings (Figure 3F), but did not observe expression of S1PR3 in NF200+ circumferential or lanceolate hair follicle receptors, or in putative Merkel afferents (Figure 3D–E). β-tubulin III, PGP9.5 (pan-neuronal markers), and NF200 staining in S1PR3 KO skin displayed patterns of epidermal and dermal innervation similar to WT skin, suggesting the phenotypes observed in the S1PR3 KO mice are not due to developmental loss of sensory neuronal innervation (pPGP9.5= 0.443 (n = 93, 38 fibers); pNefH = 0.405 (n = 61, 28 fibers); pBTIII = 0.353 (n = 104, 89 fibers); two-tailed t-tests based on average number of fibers per field of view). These results support expression of S1PR3 in subsets of myelinated A mechanonociceptors and unmyelinated C nociceptors that terminate as free nerve endings. S1P activates thermal nociceptors but not putative AMs Live imaging of cultured DRG neurons from adult reporter animals showed expression of S1PR3-mCherry fusion protein in 48.3% of neurons, mirroring our ISH and IHC results (Figure 4A). To examine the effects of S1P on A mechanonociceptors and C nociceptors, we performed ratiometric calcium imaging and electrophysiology on DRG cultures from reporter mice. Interestingly, only 56.1 ± 22.4% of mCherry-expressing neurons were activated by 1 µM S1P (Representative trace in Figure 4B; representative images in Figure 4C), which our dose-response showed to be the saturating concentration for calcium influx (Figure 4D; EC50 = 155 nM). All S1P-responsive neurons were also capsaicin-sensitive (n > 2000 neurons). And while sensory neurons from S1PR3 KO animals did not respond to S1P, as expected (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), they exhibited capsaicin responses that were not significantly different from WT neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). The mean diameter of S1P-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 22.4 ± 1.0 µm, whereas the mean diameter of non-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 28.7 ± 3.2 µm (p=0.0002, two-tailed t-test). We also performed whole cell current clamp experiments and, consistent with other studies (Mair et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015), found that S1P evoked action potential firing in capsaicin-sensitive small diameter cells (Figure 4E). This shows that only the small-diameter, S1PR3+ putative nociceptors are excited by S1P. We next asked whether the S1PR3+ medium-large diameter neurons represent the mechanonociceptors observed by ISH (Figure 3A). To this end, we asked whether the spider toxin Hm1a, a selective activator of AM nociceptors (Osteen et al., 2016), triggers calcium influx in S1PR3-expressing trigeminal neurons. Indeed, we found that 44.2 ± 15.1% of Hm1a-responsive neurons expressed mCherry (Figure 4F), consistent with our staining showing expression of S1pr3 in AM nociceptors and the role of Hm1a-responsive neurons in mediating mechanical pain in vivo (Osteen et al., 2016). Figure 4. S1P activates thermal nociceptors but not mechanonociceptors.

S1PR3 modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate AM excitability We next interrogated the molecular mechanism by which S1P signaling in AM nociceptors may regulate mechanical pain. We performed whole-cell current clamp on the medium-diameter S1pr3mCherry/+ dissociated DRG neurons (membrane capacitance = 61.05 ± 1.92 pF), which did not display S1P-evoked calcium influx (Figure 4B–C). In these cells, 1 µM S1P application did not change membrane potential (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 5—source data 1) or elicit firing in the absence of current injection (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Figure 5A). However, S1P dramatically lowered the threshold to fire action potentials (rheobase) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Figure 5. S1PR3 modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate AM excitability. All experiments were performed in S1pr3mCherry/+ or -/- DRG neurons.

The current-voltage relationship was determined by subtraction of the post-S1P current from the pre-S1P current and reverses at −60.125 mV; n = 6 cells. Data were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. Pre- and post-S1P currents were measured at the indicated voltage (−100 mV to +80 mV, 20 mV increments) following a +100 mV step (100 ms).

Tukey Kramer post hoc p-values indicated on graph. (G) Dose-response relationship between % ∆ in tail current and S1P concentration for 1 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 1 µM S1P (n = 7 cells). EC50 (48.8 nM), marked by thin dotted lines, was estimated from sigmoidal fit (thick dotted line). Open in a new tabWe then set out to determine the mechanism by which S1PR3 activity increases neuronal excitability using whole-cell voltage clamp recording. Previous studies showed that S1P excites capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors by increasing voltage-gated sodium currents and reducing steady-state potassium currents (Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). We found that S1P had no such effects on S1PR3+ medium-diameter cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E). By contrast, S1P triggered a robust increase in input resistance (Figure 5B), consistent with the closure of potassium channels. I-V analysis revealed that the current inhibited by S1P application was carried by potassium (Figure 5C). Additionally, S1P significantly reduced slow, voltage-dependent tail current amplitudes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F; Figure 5D (top)) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, center). As tail currents in Aδ neurons are primarily mediated by KCNQ2/3 potassium channels (Schütze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012), we postulated that S1P may alter tail currents through modulation of these channels. Furthermore, the above properties of the S1P-sensitive current were consistent with the reported electrophysiological properties of KCNQ2/3 channels in DRG neurons (Schütze et al., 2016; Crozier et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010). To address whether KCNQ2/3 channels mediated S1P-dependent neuronal excitability, we applied the KCNQ2/3-selective inhibitor XE 991 and found that it completely occluded the effects of S1P on tail current (Figure 5D). Similar results were observed with the related antagonist, linopirdine (Figure 5D). These findings are consistent with S1P/S1PR3-dependent inhibition of KCNQ2/3 in somatosensory neurons. We also found that the effect of S1P on KCNQ2/3 currents was mediated by low levels of S1P, exhibiting an IC50 of 48 nM with saturation at 100 nM (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). While S1P cannot be accurately measured in non-plasma tissues, this is similar to estimated levels of S1P in peripheral tissues (Schwab et al., 2005; Ramos-Perez et al., 2015), and to levels which rescued mechanosensitivity after local S1P depletion (Figure 2E). Thus, our in vitro IC50 supports our finding that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on mechanical pain. In summary, our electrophysiological and behavioral observations support a model in which baseline S1P/S1PR3 signaling governs mechanical pain thresholds through modulation of KCNQ2/3 channel activity in AM neurons. S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM nociceptors Given the effects of S1P on putative AM neurons in vitro and the selective attenuation of baseline mechanical pain in S1PR3 KO animals, we hypothesized that S1PR3 would play a role in AM afferent function. To test this, we utilized ex vivo skin-nerve recordings to analyze the effects of genetic ablation of S1PR3 on AM afferents, which mediate fast mechanical pain sensation. S1PR3 HET animals were used as littermate controls because no significant differences were observed between S1PR3 WT and S1PR3 HET mice in any behavioral assay (Figure 1), and because force-response relationships are comparable between S1PR3 HET AM fibers and wild type AM recordings (Osteen et al., 2016; McIlwrath et al., 2007; Kwan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; Garrison et al., 2012) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 6—source data 1). Compared to S1PR3 HET, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed reduced sensitivity in their force-response relation (slope for HET versus KO: 50 Hz/N versus 35 Hz/N), as well as attenuated firing over the noxious, but not innocuous, range of mechanical stimulation (Figure 6A). Strikingly, the median von Frey threshold to elicit firing in AM nociceptors was significantly higher in S1PR3 KO animals (3.92 mN) compared to littermate controls (1.56 mN; Figure 6B). Furthermore, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed a right-shifted cumulative response curve to force-controlled stimuli (50% effective force for HET versus KO: 33.7 versus 60.0 mN; Figure 6C), consistent with the mechanonociceptive hyposensitivity observed in vivo. By contrast, neither AM conduction velocities nor the conduction velocity distributions of Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers differed between genotypes (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Figure 6. S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM nociceptors.

(C) Mean firing rates during dynamic (ramp) and static (hold) stimulation for S1PR3 HET and S1PR3 KO recordings (left, Adapting AMs; right, Non-Adapting AMs; see Figure 6E–F for experimental details). No significant differences were found between genotypes (p=0.227, 0.490 (two-way ANOVA); bars, means). As shown in Figure 6F, the proportion of Adapting AMs was significantly lower in S1PR3 KO recordings compared with littermate controls. Open in a new tabA recent study reported that A-nociceptors are composed of two genetically distinct neuronal populations that differ in conduction velocity and in adaptation properties (Arcourt et al., 2017) (‘Adapting AM’ versus ‘Non-adapting AM’). We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than to static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than their static firing frequency (Arcourt et al., 2017) (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapting AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a significantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls (Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These ‘non-responders’ only fired action potentials to high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey filaments (see Methods). The Non-adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-firing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population of AM nociceptors. S1PR3 is required for inflammatory pain hypersensitivity Having examined the mechanisms of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in acute mechanonociception, we next sought to evaluate S1P/S1PR3 signaling in pain hypersensitivity. For this purpose, we used an experimental model of inflammatory pain triggered by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hindpaw, which elicits infiltration of immune cells and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). While one previous study proposed that S1PR3 promotes injury-evoked heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, they did not measure or compare post-injury mechanical thresholds to pre-injury baselines for the knockout or control animals (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013). Here, we compared development of CFA-evoked hypersensitivity between S1PR3 HET and KO littermates, since no significant behavioral differences were observed between WT and HET animals in CFA experiments (pvon Frey = 0.12; pradiant heat = 0.12; two-tailed t-tests). Strikingly, S1PR3 KO mice failed to develop thermal hypersensitivity (Figure 7A; see Figure 7—source data 1) relative to heterozygous littermates at both 24 and 48 hr post-CFA injection. In stark contrast, S1PR3 KO animals developed robust mechanical hypersensitivity when thresholds were normalized to account for the dramatic baseline differences between knockouts and control animals (Figure 7B). Our data demonstrate that S1PR3 mediates baseline mechanical sensitivity and is not required for the development of CFA-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. Figure 7.

Open in a new tabInflux of myeloid lineage (Cd11b+/Ly6G-) cells is required for the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in the CFA model (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). In the immune system, S1P signaling via S1PR1 plays a key role in immune cell migration (Matloubian et al., 2004). Consistent with the development of mechanical hypersensitivity, flow cytometry experiments showed robust infiltration of immune cells into hindpaw skin from both S1PR3 KO and littermate controls (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B). These data suggest that the phenotypes observed in S1PR3 KO mice cannot be attributed to compromised immune cell infiltration. Next, we tested whether active S1P/S1PR3 signaling was required to maintain CFA-evoked thermal hypersensitivity using pharmacology. Acute blockade of S1P production with SKI II or S1PR3 with TY also reversed CFA heat hypersensitivity (Figure 7C), demonstrating that peripheral S1P actively signals via S1PR3 to promote CFA-evoked heat hypersensitivity. Furthermore, acute S1P/S1PR3 blockade with SKI II or TY elevated mechanical thresholds to pre-CFA, baseline levels (Figure 7D) showing that S1PR3 tunes mechanical pain under normal and inflammatory conditions. These results are consistent with the distinct roles for AM and C nociceptors in mechanical pain. Under normal conditions, AM nociceptors set mechanical pain thresholds (Osteen et al., 2016; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). By contrast, under inflammatory conditions, the combined activity of both non-sensitized AM fibers and sensitized C fibers determines overall post-inflammatory mechanical thresholds (Lennertz et al., 2012; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). Consistent with this model, acute blockade of S1P production or S1PR3 activity under normal conditions induces mechanical hyposensitivity and under inflammatory conditions returns mechanical sensitivity to normal levels.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We now show that S1P signaling via S1PR3 is a key pathway that tunes mechanical pain sensitivity. Overall, our data reveal two new key findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresholds. Depletion of baseline, endogenous S1P induces mechanical hyposensitivity and nanomolar levels of exogenous S1P are sufficient to restore normal mechanical pain sensitivity after depletion. Second, elevated micromolar S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote thermal, but not mechanical hypersensitivity. The effects of S1P on acute mechanical pain and thermal hypersensitivity are completely lost in S1PR3 knockout animals, which are otherwise normal with respect to other somatosensory behaviors. What is the local source of S1P in the skin that constitutively modulates mechanical pain? Even in the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P, while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons, immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 which are essential for S1P production (Chalfant and Spiegel, 2005). Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues (Pappu et al., 2007). While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P (Usoskin et al., 2015; Morita et al., 2015), future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin to regulate mechanical sensitivity and for increasing S1P under inflammatory/injury conditions to promote pain hypersensitivity. Recent studies have identified distinct populations of AM nociceptors that are required for mechanical pain (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017). Likewise, it was discovered that a subset of somatostatin-expressing spinal interneurons is required for mechanical pain transduction (Duan et al., 2014). Although these papers delineate the cells and circuitry of mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception in the periphery are poorly understood. While the identity of the transduction channel(s) in AM nociceptors remains enigmatic, understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate excitability will no doubt provide key insights into the function and specialization of the diverse subtypes of mechanosensitive nerve fibers. For example, although Piezo2-hypomorphic animals exhibit normal mechanical pain behaviors (Ranade et al., 2014), ex vivo skin-nerve recordings show that their AM nociceptors display decreased force-responsiveness (Ranade et al., 2014), and a recent study found that subpopulations of sensory neurons express different splice variants of Piezo2 that exhibit different force sensitivities (Szczot et al., 2017). These studies suggest that mechanosensitive neurons exhibit functional specialization on multiple levels. Our study demonstrates that S1PR3 is indispensable for normal function of AM nociceptors, including the adapting AM population, recently discussed in Arcourt et al., that innervates the epidermis and encodes noxious touch (Arcourt et al., 2017). We show that S1PR3 signaling modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate excitability of these A mechanonociceptors (Figure 8). Figure 8. Proposed model illustrating a key role for S1PR3 in regulating mechanical pain in AM nociceptors. Open in a new tab (Top) S1P promotes activation of S1PR3, which leads to inhibition of KCNQ2/3 currents and promotes normal mechanical pain sensitivity. (Bottom) Diminished S1P or S1PR3 antagonism alleviates inhibition of KCNQ2/3, leading to mechanical pain hyposensitivity. GPCR-mediated inhibition of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels is a well-known mechanism by which neuronal excitability is regulated (Passmore et al., 2003). Other studies have shown that KCNQ channels mediate excitability of Aδ fibers (Schütze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012) and are required for normal mechanonociceptive responses in dorsal horn neurons receiving Aδ input (Passmore et al., 2012), and that opening KCNQ2/3 channels directly with retigabine alleviates pain in vivo (Xu et al., 2010; Hayashi et al., 2014; Blackburn-Munro and Jensen, 2003). Our results not only complement previous work implicating KCNQ2/3 channels in pain, but also define the upstream mechanisms that promote the regulation of KCNQ2/3 channels to tune mechanical pain thresholds. Our data thus highlight S1PR3 as a novel and attractive target for the treatment of mechanical pain and describe a new signaling pathway regulating AM nociceptor excitability. Interestingly, the neurons that innervate the ultra-sensitive tactile organ of the star-nosed mole are highly enriched in transcripts for S1PR3 and KCNQ channels, as well as for a variety of other potassium channels (Gerhold et al., 2013). While it is difficult to directly examine the physiological basis for heightened mechanosensitivity in the star-nosed mole, S1PR3-dependent modulation of KCNQ may represent an important mechanism underlying the high tactile sensitivity of the star organ. Moreover, the link between S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 is echoed in single-cell RNA seq datasets from mouse DRG neurons, which show co-expression of S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015). These cells are distinct from the S1pr3/Trpv1 subset that mediates S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity. In addition to being transcriptionally distinct, we show that the mechanisms underlying S1P’s activities in these cells are functionally distinct. Finally, S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 are highly expressed in human sensory ganglia (Ray et al., 2018; Flegel et al., 2015) and recordings from human stem cell-derived sensory neurons show that KCNQ2/3 channels play a key role in mediating their excitability (Young et al., 2014). Thus S1PR3 signaling may represent a new target for modulating mechanical pain. Previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons focused on S1P-evoked excitation of small diameter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and pain behaviors triggered by elevated S1P. While our new data affirms the effects S1P in thermal nociceptors observed by others, our manuscript highlights a novel effect of baseline levels of S1P in modulation of rheobase and KCNQ2/3 currents in mechanonociceptors. We are also the first to examine the role of S1PR3 in a variety of somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions (non-injury, no algogen injection), and to demonstrate a key role for S1PR3 in mechanonociception. We also go beyond previous studies (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015) in showing that elevated S1P selectively promotes thermal and not mechanical hypersensitivity. Others have shown that there are distinct cells and molecular pathways that trigger thermal versus mechanical hypersensitivity. For example, thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model is dependent on TRPV1 ion channels (Caterina et al., 2000) and independent of immune cell infiltration (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). By contrast, infiltration of a subset of myeloid immune cells is required for mechanical hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). Here we show that S1P via S1PR3 signaling is a key component of the inflammatory soup that triggers thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model. Our observation that S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell infiltration and develop mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA is consistent with these previous studies showing distinct mechanisms of inflammatory thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. Outside of the nervous system, S1P signaling via S1PR1 allows for the continuous circulation of lymphocytes between blood, lymph, and peripheral tissues (Matloubian et al., 2004). Our findings that S1P plays a key role in noxious mechanosensation are in line with recent studies showing that sensory neurons co-opt classical immune pathways to drive chronic itch or pain (Oetjen et al., 2017; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2017). What distinguishes this study from the others is that S1P signaling is critical for acute mechanical pain, even in the absence of inflammation or exogenously elevated S1P. In the immune system, disruptions in S1P levels or S1PR1 signaling result in significant immune dysfunction and disease (Donoviel et al., 2015; Gräler and Goetzl, 2004; Olivera et al., 2013). Accordingly, in the somatosensory system, excessive, high levels of S1P (micromolar), such as those present in inflammation, evokes thermal pain and sensitization. Intermediate, baseline levels (nanomolar) regulate AM excitability and are required for normal mechanical pain sensation. By contrast, lowering S1P levels reduces mechanical pain sensation, while sparing innocuous touch sensation. We propose that S1PR3 signaling may contribute to a variety of inflammatory diseases. S1P has been linked to a wide range of human inflammatory disorders (Allende et al., 2011; Kunkel et al., 2013; Roviezzo et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2013; Rivera et al., 2008; Myśliwiec et al., 2017; Checa et al., 2015). Canonically, S1P signaling via S1PR1 is thought to promote inflammation via the immune system (Kunkel et al., 2013), however, we propose that S1P signaling via S1PR3 in neurons may also contribute to inflammatory disease. Indeed, fingolimod, a non-selective S1PR modulator, is prescribed as an immunosuppressant for multiple sclerosis treatment (Brinkmann et al., 2010), but the possibility that some of its therapeutic effects may also be mediated via the nervous system has not been fully explored. Likewise, one study found that intrathecal fingolimod reduces bone cancer pain (Grenald et al., 2017), and while analgesia was attributed to effects on S1PR1 in glia, some of the benefits may be due to S1PR3 signaling in DRG neurons. S1PR3 antagonism may also be useful in the treatment of inflammatory pain due to its selective dampening of acute mechanical pain and inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity, while preserving innocuous touch and normal thermal sensitivity. S1PR3 inhibitors may also be beneficial for treating other inflammatory disorders where S1PR3-expressing somatosensory neurons have been shown to contribute to neurogenic inflammation, such as asthma (Tränkner et al., 2014). Our study demonstrates a crucial role for S1P signaling in the peripheral nervous system and highlights the potential of S1PR3 as a target for future pain therapies.",

Copyright notice ID: 5896955 PMID: 29561262 Abstract Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds. Research organism: MouseIntroduction Pain is a complex sensation. It serves to protect organisms from harmful stimuli, but can also become chronic and debilitating following tissue injury and disease. Distinct cells and molecules detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Thermal pain is detected by thermosensitive TRP channels in subsets of nociceptors (Caterina et al., 2000; Vriens et al., 2011), and gentle touch is detected by Piezo2 channels in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) (Ranade et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2014). Aδ high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) have been shown to play a key role in responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017). Recent studies have shown that there are at least two populations of HTMRs that mediate responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. The Npy2r+ subpopulation of HTMRs mediates fast paw withdrawal responses to pinprick stimulation and terminates as free nerve endings in the epidermis (Arcourt et al., 2017). The Calca+ subpopulation of circumferential-HTMRs responds to noxious force and hair pulling, and terminates as circumferential endings wrapped around guard hair follicles (Ghitani et al., 2017). Additionally, somatostatin-expressing interneurons of laminae I-III in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receive input from nociceptors and are required for behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli (Duan et al., 2014). Despite these advances in defining the cells and circuits of mechanical pain, little is known about the molecular signaling pathways in mechanonociceptors. Here, we show that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is required for mechanical pain sensation. S1P is a bioactive lipid that signals via 5 G-protein coupled S1P Receptors (S1PRs 1–5). S1P signaling, mainly via S1PR1, plays a well-known role in immune cell migration and maturation (Spiegel and Milstien, 2003; Matloubian et al., 2004; Schwab et al., 2005). Additionally, recent studies have shown that S1PRs are expressed throughout the nervous system (Janes et al., 2014; Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and S1P signaling is associated with a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., 2010) and Alzheimer’s disease (Couttas et al., 2014). S1P has been implicated in spontaneous pain (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013) and thermal pain hypersensitivity (Mair et al., 2011; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015), but due to conflicting accounts of S1P receptor expression in the CNS (Janes et al., 2014; Weth-Malsch et al., 2016) and PNS (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Usoskin et al., 2015) as well as inconsistent reports on the effects of S1P on neuronal excitability (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015) and pain behaviors (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015), the role of S1P in somatosensation remains controversial. We found that mice lacking the S1P receptor S1PR3 display striking and selective deficits in behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Likewise, peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signaling or S1P production impairs mechanical sensitivity. We show that S1P constitutively enhances the excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via closure of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels to tune mechanical pain sensitivity. The effects of S1P are completely dependent on S1PR3. While previous studies have shown that elevated S1P triggers acute pain and injury-evoked thermal sensitization (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), we now demonstrate that baseline levels of S1P are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, elevated S1P selectively triggers thermal sensitization via activation of TRPV1+ heat nociceptors, with no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings uncover an essential role for constitutive S1P signaling in mechanical pain.Results To identify candidate genes underlying mechanosensation, we previously performed transcriptome analysis of the sensory ganglia innervating the ultra-sensitive tactile organ (the star) of the star-nosed mole (Gerhold et al., 2013). Immunostaining revealed the tactile organ is preferentially innervated by myelinated Aδ fibers (Gerhold et al., 2013), which are primarily mechanosensitive. While our original analysis focused on ion channels enriched in the neurons of the star organ, our dataset also revealed enrichment of several components of the S1P pathway, including S1pr3. Likewise, single-cell RNA seq of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed S1pr3 expression in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015) in addition to a subpopulation of peptidergic C nociceptors. S1P promotes excitability in small-diameter, capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). In addition, S1PR3 has been shown to mediate spontaneous pain triggered by elevated S1P and thermal sensitization following sterile tissue injury (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013). However, no studies have examined the role of S1PR3 in mechanosensation or in regulating somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions. Given the enrichment of S1pr3 in mechanosensory neurons of the star-nosed mole and mouse, we hypothesized that S1P signaling via S1PR3 may also play a role in mechanosensation. Thus, we set out to define the role of S1P signaling and S1PR3 in somatosensory mechanoreceptors. S1PR3 mediates acute mechanical pain We first examined a variety of somatosensory behaviors in mice lacking S1PR3 (Kono et al., 2004) (S1pr3tm1Rlp/Mmnc; referred to herein as S1PR3 KO). We initially investigated baseline responses to mechanical stimuli. S1PR3 KO mice displayed a dramatic loss of mechanical sensitivity (Figure 1A; see Figure 1—source data 1), as von Frey paw withdrawal thresholds were significantly elevated in S1PR3 KO mice relative to WT and S1PR3 HET littermates (mean thresholds: 1.737 g vs. 0.736 and 0.610 g, respectively). Moreover, S1PR3 KO mice demonstrated decreased responses to a range of noxious tactile stimuli (2–6 g; Figure 1B) and to noxious pinprick stimulation (Figure 1C), but normal responsiveness to innocuous tactile stimuli (0.6–1.4 g; Figure 1B). S1PR3 KO mice exhibited normal tape removal attempts (Ranade et al., 2014) (Figure 1D), righting reflexes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), radiant heat withdrawal latencies (Figure 1E), and itch-evoked scratching (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). These results demonstrate a selective role for S1PR3 in acute mechanical pain. Figure 1. S1PR3 mediates acute mechanical pain.

Open in a new tabAs a complement to our analysis of somatosensation in S1PR3 KO animals, we employed a pharmacological approach, using the S1PR3-selective antagonist TY 52156 (TY) (Nussbaum et al., 2015). Similar to the phenotype of knockout animals, intradermal injection of 500 µM TY into the mouse hindpaw (the site of testing) triggered a rapid and significant elevation in von Frey paw withdrawal thresholds (Figure 1F) and decreased responsiveness to noxious (2–6 g), but not innocuous (0.6–1.4 g), tactile stimuli (Figure 1G), without affecting noxious heat sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). By contrast, blockade of S1PR1 with the selective antagonist W146 (Finley et al., 2013) had no effect on baseline mechanical or thermal thresholds (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Overall, these data show that S1PR3 signaling sets mechanical pain sensitivity.Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain We next asked whether peripheral S1P was required for the S1PR3-dependent effects on mechanosensation. We decreased S1P levels via injection of the sphingosine kinase inhibitor SKI II to block local production of S1P (Chiba et al., 2010) or elevated S1P levels via intradermal injection of S1P and measured behaviors 30 min after injection. Decreasing local S1P levels with SKI II significantly reduced mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A; see Figure 2—source data 1), comparable to the hyposensitivity phenotype observed in S1PR3 KO mice (Figure 1A). Again, similar to what was observed in S1PR3 KO animals (Figure 1E), peripheral blockade of S1P production had no effect on baseline thermal sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Surprisingly, injecting exogenous S1P (10 µM; maximum solubility in saline vehicle) had no effect on mechanical sensitivity (Figure 2A–B). However, as previously reported (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), S1P injection triggered S1PR3-dependent thermal hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain (Figure 2C–D), demonstrating that the lack of effect on mechanical hypersensitivity is not due to problems with S1P delivery or degradation.

Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain.Related to Figure 2. elife-33285-fig2-data1.xlsx (49KB, xlsx) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.33285.006 These data support a model whereby S1P constitutively activates S1PR3 to set normal mechanical pain thresholds. To further test this model, we asked if the mechanical hyposensitivity elicited after endogenous S1P depletion (via SKI II) could be rescued by local injection of exogenous S1P. Indeed, we found that injection of exogenous S1P reversed SKI II-induced mechanical hyposensitivity in a dose-dependent manner, and observed a maximal effect with 200 nM S1P (Figure 2E). Although quantification of native S1P levels in skin is inaccurate owing to avid lyase activity (Shaner et al., 2009), our data establish that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain, such that increased S1P does not evoke mechanical hypersensitivity, but diminished S1P leads to mechanical hyposensitivity. These data show that constitutive activation of S1PR3 by S1P is required for normal mechanosensitivity.S1PR3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors Our behavioral data showing distinct roles for S1PR3 in mechanonociception and thermal hypersensitivity suggest that S1PR3 is expressed in distinct subsets of somatosensory neurons. While a previous study suggested that all somatosensory neurons express S1PR3 (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), single cell RNA seq data suggests S1pr3 is not expressed by all DRG neurons (Usoskin et al., 2015), and no studies have performed quantitative analysis of S1PR3 staining or co-staining to define subpopulations of S1PR3+ neurons. We thus set out to characterize the somatosensory neuron subtypes expressing S1pr3 using in situ hybridization (ISH) of wild-type somatosensory ganglia and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse (Sanna et al., 2016). We first used in situ hybridization (ISH) with a specific S1pr3 probe to examine expression patterns of S1pr3 (Figure 3A–B; see Supplementary file 1). In our experiments, 43% of cells from wild-type DRG expressed S1pr3. Co-ISH revealed that one population of S1pr3+ neurons represents Aδ mechanonociceptors (AMs). These cells expressed Scn1a (39.9% of all S1pr3+), a gene that encodes the Nav1.1 sodium channel, which mediates mechanical pain in Aδ fibers (Osteen et al., 2016). S1pr3+ cells also co-expressed Npy2r (20.4% of all S1pr3+), a marker of a subset of mechanonociceptive A fibers (Arcourt et al., 2017). S1pr3 was expressed in 70.6% of Scn1a+ cells and 72% of Npy2r+ cells, comprising a majority of both of these populations. Interestingly, a subset of cells co-expressed S1pr3 and the mechanically sensitive channel Piezo2, which is expressed by Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers (Ranade et al., 2014). The remaining S1pr3+ cells were Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ C nociceptors (67.1% of all S1pr3+), which are reported to overlap minimally with the Scn1a+ and Npy2r+ populations (Arcourt et al., 2017; Osteen et al., 2016). Figure 3. S1pr3 is expressed in A mechanonociceptors and C thermal nociceptors.

Open in a new tabWe next used an S1pr3mCherry/+ reporter mouse, which produces a functional S1PR3-mCherry fusion protein (Sanna et al., 2016), as an independent strategy to explore S1PR3 expression and localization. This strategy was used because we found that anti-S1PR3 antibodies showed broad immunoreactivity in DRG from mice lacking S1PR3, and so we instead used anti-DsRed antibodies to probe expression of the S1PR3 fusion protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We found that 42.4% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-Peripherin, demonstrating that S1PR3 is expressed in a subset of small-diameter neurons. We also observed that 69.5% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-NF200, which marks medium and large-diameter myelinated neurons. Furthermore, we observed that S1PR3+ cells were primarily of small to medium diameter (11.3–35.1 µm), whereas all cells in the DRG ranged from 11.3 to 53.9 µm. Overall, these data support the expression of S1PR3 in subsets of small-diameter thermal nociceptors and medium-diameter mechanonociceptors (Figure 3F). Additionally, no significant differences were observed between WT and S1PR3 KO DRG in number of Trpa1+, Trpv1+, Peripherin+, NF200+, or IB4+ cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C,F,G). The mean diameters of Trpv1+ neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, left), NF200+ neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G), or all neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, right) in WT versus KO DRG were not significantly different, suggesting no loss of major sensory neuronal subtypes in the S1PR3 KO. We then visualized S1PR3 expression in nerve fibers that innervate the skin using anti-DsRed antibodies in whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC; Figure 3D). The reporter animals showed no specific antibody staining in epidermal or dermal cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1I), and single-cell RNA seq of a diverse array of mouse epidermal and dermal cells corroborates this lack of expression (Joost et al., 2016). We observed overlap of S1PR3-expressing free nerve endings with NF200+ myelinated free nerves and NF200- putative C-fiber endings (Figure 3F), but did not observe expression of S1PR3 in NF200+ circumferential or lanceolate hair follicle receptors, or in putative Merkel afferents (Figure 3D–E). β-tubulin III, PGP9.5 (pan-neuronal markers), and NF200 staining in S1PR3 KO skin displayed patterns of epidermal and dermal innervation similar to WT skin, suggesting the phenotypes observed in the S1PR3 KO mice are not due to developmental loss of sensory neuronal innervation (pPGP9.5= 0.443 (n = 93, 38 fibers); pNefH = 0.405 (n = 61, 28 fibers); pBTIII = 0.353 (n = 104, 89 fibers); two-tailed t-tests based on average number of fibers per field of view). These results support expression of S1PR3 in subsets of myelinated A mechanonociceptors and unmyelinated C nociceptors that terminate as free nerve endings.S1P activates thermal nociceptors but not putative AMs Live imaging of cultured DRG neurons from adult reporter animals showed expression of S1PR3-mCherry fusion protein in 48.3% of neurons, mirroring our ISH and IHC results (Figure 4A). To examine the effects of S1P on A mechanonociceptors and C nociceptors, we performed ratiometric calcium imaging and electrophysiology on DRG cultures from reporter mice. Interestingly, only 56.1 ± 22.4% of mCherry-expressing neurons were activated by 1 µM S1P (Representative trace in Figure 4B; representative images in Figure 4C), which our dose-response showed to be the saturating concentration for calcium influx (Figure 4D; EC50 = 155 nM). All S1P-responsive neurons were also capsaicin-sensitive (n > 2000 neurons). And while sensory neurons from S1PR3 KO animals did not respond to S1P, as expected (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013), they exhibited capsaicin responses that were not significantly different from WT neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). The mean diameter of S1P-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 22.4 ± 1.0 µm, whereas the mean diameter of non-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 28.7 ± 3.2 µm (p=0.0002, two-tailed t-test). We also performed whole cell current clamp experiments and, consistent with other studies (Mair et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015), found that S1P evoked action potential firing in capsaicin-sensitive small diameter cells (Figure 4E). This shows that only the small-diameter, S1PR3+ putative nociceptors are excited by S1P. We next asked whether the S1PR3+ medium-large diameter neurons represent the mechanonociceptors observed by ISH (Figure 3A). To this end, we asked whether the spider toxin Hm1a, a selective activator of AM nociceptors (Osteen et al., 2016), triggers calcium influx in S1PR3-expressing trigeminal neurons. Indeed, we found that 44.2 ± 15.1% of Hm1a-responsive neurons expressed mCherry (Figure 4F), consistent with our staining showing expression of S1pr3 in AM nociceptors and the role of Hm1a-responsive neurons in mediating mechanical pain in vivo (Osteen et al., 2016).

We performed whole-cell current clamp on the medium-diameter S1pr3mCherry/+ dissociated DRG neurons (membrane capacitance = 61.05 ± 1.92 pF), which did not display S1P-evoked calcium influx (Figure 4B–C). In these cells, 1 µM S1P application did not change membrane potential (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 5—source data 1) or elicit firing in the absence of current injection (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Figure 5A). However, S1P dramatically lowered the threshold to fire action potentials (rheobase) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Figure 5. S1PR3 modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate AM excitability. All experiments were performed in S1pr3mCherry/+ or -/- DRG neurons.

Pre- and post-S1P currents were measured at the indicated voltage (−100 mV to +80 mV, 20 mV increments) following a +100 mV step (100 ms).

EC50 (48.8 nM), marked by thin dotted lines, was estimated from sigmoidal fit (thick dotted line). Open in a new tabWe then set out to determine the mechanism by which S1PR3 activity increases neuronal excitability using whole-cell voltage clamp recording. Previous studies showed that S1P excites capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors by increasing voltage-gated sodium currents and reducing steady-state potassium currents (Zhang et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). We found that S1P had no such effects on S1PR3+ medium-diameter cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E). By contrast, S1P triggered a robust increase in input resistance (Figure 5B), consistent with the closure of potassium channels. I-V analysis revealed that the current inhibited by S1P application was carried by potassium (Figure 5C). Additionally, S1P significantly reduced slow, voltage-dependent tail current amplitudes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F; Figure 5D (top)) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, center). As tail currents in Aδ neurons are primarily mediated by KCNQ2/3 potassium channels (Schütze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012), we postulated that S1P may alter tail currents through modulation of these channels. Furthermore, the above properties of the S1P-sensitive current were consistent with the reported electrophysiological properties of KCNQ2/3 channels in DRG neurons (Schütze et al., 2016; Crozier et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2010). To address whether KCNQ2/3 channels mediated S1P-dependent neuronal excitability, we applied the KCNQ2/3-selective inhibitor XE 991 and found that it completely occluded the effects of S1P on tail current (Figure 5D). Similar results were observed with the related antagonist, linopirdine (Figure 5D). These findings are consistent with S1P/S1PR3-dependent inhibition of KCNQ2/3 in somatosensory neurons. We also found that the effect of S1P on KCNQ2/3 currents was mediated by low levels of S1P, exhibiting an IC50 of 48 nM with saturation at 100 nM (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). While S1P cannot be accurately measured in non-plasma tissues, this is similar to estimated levels of S1P in peripheral tissues (Schwab et al., 2005; Ramos-Perez et al., 2015), and to levels which rescued mechanosensitivity after local S1P depletion (Figure 2E). Thus, our in vitro IC50 supports our finding that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on mechanical pain. In summary, our electrophysiological and behavioral observations support a model in which baseline S1P/S1PR3 signaling governs mechanical pain thresholds through modulation of KCNQ2/3 channel activity in AM neurons.S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM nociceptors Given the effects of S1P on putative AM neurons in vitro and the selective attenuation of baseline mechanical pain in S1PR3 KO animals, we hypothesized that S1PR3 would play a role in AM afferent function. To test this, we utilized ex vivo skin-nerve recordings to analyze the effects of genetic ablation of S1PR3 on AM afferents, which mediate fast mechanical pain sensation. S1PR3 HET animals were used as littermate controls because no significant differences were observed between S1PR3 WT and S1PR3 HET mice in any behavioral assay (Figure 1), and because force-response relationships are comparable between S1PR3 HET AM fibers and wild type AM recordings (Osteen et al., 2016; McIlwrath et al., 2007; Kwan et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2013; Garrison et al., 2012) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 6—source data 1). Compared to S1PR3 HET, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed reduced sensitivity in their force-response relation (slope for HET versus KO: 50 Hz/N versus 35 Hz/N), as well as attenuated firing over the noxious, but not innocuous, range of mechanical stimulation (Figure 6A). Strikingly, the median von Frey threshold to elicit firing in AM nociceptors was significantly higher in S1PR3 KO animals (3.92 mN) compared to littermate controls (1.56 mN; Figure 6B). Furthermore, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed a right-shifted cumulative response curve to force-controlled stimuli (50% effective force for HET versus KO: 33.7 versus 60.0 mN; Figure 6C), consistent with the mechanonociceptive hyposensitivity observed in vivo. By contrast, neither AM conduction velocities nor the conduction velocity distributions of Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers differed between genotypes (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Figure 6. S1PR3 is required for nociceptive responses of high-threshold AM nociceptors.

S1PR3 HET AM nociceptors display normal nociceptive responses. Related to Figure 6. (A) Mean firing rate of AM fibers in response to force controlled stimulation (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 mN) from Figure 6A, with additional data from one wild-type animal (nWT = 4 fibers) (WT: slope, 57 Hz/N, R (Vriens et al., 2011), 0.98; p=0.90, two-way ANOVA comparing HET and WT).

(C) Mean firing rates during dynamic (ramp) and static (hold) stimulation for S1PR3 HET and S1PR3 KO recordings (left, Adapting AMs; right, Non-Adapting AMs; see Figure 6E–F for experimental details). No significant differences were found between genotypes (p=0.227, 0.490 (two-way ANOVA); bars, means). As shown in Figure 6F, the proportion of Adapting AMs was significantly lower in S1PR3 KO recordings compared with littermate controls. Open in a new tabA recent study reported that A-nociceptors are composed of two genetically distinct neuronal populations that differ in conduction velocity and in adaptation properties (Arcourt et al., 2017) (‘Adapting AM’ versus ‘Non-adapting AM’). We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than to static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than their static firing frequency (Arcourt et al., 2017) (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapting AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a significantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls (Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These ‘non-responders’ only fired action potentials to high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey filaments (see Methods). The Non-adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-firing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population of AM nociceptors.S1PR3 is required for inflammatory pain hypersensitivity Having examined the mechanisms of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in acute mechanonociception, we next sought to evaluate S1P/S1PR3 signaling in pain hypersensitivity. For this purpose, we used an experimental model of inflammatory pain triggered by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hindpaw, which elicits infiltration of immune cells and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). While one previous study proposed that S1PR3 promotes injury-evoked heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, they did not measure or compare post-injury mechanical thresholds to pre-injury baselines for the knockout or control animals (Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013). Here, we compared development of CFA-evoked hypersensitivity between S1PR3 HET and KO littermates, since no significant behavioral differences were observed between WT and HET animals in CFA experiments (pvon Frey = 0.12; pradiant heat = 0.12; two-tailed t-tests). Strikingly, S1PR3 KO mice failed to develop thermal hypersensitivity (Figure 7A; see Figure 7—source data 1) relative to heterozygous littermates at both 24 and 48 hr post-CFA injection. In stark contrast, S1PR3 KO animals developed robust mechanical hypersensitivity when thresholds were normalized to account for the dramatic baseline differences between knockouts and control animals (Figure 7B). Our data demonstrate that S1PR3 mediates baseline mechanical sensitivity and is not required for the development of CFA-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. Figure 7.

S1PR3 KO animals display normal CFA-evoked immune cell recruitment. Related to Figure 7.

Sidak’s multiple comparisons were made between HET and KO for each cell type. Open in a new tabInflux of myeloid lineage (Cd11b+/Ly6G-) cells is required for the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in the CFA model (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). In the immune system, S1P signaling via S1PR1 plays a key role in immune cell migration (Matloubian et al., 2004). Consistent with the development of mechanical hypersensitivity, flow cytometry experiments showed robust infiltration of immune cells into hindpaw skin from both S1PR3 KO and littermate controls (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B). These data suggest that the phenotypes observed in S1PR3 KO mice cannot be attributed to compromised immune cell infiltration. Next, we tested whether active S1P/S1PR3 signaling was required to maintain CFA-evoked thermal hypersensitivity using pharmacology. Acute blockade of S1P production with SKI II or S1PR3 with TY also reversed CFA heat hypersensitivity (Figure 7C), demonstrating that peripheral S1P actively signals via S1PR3 to promote CFA-evoked heat hypersensitivity. Furthermore, acute S1P/S1PR3 blockade with SKI II or TY elevated mechanical thresholds to pre-CFA, baseline levels (Figure 7D) showing that S1PR3 tunes mechanical pain under normal and inflammatory conditions. These results are consistent with the distinct roles for AM and C nociceptors in mechanical pain. Under normal conditions, AM nociceptors set mechanical pain thresholds (Osteen et al., 2016; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). By contrast, under inflammatory conditions, the combined activity of both non-sensitized AM fibers and sensitized C fibers determines overall post-inflammatory mechanical thresholds (Lennertz et al., 2012; Abrahamsen et al., 2008). Consistent with this model, acute blockade of S1P production or S1PR3 activity under normal conditions induces mechanical hyposensitivity and under inflammatory conditions returns mechanical sensitivity to normal levels.Discussion We now show that S1P signaling via S1PR3 is a key pathway that tunes mechanical pain sensitivity. Overall, our data reveal two new key findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresholds. Depletion of baseline, endogenous S1P induces mechanical hyposensitivity and nanomolar levels of exogenous S1P are sufficient to restore normal mechanical pain sensitivity after depletion. Second, elevated micromolar S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote thermal, but not mechanical hypersensitivity. The effects of S1P on acute mechanical pain and thermal hypersensitivity are completely lost in S1PR3 knockout animals, which are otherwise normal with respect to other somatosensory behaviors. What is the local source of S1P in the skin that constitutively modulates mechanical pain? Even in the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P, while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons, immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 which are essential for S1P production (Chalfant and Spiegel, 2005). Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues (Pappu et al., 2007). While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P (Usoskin et al., 2015; Morita et al., 2015), future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin to regulate mechanical sensitivity and for increasing S1P under inflammatory/injury conditions to promote pain hypersensitivity. Recent studies have identified distinct populations of AM nociceptors that are required for mechanical pain (Arcourt et al., 2017; Ghitani et al., 2017). Likewise, it was discovered that a subset of somatostatin-expressing spinal interneurons is required for mechanical pain transduction (Duan et al., 2014). Although these papers delineate the cells and circuitry of mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception in the periphery are poorly understood. While the identity of the transduction channel(s) in AM nociceptors remains enigmatic, understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate excitability will no doubt provide key insights into the function and specialization of the diverse subtypes of mechanosensitive nerve fibers. For example, although Piezo2-hypomorphic animals exhibit normal mechanical pain behaviors (Ranade et al., 2014), ex vivo skin-nerve recordings show that their AM nociceptors display decreased force-responsiveness (Ranade et al., 2014), and a recent study found that subpopulations of sensory neurons express different splice variants of Piezo2 that exhibit different force sensitivities (Szczot et al., 2017). These studies suggest that mechanosensitive neurons exhibit functional specialization on multiple levels. Our study demonstrates that S1PR3 is indispensable for normal function of AM nociceptors, including the adapting AM population, recently discussed in Arcourt et al., that innervates the epidermis and encodes noxious touch (Arcourt et al., 2017). We show that S1PR3 signaling modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate excitability of these A mechanonociceptors (Figure 8). Figure 8. Proposed model illustrating a key role for S1PR3 in regulating mechanical pain in AM nociceptors. Open in a new tab (Top) S1P promotes activation of S1PR3, which leads to inhibition of KCNQ2/3 currents and promotes normal mechanical pain sensitivity. (Bottom) Diminished S1P or S1PR3 antagonism alleviates inhibition of KCNQ2/3, leading to mechanical pain hyposensitivity.GPCR-mediated inhibition of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels is a well-known mechanism by which neuronal excitability is regulated (Passmore et al., 2003). Other studies have shown that KCNQ channels mediate excitability of Aδ fibers (Schütze et al., 2016; Passmore et al., 2012) and are required for normal mechanonociceptive responses in dorsal horn neurons receiving Aδ input (Passmore et al., 2012), and that opening KCNQ2/3 channels directly with retigabine alleviates pain in vivo (Xu et al., 2010; Hayashi et al., 2014; Blackburn-Munro and Jensen, 2003). Our results not only complement previous work implicating KCNQ2/3 channels in pain, but also define the upstream mechanisms that promote the regulation of KCNQ2/3 channels to tune mechanical pain thresholds. Our data thus highlight S1PR3 as a novel and attractive target for the treatment of mechanical pain and describe a new signaling pathway regulating AM nociceptor excitability. Interestingly, the neurons that innervate the ultra-sensitive tactile organ of the star-nosed mole are highly enriched in transcripts for S1PR3 and KCNQ channels, as well as for a variety of other potassium channels (Gerhold et al., 2013). While it is difficult to directly examine the physiological basis for heightened mechanosensitivity in the star-nosed mole, S1PR3-dependent modulation of KCNQ may represent an important mechanism underlying the high tactile sensitivity of the star organ. Moreover, the link between S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 is echoed in single-cell RNA seq datasets from mouse DRG neurons, which show co-expression of S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors (Usoskin et al., 2015). These cells are distinct from the S1pr3/Trpv1 subset that mediates S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity. In addition to being transcriptionally distinct, we show that the mechanisms underlying S1P’s activities in these cells are functionally distinct. Finally, S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 are highly expressed in human sensory ganglia (Ray et al., 2018; Flegel et al., 2015) and recordings from human stem cell-derived sensory neurons show that KCNQ2/3 channels play a key role in mediating their excitability (Young et al., 2014). Thus S1PR3 signaling may represent a new target for modulating mechanical pain. Previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons focused on S1P-evoked excitation of small diameter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and pain behaviors triggered by elevated S1P. While our new data affirms the effects S1P in thermal nociceptors observed by others, our manuscript highlights a novel effect of baseline levels of S1P in modulation of rheobase and KCNQ2/3 currents in mechanonociceptors. We are also the first to examine the role of S1PR3 in a variety of somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions (non-injury, no algogen injection), and to demonstrate a key role for S1PR3 in mechanonociception. We also go beyond previous studies (Mair et al., 2011; Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013; Finley et al., 2013; Weth et al., 2015) in showing that elevated S1P selectively promotes thermal and not mechanical hypersensitivity. Others have shown that there are distinct cells and molecular pathways that trigger thermal versus mechanical hypersensitivity. For example, thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model is dependent on TRPV1 ion channels (Caterina et al., 2000) and independent of immune cell infiltration (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). By contrast, infiltration of a subset of myeloid immune cells is required for mechanical hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model (Ghasemlou et al., 2015). Here we show that S1P via S1PR3 signaling is a key component of the inflammatory soup that triggers thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model. Our observation that S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell infiltration and develop mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA is consistent with these previous studies showing distinct mechanisms of inflammatory thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. Outside of the nervous system, S1P signaling via S1PR1 allows for the continuous circulation of lymphocytes between blood, lymph, and peripheral tissues (Matloubian et al., 2004). Our findings that S1P plays a key role in noxious mechanosensation are in line with recent studies showing that sensory neurons co-opt classical immune pathways to drive chronic itch or pain (Oetjen et al., 2017; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2017). What distinguishes this study from the others is that S1P signaling is critical for acute mechanical pain, even in the absence of inflammation or exogenously elevated S1P. In the immune system, disruptions in S1P levels or S1PR1 signaling result in significant immune dysfunction and disease (Donoviel et al., 2015; Gräler and Goetzl, 2004; Olivera et al., 2013). Accordingly, in the somatosensory system, excessive, high levels of S1P (micromolar), such as those present in inflammation, evokes thermal pain and sensitization. Intermediate, baseline levels (nanomolar) regulate AM excitability and are required for normal mechanical pain sensation. By contrast, lowering S1P levels reduces mechanical pain sensation, while sparing innocuous touch sensation. We propose that S1PR3 signaling may contribute to a variety of inflammatory diseases. S1P has been linked to a wide range of human inflammatory disorders (Allende et al., 2011; Kunkel et al., 2013; Roviezzo et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2013; Rivera et al., 2008; Myśliwiec et al., 2017; Checa et al., 2015). Canonically, S1P signaling via S1PR1 is thought to promote inflammation via the immune system (Kunkel et al., 2013), however, we propose that S1P signaling via S1PR3 in neurons may also contribute to inflammatory disease. Indeed, fingolimod, a non-selective S1PR modulator, is prescribed as an immunosuppressant for multiple sclerosis treatment (Brinkmann et al., 2010), but the possibility that some of its therapeutic effects may also be mediated via the nervous system has not been fully explored. Likewise, one study found that intrathecal fingolimod reduces bone cancer pain (Grenald et al., 2017), and while analgesia was attributed to effects on S1PR1 in glia, some of the benefits may be due to S1PR3 signaling in DRG neurons. S1PR3 antagonism may also be useful in the treatment of inflammatory pain due to its selective dampening of acute mechanical pain and inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity, while preserving innocuous touch and normal thermal sensitivity. S1PR3 inhibitors may also be beneficial for treating other inflammatory disorders where S1PR3-expressing somatosensory neurons have been shown to contribute to neurogenic inflammation, such as asthma (Tränkner et al., 2014). Our study demonstrates a crucial role for S1P signaling in the peripheral nervous system and highlights the potential of S1PR3 as a target for future pain therapies.Materials and methods Key resources table.

Wherever possible, wild-type/heterozygous (S1pr3) littermate controls were used in behavioral experiments. Mice (20–25 g) were housed in 12 hr light-dark cycle at 21°C. Mice were singly housed one week prior to all behavioral experiments and were between 8–10 weeks at the time of the experiment. All mice were acclimated in behavioral chambers (IITC Life Sciences) on two subsequent days for 1 hr prior to all behavioral experiments. Itch and acute pain behavioral measurements were performed as previously described (Morita et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2013; Tsunozaki et al., 2013). Mice were shaved one week prior to itch behavior. Compounds injected: 500 µM TY 52156 (Tocris), 50 µM SKI II (Tocris), 0.2–10 µM S1P (Tocris, Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 mM chloroquine (Sigma), and 27 mM histamine (Tocris) in PBS with either 0.01–0.1% Methanol- (S1P) or 0.1–0.5% DMSO-PBS (all other compounds) vehicle controls. Pruritogens were injected using the cheek model (20 µL) of itch, as previously described (Shimada and LaMotte, 2008). Behavioral scoring was performed while blind to experimental condition and mouse genotype. All scratching and wiping behavior videos were recorded for 1 hr. Itch behavior was scored for the first 30 min and acute pain was scored for the first five minutes. Bout number and length were recorded. For radiant heat and von Frey hypersensitivity behavior, drugs were injected intradermally into the plantar surface of the hindpaw (20 µL). Radiant heat assays were performed using the IITC Life Science Hargreaves test system. Mechanical threshold was measured using calibrated von Frey monofilaments (Touch Test) on a metal grate platform (IITC). Von Frey was performed as previously described (Tsunozaki et al., 2013; Chaplan et al., 1994) using the up-down method (Dixon, 1965) while blinded to compound injected and genotype, or a descending force-series of 4 trials per force from 0.4 g to 6 g. Valid responses for both von Frey and radiant heat included fast paw withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of the affected paw, or flinching. For radiant heat and von Frey, mice were allowed to acclimate on platform for 1 hr before injection. Measurements were taken 15 min pre-injection and 20–30 min post-injection for all compounds used. The pinprick assay (Duan et al., 2014) was conducted on a von Frey testing platform (IITC). The mouse hindpaw was poked with a 31 g syringe needle without breaking the skin to induce fast acute mechanical pain. Each paw was stimulated 10 times with the needle, with five minutes rest in between trials, and the % withdrawal (fast withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of paw, squeaking, and/or flinching) was calculated from the total number of trials. The tape assay was conducted according to previously described methods (Ranade et al., 2014). Number of attempts to remove a 3 cm piece of lab tape was recorded for 10 min after manual tape application to the rostral back. Scorer and experimenter were blinded to genotype. For righting reflex measurements, age-matched S1pr3-/- and +/+ P6-7 neonates were used. Briefly, pups were overturned one at a time on the home cage lid while experimenter was blinded to genotype. The time to righting was measured to the nearest 1/10th of a second with a stopwatch. For the CFA model of hypersensitivity, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and injected with 15 µL CFA (Sigma) into one hindpaw using a Hamilton syringe (30 g) at 5pm. Radiant heat latencies and von Frey 50% withdrawal thresholds were recorded one day prior to CFA, the morning of CFA (prior to injection), and one and two days post-CFA. Von Frey measurements were acquired before radiant heat latencies, and mice were allowed a one-hour recovery period in home cage with access to food and water in between testing. Both ipsilateral and contralateral paw were measured. Experimenter was blind to genotype for injections and recording. All behavior experiments were carried out using age-matched or littermate cohorts of male mice and conducted between 8 am and 1 pm. Mice were tested in 4-part behavior chambers (IITC Life Sciences) with opaque dividers (TAP Plastics) with the exception of righting reflex measurements. Scratching and wiping behaviors were filmed from below using high-definition cameras. All experiments were performed under the policies and recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain and approved by the University of California, Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee.In situ hybridization (ISH) Fresh DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old mice, flash frozen in OCT embedding medium, and sectioned at 14 μm onto slides. ISH was performed using Affymetrix Quantigene ViewISH Tissue 2-plex kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with Type 1 (S1pr3) and Type 6 (all other) probes. The following probes against mouse mRNAs were created by Affymetrix and used for ISH: S1pr3, Scn1a, Npy2r, Piezo2, Trpv1, Trpa1.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of DRG DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for one hour. DRG were cryo-protected overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then cryosectioned at 12 μm onto slides. Briefly, slides were washed 3x in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100), blocked in 2.5% horse serum +2.5% BSA PBST, and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:1000 primary antibody in PBST +0.5% horse serum +0.5% BSA. Slides were washed 3X in PBS then incubated 1–2 hr at RT in 1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 3X in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Rabbit anti-S1PR3 (Abcam #38324; #108370), Mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma #N5389), Chicken anti-Peripherin (Abcam #39374). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 (Abcam #150117), Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher #A11039), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen #R37117). Isolectin B4 (IB4)-FITC (Enzo Life Sciences #ALX-650–001F-MC05) was also used. Slides were mounted in Fluoromount with No. 1.5 coverglass. Imaging of DRG ISH and IHC experiments, and all live-cell imaging, was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope with a Lambda LS-xl light source (Sutter Instruments). For DRG ISH and IHC analysis, images were analyzed using FIJI software. Briefly, DAPI-positive cells were circled and their fluorescence intensity (AFU) for all channels was plotted against cell size using Microsoft Excel software. Co-labeling analysis was performed using FIJI. Intensity thresholds were set based on the negative control (no probe) slide. Cells were defined as co-expressing if their maximum intensities exceeded the threshold for both channels of interest.IHC of sectioned skin Skin was dissected from 8 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at RT. DRG were cryo-protected overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then sectioned at 18 μm onto slides. Briefly, slides were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:1000 primary antibody in blocking buffer. Slides were washed 3X in PBS then incubated 45 min at RT in 1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 5X in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Chicken anti-NefH (Abcam #4680), Chicken anti-β-tubulin III (Abcam #107216), mouse anti-PGP9.5 (Abcam #8189). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 (Abcam #150117), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen #R37117), Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher #A11039). For co-localization analysis, only fibers for which >50% of the length of the visible fiber contained co-localized (white) pixels were counted. Image analysis was performed using FIJI.Whole mount skin IHC Staining was performed according to Marshall et al. (2016). Briefly, 8-week-old mice were euthanized and the back skin was shaved, depilated, and tape-stripped. The removed skin was fixed overnight in 4% PFA, then washed in PBS (3X for 10 min each). Dermal fat was scraped away with a scalpel and skin was washed in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100; 3X for two hours each) then incubated in 1:500 primary antibody (Rabbit anti DsRed: Clontech #632496; Chicken anti-Nefh: Abcam #4680) in blocking buffer (PBST with 5% goat serum and 20% DMSO) for 5.5 days at 4°C. Skin was washed as before and incubated in 1:500 secondary antibody (Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594; Invitrogen #R37117; Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488; ThermoFisher #A11039) in blocking buffer for 3 days at 4°C. Skin was washed in PBST, serially dried in methanol: PBS solutions, incubated overnight in 100% methanol, and finally cleared with a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol: benzyl benzoate (BABB; Sigma) before mounting between No. 1.5 coverglass. Sectioned and whole mount skin samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with OPO using a 20x water objective. Image analysis was performed using FIJI.Cell culture Cell culture was carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Briefly, neurons from dorsal root ganglia (2–8 week old adults) or trigeminal ganglia (P0) were dissected and incubated for 10 min in 1.4 mg ml−1 Collagenase P (Roche) in Hanks calcium-free balanced salt solution, followed by incubation in 0.25% standard trypsin (vol/vol) STV versene-EDTA solution for 2 min with gentle agitation. Cells were then triturated, plated onto Poly D-Lysine coated glass coverslips and used within 20 hr. Media: MEM Eagle's with Earle's BSS medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (vol/vol), MEM vitamins, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine.Calcium imaging Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Cells were loaded for 60 min at room temperature with 10 µM Fura-2AM supplemented with 0.01% Pluronic F-127 (wt/vol, Life Technologies) in a physiological Ringer’s solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 10 D-(+)-glucose, pH 7.4. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Acquired images were displayed as the ratio of 340 nm/ 380 nm. Cells were identified as neurons by eliciting depolarization with high potassium Ringer’s solution (75 mM) at the end of each experiment. Responding neurons were defined as those having a > 15% increase from baseline ratio. Image analysis and statistics were performed using automated routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Fura-2 ratios were normalized to the baseline ratio F340/F380 = (Ratio)/(Ratio t = 0).In vitro electrophysiology Electrophysiological experiments were carried out as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Briefly, recordings were collected at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz (Axopatch 200B, pClamp software). Electrode resistance ranged between 1.5–5 MΩ. Internal solution contained 140 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM Na2ATP, 100 µM GTP, and 100 µM cAMP (pH 7.4). Bath solution was physiological Ringer’s solution. The pipette potential was canceled before seal formation. Cell capacitance was canceled before whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. For mechanonociceptors experiments, only cells which were visually identified as mCherry expressing and which had a capacitance between 40–80 pF were used. Rheobase was calculated as the smallest current step required to elicit an action potential using current steps of 50 pA. M currents were measured and analyzed using standard protocols for DRG neurons reported in the literature (Schütze et al., 2016; Crozier et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2013). Experiments were carried out only on cells with a series resistance of less than 30 MΩ. Analysis of electrophysiology data was performed in pClamp and IgorPro.Ex vivo skin-nerve electrophysiology Touch-evoked responses in the skin were recorded after dissecting the hind limb skin and saphenous nerve from 7 to 10 week old mice, according to published methods (Wellnitz et al., 2010; Maksimovic et al., 2014). The skin was placed epidermis-side-up in a custom chamber and perfused with carbogen-buffered synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) kept at 32°C with a temperature controller (model TC-344B, Warner Instruments). The nerve was kept in mineral oil in a recording chamber, teased apart, and placed onto a gold recording electrode connected with a reference electrode to a differential amplifier (model 1800, A-M Systems). The extracellular signal was digitized using a PowerLab 8/35 board (AD Instruments) and recorded using LabChart software (AD Instruments). For these studies, we focused on A-mechanonociceptors (AMs). To identify responses from these afferents in mutant and control genotypes, we used a mechanical search paradigm with a fine glass probe. Afferents were classified as AMs according to the following criteria: (1) conduction velocity (approximately, one to (≤12 m/ s−1), (2) medium-sized receptive fields, (3) sustained response to mechanical indentation (Wellnitz et al., 2010; Koltzenburg, 1997; Zimmermann et al., 2009). Touch-sensitive afferents that did not meet these criteria were not analyzed further. Responses were classified as Adapting AMs if the ratio of mean firing rate in the dynamic phase of stimulation (first 0.2 s) to the static phase of stimulation (last 4.8 s) was greater than 2, and Non-Adapting AMs if the ratio was less than or equal to 2. Non-responders (Figure 6F) responded to suprathreshold mechanical stimulation with von Frey monofilaments (tip diameter <0.5 mm), but not to maximal controlled mechanical stimulation (256 mN, tip diameter 2 mm). All recordings and analyses were performed blind to genotype. Mechanical responses were elicited with von Frey monofilaments and a force controlled custom-built mechanical stimulator. Mechanical thresholds were defined as the lowest von Frey monofilament to reliable elicit at least on action potential. Force controlled mechanical stimuli were delivered using a computer controlled, closed-loop, mechanical stimulator (Model 300C-I, Aurora Scientific, 2 mm tip diameter). Low-pass filtered, 5 s long, length control steps (square wave) simultaneously delivered with permissive force control steps (square wave) were generated using LabChart software (AD Instruments). An arbitrarily selected force step-and-hold protocol (8, 32, 4, 64, 128, 16, 256 mN) was delivered to all fibers. The period between successive displacements was 60 s. Conduction velocity was measured by electrically stimulating identified receptive fields. Spike sorting by principal component analysis (PCA) and density based clustering, and data analysis was performed off-line with custom-made software in MATLAB. Statistics were performed in Prism.Flow cytometry of CFA-treated hind paws CFA injections were performed as described above. Briefly, hindpaw skin and underlying fascia of treated and PBS-injected paws were removed from freshly euthanized mice. Skin was placed in RPMI media (Gibco) on ice before mincing with dissection scissors. Digestions were performed for 90 min at 37°C on a rotating platform in 1 mL RPMI supplemented with 1:1000 DNaseI enzyme (Roche) and one unit LiberaseTM (Roche). Skin was then filtered through 70 µm nylon mesh (Falcon), washed in RPMI, and resuspended in PBS for Aqua Live-Dead staining. Samples were then transferred to FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), blocked, then surface stained with the following antibodies: cKit-Biotin, FceRI-PE, CD49b-PECy7, SiglecF-APC, SA-FITC, Ly6C-PerCP, CD11b-PB, Ly6G-BV785, CD45.2-AF700. Compensation tubes (single-stain) were prepared for each fluorophore using positive and negative control beads. A spleen from a wild-type animal was also prepared by crushing between frosted glass slides, straining through 70 µm nylon mesh, and lysing of erythrocytes in ACK (Gibco). A portion of spleen sample was heat-killed for 10 min at 65°C and stained with Aqua viability stain and set aside. The rest of the spleen was stained normally with the other skin samples. Samples were then run through a flow cytometer (BD Fortessa). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Prism) and Microsoft Excel. Neutrophils were defined as live single cells with the following staining profile: CD45.2+/CD11b+/Ly6G+/Ly6C+. Inflammatory monocytes were defined as the following: CD45.2+/CD11b+/Ly6G-/Ly6Chigh. Total number of immune cells was reported, rather than percentage of total, since neither genotype differed significantly in total number of live cells or total number of CD45.2+ immune cells.Statistical analyses All statistical analyses, except for skin nerve data (see above), were performed using IgorPro software or Microsoft Excel. Values are reported as the mean ±SEM where multiple independent experiments are pooled and reported (for whole cell electrophysiology), and mean ±SD where one experiment was performed with multiple wells (for calcium imaging) or mice (for behavior). For comparison between two groups, Student’s unpaired 2-tailed t-test was used. A paired t-test was employed only for measurements within the same biological replicate and after a given treatment. For single-point comparison between >2 groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc test was used, depending on comparison. For the time course comparison between two groups, 2-way ANOVA was used and single comparison p-values were derived using Tukey’s HSD or appropriate statistical test, depending on comparison. Number of mice or samples required to attain significance was not calculated beforehand, and where multiple statistical tests were performed, a Bonferroni correction was applied. In figure legends, significance was labeled as: n.s., not significant, p≥0.05; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.Acknowledgements We thank Z Rifi (UC Berkeley) for assistance with scoring itch behavior, R P Dalton (UC Berkeley) for assistance with confocal microscopy, and P Lishko and M Miller (UC Berkeley) for advice on lipid stability and usage.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.[Editors’ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.] Thank you for submitting your work entitled \"The signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate regulates mechanical pain\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce P Bean (Reviewer #3). Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in eLife. Although the reviewers found merit in the study, a number of serious concerns were raised, and it is our editorial opinion that these concerns cannot be adequately addressed in the time frame set by eLife policy. Reviewer #1: In this manuscript, the authors characterized the role of sphingosine 1-phoshate receptor 3 (S1PR3), a candidate gene from an earlier study to screen for genes enriched in mechanosensory neurons, specifically in mechanical pain sensation. They show that (1) S1PR3 knockout mice show decreased sensitivity for noxious but not innocuous mechanical pain stimuli, (2) injection of either an S1PR3 antagonist or a kinase inhibitor that blocks S1P production also increases withdrawal thresholds, (3) S1PR3 expression in DRG partially overlaps with Npy2r, Piezo2, and Nav1.1, which marks mechosensory DRG neurons, (4) Adelta mechnosensitive fibers show decreased firing rates upon mechanical stimulation in ex vivo skin nerve preparations, and (5) S1P application blocks KCNQ2/3-mediated tail currents in dissocated DRG neuron recordings. While these studies identify an interesting new pathway that sets mechanical pain thresholds, and the authors performed a number of convincing experiments to suggest a role for S1P signaling in Adela fiber physiology, there are a few unresolved questions about the data presented. 1) Mechanical sensation usually occurs very quickly, while GPCR signaling is usually much slower. For behavior assays, the authors injected pharmacological reagents at least 30 minutes ahead of time. Thus, it doesn't seem to be very possible that S1P/S1PR3 signaling occurs when VFH was applied to the skin and modulate the mechanical sensitivity in ms. It is more likely that there is a constant baseline ongoing S1P/S1PR3 signaling that helps to set the mechanical pain threshold. How does it exactly happen? Where is the resource of this constant ligand? The authors will need to clarify their ideas/model more in the text. 2) Much of the evidence for the author's model relies on a global knockout mouse. As discussed above, if S1P/S1PR3 signaling is ongoing, would a global null mouse cause developmental deficit or other nonspecific effects that may explain the phenotype? It is also unclear the cell types/location responsible for the phenotype. While the authors do show an acute behavioral effect of a local injection of a S1PR3 antagonist and a blocker of S1P production, it does not exclude that some phenotypes they observed come from developmental deficits. Their overall model would be strengthened by a more careful characterization of the mutant mice. Use of a conditional knockout could address these concerns, either by an inducible Cre to delete S1PR3 in adulthood or restricting deletion to AM fibers. If this is not feasible, the authors could better characterize the knockout mouse, such as expression of known pain genes in DRG neurons or AM fibers, peripheral and central innervations, etc., and the developmental expression of S1PR3 in DRG neurons. For example, if S1PR3 is only expressed in adult DRG neurons, this developmental concern will be eased. 3) The characterization of S1PR3 expressing cells was only conducted to show its expression in AM neurons. It is fairly clear that this gene is expressed in other populations of DRG neurons. Based on the characterization provided, less than half of S1pr3+ neurons are AM fibers, while ~25% are Trpv1+ peptidergic neurons (although this data is not shown in the figure). Do LTMR types express S1pr3? A more thorough characterization of S1pr3 expression (NFH, peripherin, IB4, and other markers) and quantification would be helpful. Why don't the KO mice display deficits in other populations of expressing neurons? Some discussion/thoughts in this direction would be nice. Reviewer #2: The current study has demonstrated that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanical pain. Although the finding is largely consistent with a previous study (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013), the authors have provided more detailed mechanisms underlying S1P on DRG neurons. They found that S1Paffected A-delta mechanonociceptor excitability by modulating of KCNQ2/3 channels. Although the study is potentially interesting, there are some concerns need to be addressed. The result of S1P injection not affecting mechanosensitivity (Figure 2A) is very surprising. The authors explained that the endogenous S1P is sufficient to maximally exert its effect on S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain. However, a previous study has shown that S1P injection induced a dose dependent nociceptive response (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013). The author should do a more careful dose response study. Another experiment can be done is that co-injection of SKI II (sphingosine kinase inhibitor) with S1P to determine whether S1P increase the attenuated mechanosensitivity by SKI II. If it is true, it suggests that S1P constitutively activates S1PR3. The same previous study (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013) has shown that S1PR3 in situ is expressed in nearly all DRG neurons and the staining is completely gone in S1PR3 knockout DRG (Figure 6A in that study). The authors should employ a different approach to reconcile the discrepancy such as using S1PR3mcherry/+ mice. Why did they use P0 TG of S1PR3mcherry/+ mice to do Ca2+ imaging in response to Hm1a (Figure 3F)? Why not use adult DRG neurons? mCherry imaging in Figure 3F is not convincing. A better image from DRG should be provided. Only S1PR3 heterozygous mice were used in AM recording experiments. Wild type mice should be used to see the full extent of S1PR function (Figure 4). Reviewer #3: This manuscript reports on the involvement of the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in regulating DRG neuron excitability and pain behavior acting via the S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3). The key findings are that S1PR3-/- mice have diminished sensitivity to mechanical pain (von Frey hairs), that SP1R3 mRNA is expressed in ~40-50% of all DRG neurons, and that in SP1R3-/- mice, the response to von Frey hairs is diminished in single unit recordings from skin-nerve preparations. In addition, the authors find that S1P applied to cultured DRG neurons enhances excitability, which they propose results from closure of Kv7 channels. They propose that in vivo, endogenous S1P is high enough of produce basal closure of Kv7 channels. The manuscript has interesting results. However, it has two serious deficiencies. One is its failure to acknowledge how much the findings overlap with previously published work, most notably with Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013. This paper is cited in the manuscript but only in a negative manner, saying that the antibodies used in that paper were found in the present work to be non-specific. There is failure to acknowledge the many results in the Camprubi-Robles paper that overlap with the results in this manuscript, including the reduced sensitivity to mechanical pain in SP1R3-/- mice, and demonstration using ISH of mRNA in many DRGS neurons (which included a nice use of SP1R3-/- mice as a control, just as in the current manuscript). Also, the authors fail to mention a series of papers from the Nicol lab showing involvement of S1P and S1PRs in pain, including showing that S1P enhances excitability of DRG neurons by reducing a potassium current and also enhancing TTX-resistant sodium current (Zhang et al.,. 2006) and that this effects is diminished using siRNA targeted to S1PR1 and SIPR2 receptors (Li et al., 2015). A second major deficiency is in the analysis of the ionic mechanism underlying the increase in excitability reported here (and in the previous papers) by S1P applied to DRG neurons. The authors attribute this to closure of Kv7 channels (M-current). The evidence for this particular mechanism is very weak. The standard protocol for M-current is recording the slowly-deactivating outward tail currents when stepping from a steady holding potential of around -40 mV or -30 mv to around -60 mV. Here, the authors measure tail currents at -80 mV following steps to +100 mV. It is very hard to interpret these currents. It does not make sense to try to measure KV7 currents repolarizing to -80 mV, because the driving force on K is so small. In any case, I could not understand in Figure 5D how the authors were making the measurements or what the currents are. There is a sequence of fast-decaying current followed by a slowly-increasing outward current. This looks nothing like a recording of M-current (which would be a monotonically slowly-decaying outward current). The only evidence for it being mediated by Kv7 channels is occlusion by 100 μm linopirdine. This is of doubtful selectivity. The standard inhibitor of M-current (Kv2/Kv3) is XE-991, which acts with an IC50 of less than 1 uM. This attribution of the increase in excitability by S1P to Kv7 inhibition is all the more unconvincing in light of the previous work done, which is not mentioned. Zhang et al. (2006, above) found that S1P both inhibited a high-threshold voltage-activated K current (clearly not Kv7 from its voltage dependence) and also enhanced TTX-resistant sodium channels, and Camprubi-Robles found that S1P induces a large inward current at holding potential of -80 mV (clearly not closing Kv7 channels, which would already be closed at this voltage), which they attributed to activation of chloride channels. The overall impression from all the work is that multiple conductances are affected. The evidence for closure of Kv7 channels being important is probably the least strong of any of the conductances implicated. In my opinion, the manuscript cannot be published in its present form, based on the lack of discussion (and often, even acknowledgement) of closely related previous work and the weakness of the attribution of the S1P effects exclusively to inhibition of Kv7 channels. [Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.] Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled \"The signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate regulates mechanical pain\" for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. These are relatively minor and upon resubmission the changes to the manuscript will be evaluated by the Reviewing Editor. 1) The new experiments with a conventional voltage protocol for M-current are convincing, and the new panels in Figure 5 are very nice. However, now it is hard for the reader to understand Figure 5C and 5D carried over from the previous version, or what the difference in protocol was for the \"tail currents\" plotted in Figure 5C and 5D versus those in Figure 5E. The voltage protocols for Figure 5C and Figure 5D are not shown, and it is not explained where tail current was measured. This should be clarified in the Figure legend (based on the previous version, presumably currents were activated by steps to +80 or +100, but I was unclear then and am still unclear at what time after the repolarization to -80 mV the tail currents were measured.). The figure might now work better leaving out Figure 5C and 5D (or moving them to the Supplementary figure) but at the least the protocols and measurements need to be explained clearly. 2) It was hard to understand Figure 6E until going deep into Materials and methods section. It is not at all obvious from the traces in the hets why the top is classified as \"non-adapting\" and the bottom as \"adapting\". Both keep firing throughout the stimulus and both show much slower firing in the second half of the stimulus. In fact, the firing during the later stimulus is faster in the \"non-adapting\" fiber than in the \"adapting\" fiber, which seems confusing. One has to go to the Materials and methods section to realize that the distinction is when frequency falls by 2-fold from the initial frequency to the end, so the initial frequency must be much faster in the bottom trace than the top. It would be much clearer if the plots included a trace of frequency averaged over 200 ms intervals or something similar. If that doesn't fit well into the figure, at least the main text should explain the criterion that is being used, and maybe say something like \"the top trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell less than 2-fold over the 5-sec stimulus, to xx Hz. The bottom trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell to xx HZ by the end of the stimulus.\" 3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1E. \"(Left)% ∆ in peak instantaneous sodium current afterS1P\" – one assumes that it isn't \"instantaneous\" current but just \"peak sodium current\" during the depolarization that is plotted. 4) Subsection “Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain” \"that increased of S1P does not evoke…\" – delete \"of\".eLife. 2018 Mar 21;7:e33285. doi: 10.7554/eLife.33285.026 Author response Article notes Copyright and License information Collection date 2018.

Thus, it doesn't seem to be very possible that S1P/S1PR3 signaling occurs when VFH was applied to the skin and modulate the mechanical sensitivity in ms. It is more likely that there is a constant baseline ongoing S1P/S1PR3 signaling that helps to set the mechanical pain threshold. We agree with reviewer 1 that it is unlikely that mechanical force triggers rapid S1P release, and instead, agree that our data support a model wherein S1P/S1PR3 signaling constitutively sets the mechanical threshold. Consistent with this model, the dose-dependent effects of S1P that we measured on mechanonociceptors in vitro (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F) are saturated within the reported baseline levels of S1P in tissues in vivo (~100 nM; Ramos-Perez et al. 2015; Pappu et al. 2007). In addition, we provide new data in support of this model showing that 75-200 nM S1P is sufficient to reverse the mechanical hyposensitivity triggered by endogenous S1P depletion in vivo (Figure 2E; see response to Reviewer 2, comment 2). We have amended the Results and Discussion to highlight the data in support of a constitutive model. How does it exactly happen? Where is the resource of this constant ligand? The authors will need to clarify their ideas/model more in the text. We agree this is an interesting question. Indeed, this is a major research topic in immunology, where the role of S1P is well established. While we can’t answer this question, we have added the following discussion regarding the cellular source of S1P: “What is the local source of S1P in the skin that constitutively modulates mechanical pain? Even in the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P, while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons, immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, which are essential for S1P production (42). Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues (43). While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P (19, 44) future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin and regulating mechanical sensitivity.” 2) Much of the evidence for the author's model relies on a global knockout mouse. As discussed above, if S1P/S1PR3 signaling is ongoing, would a global null mouse cause developmental deficit or other nonspecific effects that may explain the phenotype? It is also unclear the cell types/location responsible for the phenotype. While the authors do show an acute behavioral effect of a local injection of a S1PR3 antagonist and a blocker of S1P production, it does not exclude that some phenotypes they observed come from developmental deficits. Their overall model would be strengthened by a more careful characterization of the mutant mice. Use of a conditional knockout could address these concerns, either by an inducible Cre to delete S1PR3 in adulthood or restricting deletion to AM fibers. We agree that conditional knockouts are best, but have made several attempts to generate these animals using a commercially-available S1PR3 “knockout-first” strain that have thus far failed. While we will pursue the creation of a new floxed line, we believe that our discovery of S1PR3 as a key mediator of mechanical pain in the global knockout is of immediate significance, given that we know little about the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical pain, but have provided additional, new data on the global knockout to support our claims (see below). If this is not feasible, the authors could better characterize the knockout mouse, such as expression of known pain genes in DRG neurons or AM fibers, peripheral and central innervations, etc., and the developmental expression of S1PR3 in DRG neurons. For example, if S1PR3 is only expressed in adult DRG neurons, this developmental concern will be eased. We agree that a more extensive characterization of the global KO would better support our findings. Indeed, we have seven new experiments, which suggest normal somatosensory neuron development in knockout animals: 1) the average diameters of S1PR3 KO and wild-type DRG cells are not statistically different (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), and neither are the diameters of Trpv1+C nociceptors (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D) or NF200+ myelinated neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G). 2) S1PR3 KO mice are not significantly different from WT animals with respect to IB4, NF200, or Peripherin staining of sectioned DRG (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G). 3) Expression of Trpv1 and Trpa1 transcripts is similar in S1PR3 KO and wild-type DRG sections (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). 4) Similar proportions of wild type and S1PR3 KO sensory neurons respond to capsaicin in ratiometric calcium imaging (Figure 3-figure supplement 1H). 5) PGP9.5, B-tubulin III, and NefH staining in S1PR3 KO skin displays expected patterns of innervation (see Results for statistical comparison). 6) S1PR3 KO and wild-type animals display similar proportions of A-beta, A-delta (including AM nociceptors), and C fibers as measured by conduction velocity in ex vivo skin-nerve recordings (Figure 6-figure supplement 1B). Thus while we see a reduction in mechanically sensitive AM fibers by controlled force stimulation (Figure 6E-F), we observe them in normal proportions based on conduction velocity and suprathreshold von Frey stimulation. 7) We show that the mCherry reporter animals display no S1PR3 expression in epidermal and dermal cells (Figure 3D-F), and single-cell RNA seq of a diverse array of mouse skin cells corroborates this lack of expression (Joost et al. 2016). In addition, we also performed a battery of behavioral tests and found no baseline defects in sensations mediated by proprioceptors, low-threshold mechanoreceptors, thermal nociceptors, or pruriceptors in the KO animals (Figure 1). These findings in the global knockout animal suggest that baseline S1P/S1PR3 signaling is selectively required for mechanical pain and does not affect other modalities. Overall, these experiments suggest that the phenotypes we observe in S1PR3 KO are not due to generalized defects in somatosensory development or function. Beyond the somatosensory system, S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell distribution and recruitment in a model of inflammatory pain (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-B). 3) The characterization of S1PR3 expressing cells was only conducted to show its expression in AM neurons. It is fairly clear that this gene is expressed in other populations of DRG neurons. Based on the characterization provided, less than half of S1pr3+ neurons are AM fibers, while ~25% are Trpv1+ peptidergic neurons (although this data is not shown in the figure). Do LTMR types express S1pr3? A more thorough characterization of S1pr3 expression (NFH, peripherin, IB4, and other markers) and quantification would be helpful. We have now performed a thorough ISH characterization to better characterize S1pr3-expressing cell types, including the use of new markers. These data show there are two main populations of S1pr3+ neurons: Scn1a+ mechanonociceptors (39.9% of S1pr3+), and Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ (67.1%) thermal nociceptors (Figure 3A-B). Staining of sectioned DRG, which is now included, shows that S1PR3 overlaps with Peripherin-expressing small-diameter neurons and IB4+ nociceptors as well as NF200+ medium-large myelinated neurons (Figure 3C,F). Our whole mount and sectioned skin staining suggests that S1PR3 is not expressed in Merkel afferents or NefH+ hair follicle nerve endings (Figure 3D-E), which comprise subsets of LTMRs, but is rather expressed in NefH+ and NefH-free nerve endings, which comprise AMs and C nociceptors, respectively. Why don't the KO mice display deficits in other populations of expressing neurons? Some discussion/thoughts in this direction would be nice. Our original manuscript dealt only with AMs and mechanical pain; however, we have also carried out an extensive set of experiments investigating mechanisms of S1P signaling in thermal pain. Consistent with previous studies (Camprubi-Robles et al. 2013) and our data showing expression of S1PR3 in thermal nociceptors, we see that elevated S1P triggers spontaneous pain that is absent in S1PR3 KO animals (Figure 2C-D), and S1P triggers excitation of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors (Figure 4B-E). Importantly, we also go beyond these previous studies to show that elevated S1P and S1PR3 activity promote heat hypersensitivity in the CFA model (Figure 6A, C). Reviewer #2: The current study has demonstrated that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1- phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanical pain. Although the finding is largely consistent with a previous study (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013), the authors have provided more detailed mechanisms underlying S1P on DRG neurons. They found that S1Paffected A-delta mechanonociceptor excitability by modulating of KCNQ2/3 channels. Although the study is potentially interesting, there are some concerns need to be addressed. The result of S1P injection not affecting mechanosensitivity (Figure 2A) is very surprising. The authors explained that the endogenous S1P is sufficient to maximally exert its effect on S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain. However, a previous study has shown that S1P injection induced a dose dependent nociceptive response (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013). The author should do a more careful dose response study. Our previous manuscript focused solely on the effects of S1P signaling on mechanical pain, which is saturated by baseline levels of S1P (~200 nM). However, consistent with Camprubi-Robles et al., that reported spontaneous pain to 500 µM S1P, our dose response study shows that elevated S1P (2 µM or higher) triggers spontaneous pain in the cheek model (Figure 2C). While this other study did not measure mechanical or thermal hypersensitivity after S1P injection, our new data now show that the spontaneous pain behaviors induced by elevated S1P are due to heat and not mechanical hypersensitivity and that hypersensitivity is dependent on S1PR3 (Figure 2A-B, D). Overall, our data reveal two key, novel findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresholds. Second, elevated S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote heat hypersensitivity, but not mechanical hypersensitivity. Another experiment can be done is that co-injection of SKI II (sphingosine kinase inhibitor) with S1P to determine whether S1P increase the attenuated mechanosensitivity by SKI II. If it is true, it suggests that S1P constitutively activates S1PR3. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed this experimentin vivo and found that injection of S1P does indeed reverse SKI II-induced mechanical hyposensitivity and observe a maximal effect with 200 nM S1P. This finding that exogenous S1P is sufficient to reverse the mechanical hyposensitivity triggered by the depletion of endogenous S1P supports a model whereby S1P constitutively regulates mechanical pain. The same previous study (Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013) has shown that S1PR3 in situ is expressed in nearly all DRG neurons and the staining is completely gone in S1PR3 knockout DRG (Figure 6A in that study). The authors should employ a different approach to reconcile the discrepancy such as using S1PR3mcherry/+ mice. We have now performed a thorough ISH characterization to better characterize S1pr3-expressing cell types, including the use of new markers. These data show there are two main populations of S1pr3+ neurons: Scn1a+ mechanonociceptors (39.9% of S1pr3+), and Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ (67.1%) thermal nociceptors (Figure 3A-B). Staining of sectioned DRG, which is now included, shows that S1PR3 overlaps with Peripherin-expressing small-diameter neurons and IB4+ nociceptors as well as NF200+ medium-large myelinated neurons (Figure 3C,F). Our staining data complement findings from a recent single-cell RNA-seq study showing expression of S1pr3 in two populations comprising a subset of DRG neurons: the NF200+ myelinated mechanoreceptors and peptidergic nociceptors (Usoskin et al. 2015). Unfortunately, we cannot make direct comparisons of our data to theirs, as they did not examine co-localization with other markers. And although they conclude that S1pr3 is expressed by “virtually all” somatosensory neurons, they did not quantify S1pr3 expression in wild type ganglia. Regardless, we now provide extensive new data, which, combined with our previous data, supports selective expression of S1PR3 primarily in two neuronal subsets: mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors. Why did they use P0 TG of S1PR3mcherry/+ mice to do Ca2+ imaging in response to Hm1a (Figure 3F)? Why not use adult DRG neurons? mCherry imaging in Figure 3F is not convincing. A better image from DRG should be provided. Our use of P0 TG was based on the original characterization of Hm1a by Osteen and colleagues (Osteen et al. 2016) who reported that PGE2 sensitization is required to see robust and sustained Hm1a-evoked calcium influx in adult DRG neurons, but that Hm1a robustly activates naive P0 trigeminal ganglion neurons (due to faster inactivation kinetics in the adult). Thus, after consultation with Dr. Julius, we used P0 neurons to avoid the added complication of pre-sensitizing neurons that could change excitability. We have added the following passages to the results (p.8) and figure caption (Figure 4), and also provide a clearer, more representative image to replace the previous version (Figure 4F): “To this end, we asked whether the spider toxin Hm1a, a selective activator of AM nociceptors (28), triggers calcium influx in S1PR3-expressing trigeminal neurons. Indeed, we found that 44.2 ± 15.1% of Hm1aresponsive neurons expressed mCherry (Figure 4F), consistent with our staining showing expression of S1pr3 in AM nociceptors and the role of Hm1a-responsive neurons in mediating mechanical pain in vivo (28).” “Figure 4F. (Left) Fura-2 AM calcium imaging after addition of 500 nM Hm1a in S1pr3mCherry/+ P0 TG neurons. TG neurons were used in calcium imaging instead of adult DRG neurons because they maximally respond to Hm1a without prior PGE2 sensitization, due to slower sodium channel inactivation kinetics. Right-hand image indicates mCherry fluorescence. (Right)% of Hm1a-responsive P0 TG neurons that are mCherry+ (N = 1 animal, 1230 total neurons).” Only S1PR3 heterozygous mice were used in AM recording experiments. Wild type mice should be used to see the full extent of S1PR function (Figure 4). We now include recordings from S1PR3 WT AM fibers, which do not significantly differ from S1PR3 HET fibers in mechanically-evoked responses to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6-figure supplement 1A), and cite a number of other studies on AM fibers that report similar force-response curves for their wild-type recordings (Osteen et al. 2016, Garrison et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2013, Hillery et al. 2011, Kwan et al. 2009, McIlwrath et al. 2007). This now allows for the direct comparison of the effects of S1PR3 signaling across genotypes. Reviewer #3: This manuscript reports on the involvement of the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in regulating DRG neuron excitability and pain behavior acting via the S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3). The key findings are that S1PR3-/- mice have diminished sensitivity to mechanical pain (von Frey hairs), that SP1R3 mRNA is expressed in ~40-50% of all DRG neurons, and that in SP1R3-/- mice, the response to von Frey hairs is diminished in single unit recordings from skin-nerve preparations. In addition, the authors find that S1P applied to cultured DRG neurons enhances excitability, which they propose results from closure of Kv7 channels. They propose that in vivo, endogenous S1P is high enough of produce basal closure of Kv7 channels. 1) The manuscript has interesting results. However, it has two serious deficiencies. One is its failure to acknowledge how much the findings overlap with previously published work, most notably with Camprubi-Robles et al., 2013. This paper is cited in the manuscript but only in a negative manner, saying that the antibodies used in that paper were found in the present work to be non-specific. There is failure to acknowledge the many results in the Camprubi-Robles paper that overlap with the results in this manuscript, including the reduced sensitivity to mechanical pain in SP1R3-/- mice… We agree that it is essential to put our data in the context of this study, especially since the scope of our studies is quite different: a distinction that was not highlighted adequately in our original manuscript that only discussed AMs and mechanical pain. Our previous manuscript focused solely on the effects of S1P signaling on mechanical pain, which is saturated by baseline levels of S1P (~200 nM). However, consistent with Camprubi-Robles et al., that reported spontaneous pain to 500 µM S1P, we also observe that elevated S1P (2 µM or higher) triggers spontaneous pain in the cheek model (Figure 2C). While this other study did not measure mechanical or heat hypersensitivity after S1P injection, our new data now show that the spontaneous pain behaviors induced by elevated S1P are due to heat and not mechanical hypersensitivity and that hypersensitivity is dependent on S1PR3 (Figure 2A-B, D). Overall, our data reveal two key, novel findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresholds. Second, elevated S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote heat hypersensitivity, but not mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition to clarifying our results in the context of these previous findings throughout the revised manuscript, we have also added a significant section to the discussion that puts our results in context with past studies: “Previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons focused on S1P-evoked excitation of small diameter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and pain behaviors triggered by elevated S1P. […] Our observation that S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell infiltration and develop mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA is consistent with previous studies showing distinct mechanisms of inflammatory thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity.” …[D]emonstration using ISH of mRNA in many DRGS neurons (which included a nice use of SP1R3-/- mice as a control, just as in the current manuscript). Unfortunately, we cannot make direct comparisons of our data to theirs, as they did not examine co-localization with other markers. And although they conclude that S1pr3 is expressed by “virtually all” somatosensory neurons, they did not quantify S1pr3 expression in wild type ganglia. Regardless, we now provide extensive new data, which, combined with our previous data, supports selective expression of S1PR3 in two neuronal subsets: mechanonociceptors and thermal nociceptors. We have now performed a thorough ISH characterization to better characterize S1pr3-expressing cell types, including the use of new markers. These data show there are two main populations of S1pr3+ neurons: Scn1a+ mechanonociceptors (39.9% of S1pr3+), and Trpv1+ and/or Trpa1+ (67.1%) thermal nociceptors (Figure 3A-B). Staining of sectioned DRG, which is now included, shows that S1PR3 overlaps with Peripherin-expressing small-diameter neurons and IB4+ nociceptors as well as NF200+ medium-large myelinated neurons (Figure 3C,F). Our whole mount and sectioned skin staining suggests that S1PR3 is not expressed in Merkel afferents or NefH+ hair follicle nerve endings (Figure 3D-E), which comprise subsets of LTMRs, but is rather expressed in NefH+ and NefHfree nerve endings, which comprise AMs and C nociceptors, respectively. 2) Also, the authors fail to mention a series of papers from the Nicol lab showing involvement of S1P and S1PRs in pain, including showing that S1P enhances excitability of DRG neurons by reducing a potassium current and also enhancing TTX-resistant sodium current (Zhang et al., 2006) and that this effect is diminished using siRNA targeted to S1PR1 and SIPR2 receptors (Li et al., 2015). Our current work represents the first analysis of S1P signaling in AM nociceptors, and is distinct from work performed in these previous papers, for a number of reasons. All previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons, including those cited above, focused on small diameter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons. While our new data affirms the effects in thermal nociceptors observed by others (Figure 4B-E), our manuscript highlights a novel effect of S1P in modulation of rheobase and M current in mechanonociceptors. Moreover, the effects of S1P on excitability of mechanonociceptors are completely lost in the S1PR3 knockout (Figure 5A). We have added the following passages to the Results and Discussion to clarify this: “We next interrogated the molecular mechanism by which S1P signaling in AM nociceptors may regulate mechanical pain. […] Additionally, S1P significantly reduced slow, voltage-dependent tail current amplitudes (Figure 5D; Figure 5E (top)) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5D, center).” “Previous studies of S1P signaling in DRG neurons focused on S1P-evoked excitation of small diameter and/or capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and pain behaviors triggered by high S1P. While our new data affirms the effects S1P in thermal nociceptors observed by others, our manuscript highlights a novel effect of S1P in modulation of rheobase and KCNQ2/3 currents in mechanonociceptors.” 3) A second major deficiency is in the analysis of the ionic mechanism underlying the increase in excitability reported here (and in the previous papers) by S1P applied to DRG neurons. The authors attribute this to closure of Kv7 channels (M-current). The evidence for this particular mechanism is very weak. The standard protocol for M-current is recording the slowly-deactivating outward tail currents when stepping from a steady holding potential of around -40 mV or -30 mv to around -60 mV. Here, the authors measure tail currents at -80 mV following steps to +100 mV. It is very hard to interpret these currents. It does not make sense to try to measure KV7 currents repolarizing to -80 mV, because the driving force on K is so small. In any case, I could not understand in Figure 5D how the authors were making the measurements or what the currents are. There is a sequence of fast-decaying current followed by a slowly-increasing outward current. This looks nothing like a recording of M-current (which would be a monotonically slowly-decaying outward current). The only evidence for it being mediated by Kv7 channels is occlusion by 100 μm linopirdine. This is of doubtful selectivity. The standard inhibitor of M-current (Kv2/Kv3) is XE-991, which acts with an IC50 of less than 1 uM. This attribution of the increase in excitability by S1P to Kv7 inhibition is all the more unconvincing in light of the previous work done, which is not mentioned. Zhang et al. (2006, above) found that S1P both inhibited a high-threshold voltage-activated K current (clearly not Kv7 from its voltage dependence) and also enhanced TTX-resistant sodium channels, and Camprubi-Robles found that S1P induces a large inward current at holding potential of -80 mV (clearly not closing Kv7 channels, which would already be closed at this voltage), which they attributed to activation of chloride channels. The overall impression from all the work is that multiple conductances are affected. The evidence for closure of Kv7 channels being important is probably the least strong of any of the conductances implicated. We have performed new experiments that address these concerns. While we originally reported results using linopirdine and +100 to -80 mV voltage steps, we also performed experiments with the suggested M current recording protocol (-40 to -60 mV steps). Using this protocol, the effects of S1P on M current were completely occluded by XE-991 (Figure 5E). These results dovetail with previous studies showing that KCNQ2/3 channels mediate M currents in cultured A-delta neurons, which include AM nociceptors and D-hairs (Schutze et al. 2016; Crozier et al. 2013), and support our model wherein S1P/S1PR3 constitutively modulate M currents in AM nociceptors. In regard to the effects described by the aforementioned studies on thermal nociceptors (Figure 4B-E), we do not observe S1P-evoked excitation of or changes in sodium or steady-state potassium currents in mechanonociceptors (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C-E). These additional concerns are addressed above (see response to Reviewer 3 comment 1). See also our added results regarding S1P-evoked inhibition of KCNQ2/3 currents in mechanonociceptors: “As tail currents in Aδ neurons are primarily mediated by KCNQ2/3 potassium channels (30, 31), we postulated that S1P may alter tail currents through modulation of these channels. […] In summary, our electrophysiological and behavioral observations support a model in which baseline S1P/S1PR3 signaling governs mechanical pain thresholds through modulation of KCNQ2/3 channel activity in AM neurons (Figure 8).” [Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.] 1) The new experiments with a conventional voltage protocol for M-current are convincing, and the new panels in Figure 5 are very nice. However, now it is hard for the reader to understand Figure 5C and 5D carried over from the previous version, or what the difference in protocol was for the \"tail currents\" plotted in Figure 5C and D versus those in Figure 5E. The voltage protocols for Figure 5C and Figure D are not shown, and it is not explained where tail current was measured. This should be clarified in the Figure legend (based on the previous version, presumably currents were activated by steps to +80 or +100, but I was unclear then and am still unclear at what time after the repolarization to -80 mV the tail currents were measured.). The figure might now work better leaving out Figure C and D (or moving them to the Supplementary figure) but at the least the protocols and measurements need to be explained clearly. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to clarify Figure 5. For Figure 5C, used an IV protocol whereby we recorded the current from -100 to +80mV in incremental 20mV steps, before and after S1P application. We have now clarified this in the figure legend as follows: “C. The S1P-sensitive current is carried by potassium. The current-voltage relationship was determined by subtraction of the post-S1P current from the pre-S1P current and reverses at -60.125 mV; N = 6 cells. Data were fitted with a Boltzmann equation. Pre- and post-S1P currents were measured at the indicated voltage (-100mV to +80mV, 20mV increments) following a +100 mV step (100 ms). Current was quantified using the peak absolute value of the slowly-deactivating current 0-10 ms after stepping to indicated voltage. Unless indicated otherwise, all error bars represent mean ± SEOM. D. (Graphic, top) Averaged current traces of a single mCherry+ neuron in whole cell voltage clamp recording comparing tail currents (∆I tail) pre- and post-S1P using indicated voltage step protocol. (graphic, bottom) Averaged current traces of a single mCherry+ neuron in whole cell voltage clamp recording with XE991 treatment. Holding phase (-40 mV, 150 ms) was truncated in traces. (Left graph)% ∆ in outward tail current (average +/- SD after indicated treatments (1 µM S1P, 3 µM XE 991, or both) for S1pr3mCherry/+ medium-diameter neurons; (p = 0.58; one-way ANOVA; n = 6, 8, 14 cells) using protocol depicted at right. (Right graph)% ∆ in inward tail current after indicated treatments (LINO = 100 µM linopirdine) for S1pr3mCherry/+ medium-diameter neurons; (p = 0.47; two-tailed paired t-test; N = 12 cells).” As suggested, we have also moved Figure 5D to Figure 5—figure supplement 1F. The supplemental figure legend now reads: “F.% ∆ in inward tail current (∆I tail) after S1P or 1% DMSO vehicle application for S1pr3mCherry/+ and KO medium-diameter neurons using a pre-pulse stimulation of +80 mV followed by a step to -80 mV, where (∆I tail) was calculated by subtracting the steady-state current from the absolute peak of the slowly-deactivating current at -80 mV (p = 0.014; one-way ANOVA; N = 10, 13, 10 cells). Tukey Kramer post hoc p-values indicated on graph.” 2) It was hard to understand Figure 6E until going deep into Materials and methods section. It is not at all obvious from the traces in the hets why the top is classified as \"non-adapting\" and the bottom as \"adapting\". Both keep firing throughout the stimulus and both show much slower firing in the second half of the stimulus. In fact, the firing during the later stimulus is faster in the \"non-adapting\" fiber than in the \"adapting\" fiber, which seems confusing. One has to go to the Methods to realize that the distinction is when frequency falls by 2-fold from the initial frequency to the end, so the initial frequency must be much faster in the bottom trace than the top. It would be much clearer if the plots included a trace of frequency averaged over 200 ms intervals or something similar. If that doesn't fit well into the figure, at least the main text should explain the criterion that is being used, and maybe say something like \"the top trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell less than 2-fold over the 5-sec stimulus, to xx Hz. The bottom trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell to xx HZ by the end of the stimulus.\" We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to clarify Figure 6E and the corresponding main text. We have updated the figure to include the binned instantaneous firing-rate frequency and the caption now reads: “E. Representative traces and binned instantaneous firing frequencies (IFF; 200-ms bins) of Non-Adapting and Adapting AMs in response to force controlled stimulation (256 mN, top) for S1PR3 HET and KO mice; blue regions, dynamic phase of stimulation (200-ms).” We also modified the associated main text as follows (changes underlined): “A recent study reported that A-nociceptors are composed of two genetically distinct neuronal populations that differ in conduction velocity and in adaptation properties5 (“Adapting AM” versus “Non-adapting AM”). We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than their static firing frequency5 (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapting AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a significantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls (Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These “non-responders” only fired action potentials to high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey filaments (see Materials and methods section). The Non-Adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-firing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population of AM nociceptors.” Additionally, we have included a supplemental figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) to clarify the phenotype observed in S1PR3 KO Adapting AMs that is described by the new main text. The figure caption reads: “C. Mean firing rates during dynamic (ramp) and static (hold) stimulation for S1PR3 HET and S1PR3 KO recordings (left, Adapting AMs; right, Non-Adapting AMs; see Figure 6E-F for experimental details). No significant differences were found between genotypes (p = 0.227, 0.490 (two-way ANOVA); bars, means). As shown in Figure 6F, the proportion of Adapting AMs was significantly lower in S1PR3 KO recordings compared with littermate controls.” 3) Figure 5—figure supplement 1E. \"(Left)% ∆ in peak instantaneous sodium current afterS1P\" – one assumes that it isn't \"instantaneous\" current but just \"peak sodium current\" during the depolarization that is plotted. The figure legend now reads “% ∆ in peak sodium current”, as requested. 4) Subsection “Endogenous S1P mediates acute mechanical pain” \"that increased of S1P does not evoke…\" – delete \"of\". This portion of the main text now reads “that increased S1P does not evoke…”.

    "abstract": "Abstract The oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes. Keywords: Mechanosensitive ion channel, Heterologous expression, Xenopus laevis oocytes, Patch-clamp electrophysiology, Pressure-clamp",
    "introduction": "1 Introduction Oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) have been used for several decades for the expression of transporters and receptors from bacteria [1], plants [2, 3], and mammals [4–6] due to the simplicity and reliability of this experimental system [7]. Relatively low background ion channel activity [8], large size (1–1.5 mm), low cost, and ease of handling make these cells a favored system for the expression of human, plant and bacterial channels. Xenopus oocytes have also been used as a model system for the study of processes unrelated to ion transport such as apoptosis [9, 10], gene expression [11], the structure and function of the nuclear envelope [12] and many others [13]. While most mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) have been characterized under native conditions [14–16], we have recently expressed and characterized two MSCs in Xenopus oocytes, MscS from Escherichia coli and MSL10 from Arabidopsis thaliana [17, 18]. Our analyses were made possible by previous studies showing that the endogenous MSCs known to be present in the oocyte membrane [8, 19, 20] can be effectively blocked or inactivated [21, 22]. A number of useful papers on frog maintenance [23], oocyte expression and transport systems [3, 24–28], oocyte isolation, and the methods used for characterization of ligand- and voltage-gated channels in the Xenopus oocyte system [29–33] have been published to date. Here we focus on the methods we used for the heterologous expression and characterization of MscS and MSL10 at the single-channel level. We describe in detail the techniques for surgery, oocyte isolation and preparation, in vitro RNA production and injection into oocytes, and basics of MSC electrophysiology, including patch-clamp and pressure-clamp.",
    "methods": "3 Methods Surgery is not performed until cRNA has been made and quantified (see Subheading 3.3). This prevents unnecessary surgeries. The surgery and oocyte isolation occur on the same day and injections are done the following day. Our protocol for surgery and oocyte isolation is based on [34]. 3.1 Frog Surgery Immerse a frog in the MS-222/NaHCO3 solution for 10–15 min, until she does not respond to pinching of the skin between the toes. 13 min is optimal in our hands. Rinse the frog with pretreated animal facility water to remove the anesthetic from its skin. Put the frog on a wet paper towel and perform the surgery with sterile instruments, on a benchtop sterilized by spraying with 70 % ethanol, using sterile gloves. Keep the frog moist with sterile ND96 solution (see Note 4). Make a small incision through the skin of the abdomen, using sharp scissors, followed by an incision of about 1 cm in the muscle layer. Rinse with ND96. (If the skin is slippery, grasp it with two fingers through a piece of clean paper towel). Place a sheet of Parafilm with a square cut in the middle over the incision, so that oocytes extracted from the abdomen will not come in contact with the surface of the frog’s skin. Pull 2–4 ml of oocytes out of the body cavity with dull forceps and place in 25 ml of ND96 in a 50 ml conical tube. Repair the incision with two sets of sutures, one for the muscle tissue (undyed) and one for skin (black). Each stitch is made with two loops of single knots and a third loop of double knots (three stitches) per 1–1.5 cm incision. The last knot should be pulled tight, and the ends trimmed closely. Wash the frog with 0.5 L of clean water taken from the facility in order to get rid of any blood and anesthetic on her skin. Allow the frog to recover in 0.5 L of Pen Strep solution (5 ml of 100× Pen Strep stock in 0.5 L of treated water from the frog facility) for 40–60 min. Tilt the plastic bath 45° from the vertical so that most of the frog’s body is submerged in the buffer. Care must be taken that the frog does not drown (keep her nostrils above the water level) but her skin stays wet. When she starts to move in response to pinching, she’s almost recovered. Once the frog recovers, return her to a clean cage with fresh water. Depending on institutional rules, a frog could be operated on up to 5 times, with the last operation terminal. The operations should be 4–6 weeks apart and alternating sides of the abdomen used. After the last operation the frog may be euthanized according to the rules of your institution (see Note 5). 3.2 Oocyte Isolation Separate the ovarian tissue into clumps of 10–20 oocytes each in a petri dish, using forceps and working under a stereomicroscope. Transfer the clumps into Ca2+ -free ND96. Try to avoid damage to the oocytes. Incubate the oocytes in a petri dish with slow shaking for 25–40 min at room temperature in 20 ml of Ca2+ -free ND96 with collagenase. Ca2+ -free medium is used to slow down the collagenase reaction as Ca2+ strongly activates collagenase [35]. Stop the process as soon as single oocytes are released. Wash the oocytes 5 times with 25 ml ND96 + 0.1 % BSA in a 50 ml conical tube. Add 25 ml 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6.5 buffer and incubate for 40–50 min on a slow shaker. At 15-min intervals, draw the oocytes into a wide-bore plastic pipette (made by trimming the tip) and pipette up and down to facilitate dispersal. Wash the oocytes 5 times with 25 ml ND96 + 0.1 % BSA in a 50 ml conical tube. Sort the oocytes in a petri dish under the microscope, selecting only mature oocytes (Dumont stage V-VI, [36]) with clear animal–vegetal pole divisions and without any spots, markings or residual ovarian tissue on the surface. Manipulate single oocytes with plastic transfer pipettes (see Subheading 2). Store the selected oocytes in complete ND96 with 50 mg/ml gentamycin at 16–18°C. 3.3 RNA Preparation The sequence of the RNA of interest should first be cloned into an expression vector appropriate for cRNA production and its translation in oocytes. We use pOO2, a vector that allows cloning of a cDNA in between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated β-globin sequences from Xenopus [37]. Linearize approximately 5 μg of template DNA in a 70 μl reaction. Use a restriction enzyme that recognizes a single site in the vector downstream of the sequence to be transcribed (see Note 6). Run 4 μl of the sample on a gel to ensure linearity. Add 5 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 4 μl 5 M NaCl, 25 μl RNase-free water and mix well. Add 200 μl 100 % ethanol. Mix well and place at −20°C for at least 20 min. Spin for 15 min on a benchtop centrifuge at top speed. Carefully remove supernatant and dry the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 25 μl RNase-free water and calculate the concentration of DNA by measuring the OD260. Follow the protocol supplied with Ambion mMessage mMachine kit to produce the cRNA of interest (see Note 7). Aliquot the cRNA solution (it should be approximately 1 μg/μl) into 3 μl aliquots and store at −20°C. 3.4 Oocyte Injection Place 10–40 oocytes into a gridded petri dish (see Fig. 1) filled with complete ND96. Place each oocyte into a square of the plastic grid with the light side (vegetal pole) up. Thaw RNase-free water and cRNA on ice. Pull long needles from 8 in. capillary glass on a puller. For a Sutter P-97 the following program may be a good starting point: heat = 560, pull = none, velocity = 120, time = 100. Trim the end of each needle with scissors 5–6 mm before the point where the pulled portion of the pipette becomes flexible. Backfill the needle with 13–15 μl of mineral oil using a micropipette, then apply the needle to the pipette or injector apparatus. Make sure there are no bubbles in the oil, then pull approximately 500 nl of RNase-free water into the tip from a drop placed on a petri dish, followed by all 3 μl of your cRNA sample (see Note 8). Using a microinjector or a micropipette attached to the glass needle (see Fig. 2), inject 50 nl of the cRNA solution into each oocyte, preferably into the light side and close to the animal/vegetative border (see Note 9). Repeat steps 4 and 5 above with fresh oocytes and RNase-free water as a negative control. Place the oocytes into a 6-well plate filled with complete ND96 with gentamycin. Change the solution and remove defective oocytes on a daily basis until analysis (see Notes 10 and 11). 3.5 Patch-Clamp The microscope stage setup, including a dish with bath medium, command and ground electrodes, patch pipette and a pressure clamp headstage, is presented in Figs. 3a (schematic view) and 4 (actual setup). Conventional single-channel patch-clamp is carried out using pipettes with BN (“bubble number”, see ref. 38) of 4–7 in symmetric and asymmetric buffers. Prior to patching, the transparent vitelline membrane of each oocyte should be removed with a pair of sharp forceps after 5–10 min incubation in hypertonic buffer, which makes the cell shrink and the vitelline membrane more visible (see Note 12). After removal of the vitelline membrane, the oocyte becomes very fragile, so it should not be exposed to the surface of the buffer and care should be taken when moving it. We suggest removing the vitelline membrane in the petri dish to be used for patch-clamp, already filled with patching bath buffer. A patch-pipette should be fabricated using a pipette puller (see appropriate manual for measuring glass melting temperature and initial proxy settings that can be adjusted to get the pipette of desired size and shape). Typically, a pipette with tip size between 0.5 and 2 µm is required, which corresponds to BN 4–6 and a resistance of several MΩ, depending on the tips’ length and geometry. The command (or pipette) electrode is a small piece of Ag wire that has been chlorinated either by immersion into 6 % bleach for 15–25 min or by subjecting it to proper potential in KCl buffer [ 39 ]. The ground electrode is an Ag/AgCl pellet, connected to the ground input of the amplifier’s headstage through the common ground (such as a Faraday cage or anti-vibration table) via Ag wire (see Note 13, Figs. 3a and 4). It does not matter where the electrode is grounded, only that everything metal be grounded at a single common point, with a stable electrical contact between the wires and grounding point. This can be tested with a standard multimeter. The ground electrode could be immersed into the bath solution directly or via an agar salt bridge (see Note 14). The Ag/AgCl pellet should be washed with distilled water after experiments are completed. Back-fill the patch-pipette with buffer, making sure it is free of air bubbles. If bubbles form, they can sometimes be eliminated by tapping the pipette. Bubbles can be prevented in the first place by pulling some buffer into the empty pipette with a syringe before back-filling the rest of the pipette. Before and during immersion of the pipette into the bath buffer, a positive pressure of 20–30 mmHg should be applied to it. After the pipette tip is immersed, the pressure may be lowered to 5–10 mmHg (see Note 15). Bring the pipette tip close to the oocyte membrane. The state of the pipette tip should be monitored by periodic application of low amplitude square voltage pulses of approximately 5 mV to the command electrode. In Axopatch amplifiers, use the “seal test mode”, where steps are gated by the amplifier’s internal line frequency oscillator. If the tip resistance grows (the current decreases) before the tip touches the oocyte membrane, replace the pipette, as its tip is likely obstructed with debris. The moment of touching the oocyte membrane is observed electrically as a decrease of the measured current. When it decreases to 2/3–1/2 of its initial value, stop pipette motion and immediately decrease the pressure in the pipette from slightly positive to about −10 mmHg. Observe the gradual formation of the “gigaseal” between the membrane and the pipette as the resistance of the pipettemembrane contact increases to 1 GΩ or more (see Note 16). After a gigaseal is reached you have obtained the cell-attached configuration (see Note 17). Next, bring the pipette pressure to between −1 and −3 mm Hg. Excise the patch by rapid removal of the pipette away from the oocyte membrane. If the patch is not stable, this may result in patch rupture. Alternatively a membrane vesicle may form in the pipette tip and block it (usually when the pipette is not moved away from the cell quickly enough, see Note 18). Once the patch is in the “excised” (in this particular case, “inside-out”) patch configuration (see Notes 19 and 20 and Fig. 3b), one can proceed to stimulation of MSCs. We recommend using a fixed transmembrane voltage of −20 to −40 mV and applying triangular 4- or 5-second-long symmetric ramps of negative pressure to the patch pipette, allowing for the gradual opening and closing of individual MSCs (see Note 21). A typical trace obtained from the membrane patch of an oocyte expressing MSL10 from A. thaliana [18] is presented in Fig. 3c for reference. Once a tension-induced channel activity is detected and recorded, be sure to repeat patch excision and current measurement on water-injected oocytes to ensure the absence of artifacts or unusually high endogenous channel activity. We have observed that the localization of the channel usually is not uniform within the oocyte membrane and several patches from the same cell may be necessary to locate channel activity, especially if a small pipette diameter is used. In our hands, the endogenous cation-selective MSCs that are often observed in the cell-attached configuration inactivate upon patch excision, especially in the presence of elevated MgCl2 or in TEA-Cl buffer (see Notes 22–24). The rare appearance of an endogenous, large-conductance Ca2+ -activated chloride channel (see ref. 8) should also be taken into account (see Note 25). However, it usually does not present a serious problem as long as small patch-pipettes are used, due to its relatively low expression. A good starting point for recording settings would include the following: (1) acquisition at 20 kHz with the amplifier’s low pass filter set to 5–10 kHz (depending on the available settings); (2) a 4–5 s pressure ramp of −20 to −80 mmHg (depending on the pipette size, see Note 26), which in most cases eliminates artifacts caused by a too rapid increase in tension; and (3) a holding potential of 20 mV to 40 mV (pipette voltage) for the inside-out configuration, which typically provides clean and artifact-free traces (see Notes 26 and 27). Once several channels are activated in the patch, one may study the channel’s voltage dependence. To do so, repeat the measurement with the same transmembrane pressure but at various potentials (see Note 28). Pressure may be gradually increased by increments of −10 to −40 mmHg in order to activate more channels in the patch and obtain a dose-response curve (see Note 29). For additional recommendations on data collection and statistical analysis, see Notes 30 and 31.",

While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes. Keywords: Mechanosensitive ion channel, Heterologous expression, Xenopus laevis oocytes, Patch-clamp electrophysiology, Pressure-clamp1 Introduction Oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) have been used for several decades for the expression of transporters and receptors from bacteria [1], plants [2, 3], and mammals [4–6] due to the simplicity and reliability of this experimental system [7]. Relatively low background ion channel activity [8], large size (1–1.5 mm), low cost, and ease of handling make these cells a favored system for the expression of human, plant and bacterial channels. Xenopus oocytes have also been used as a model system for the study of processes unrelated to ion transport such as apoptosis [9, 10], gene expression [11], the structure and function of the nuclear envelope [12] and many others [13]. While most mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) have been characterized under native conditions [14–16], we have recently expressed and characterized two MSCs in Xenopus oocytes, MscS from Escherichia coli and MSL10 from Arabidopsis thaliana [17, 18]. Our analyses were made possible by previous studies showing that the endogenous MSCs known to be present in the oocyte membrane [8, 19, 20] can be effectively blocked or inactivated [21, 22]. A number of useful papers on frog maintenance [23], oocyte expression and transport systems [3, 24–28], oocyte isolation, and the methods used for characterization of ligand- and voltage-gated channels in the Xenopus oocyte system [29–33] have been published to date. Here we focus on the methods we used for the heterologous expression and characterization of MscS and MSL10 at the single-channel level. We describe in detail the techniques for surgery, oocyte isolation and preparation, in vitro RNA production and injection into oocytes, and basics of MSC electrophysiology, including patch-clamp and pressure-clamp.2 Materials Special attention must be paid to water quality at several stages in this procedure. The water used for surgery solutions should be the same water in which the frog is maintained in the animal facility. Water used in buffers for oocyte isolation and patch-clamp should be distilled and filter-sterilized (0.2 μm) or autoclaved. Water used for complimentary RNA (cRNA) production must be DNase- and RNase-free. All solutions (apart from those made right before the experiment or requiring freezer storage) should be kept in a refrigerator. Gentamycin-containing buffers should be stored together with oocytes at 16–18°C. 2.1 Frog Surgery Anesthetic solution: 0.5-1 L of 1.5 g/L MS-222 (ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate) buffered with 840 mg/L NaHCO3 and dissolved in pretreated water from the animal facility.

This prevents unnecessary surgeries. The surgery and oocyte isolation occur on the same day and injections are done the following day. Our protocol for surgery and oocyte isolation is based on [34]. 3.1 Frog Surgery Immerse a frog in the MS-222/NaHCO3 solution for 10–15 min, until she does not respond to pinching of the skin between the toes. 13 min is optimal in our hands. Rinse the frog with pretreated animal facility water to remove the anesthetic from its skin. Put the frog on a wet paper towel and perform the surgery with sterile instruments, on a benchtop sterilized by spraying with 70 % ethanol, using sterile gloves. Keep the frog moist with sterile ND96 solution (see Note 4). Make a small incision through the skin of the abdomen, using sharp scissors, followed by an incision of about 1 cm in the muscle layer. Rinse with ND96. (If the skin is slippery, grasp it with two fingers through a piece of clean paper towel). Place a sheet of Parafilm with a square cut in the middle over the incision, so that oocytes extracted from the abdomen will not come in contact with the surface of the frog’s skin. Pull 2–4 ml of oocytes out of the body cavity with dull forceps and place in 25 ml of ND96 in a 50 ml conical tube. Repair the incision with two sets of sutures, one for the muscle tissue (undyed) and one for skin (black). Each stitch is made with two loops of single knots and a third loop of double knots (three stitches) per 1–1.5 cm incision. The last knot should be pulled tight, and the ends trimmed closely. Wash the frog with 0.5 L of clean water taken from the facility in order to get rid of any blood and anesthetic on her skin. Allow the frog to recover in 0.5 L of Pen Strep solution (5 ml of 100× Pen Strep stock in 0.5 L of treated water from the frog facility) for 40–60 min. Tilt the plastic bath 45° from the vertical so that most of the frog’s body is submerged in the buffer. Care must be taken that the frog does not drown (keep her nostrils above the water level) but her skin stays wet. When she starts to move in response to pinching, she’s almost recovered. Once the frog recovers, return her to a clean cage with fresh water. Depending on institutional rules, a frog could be operated on up to 5 times, with the last operation terminal. The operations should be 4–6 weeks apart and alternating sides of the abdomen used. After the last operation the frog may be euthanized according to the rules of your institution (see Note 5). 3.2 Oocyte Isolation Separate the ovarian tissue into clumps of 10–20 oocytes each in a petri dish, using forceps and working under a stereomicroscope. Transfer the clumps into Ca2+ -free ND96. Try to avoid damage to the oocytes. Incubate the oocytes in a petri dish with slow shaking for 25–40 min at room temperature in 20 ml of Ca2+ -free ND96 with collagenase. Ca2+ -free medium is used to slow down the collagenase reaction as Ca2+ strongly activates collagenase [35]. Stop the process as soon as single oocytes are released. Wash the oocytes 5 times with 25 ml ND96 + 0.1 % BSA in a 50 ml conical tube. Add 25 ml 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 6.5 buffer and incubate for 40–50 min on a slow shaker. At 15-min intervals, draw the oocytes into a wide-bore plastic pipette (made by trimming the tip) and pipette up and down to facilitate dispersal. Wash the oocytes 5 times with 25 ml ND96 + 0.1 % BSA in a 50 ml conical tube. Sort the oocytes in a petri dish under the microscope, selecting only mature oocytes (Dumont stage V-VI, [36]) with clear animal–vegetal pole divisions and without any spots, markings or residual ovarian tissue on the surface. Manipulate single oocytes with plastic transfer pipettes (see Subheading 2). Store the selected oocytes in complete ND96 with 50 mg/ml gentamycin at 16–18°C. 3.3 RNA Preparation The sequence of the RNA of interest should first be cloned into an expression vector appropriate for cRNA production and its translation in oocytes. We use pOO2, a vector that allows cloning of a cDNA in between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated β-globin sequences from Xenopus [37]. Linearize approximately 5 μg of template DNA in a 70 μl reaction. Use a restriction enzyme that recognizes a single site in the vector downstream of the sequence to be transcribed (see Note 6). Run 4 μl of the sample on a gel to ensure linearity. Add 5 μl 0.5 M EDTA, 4 μl 5 M NaCl, 25 μl RNase-free water and mix well. Add 200 μl 100 % ethanol. Mix well and place at −20°C for at least 20 min. Spin for 15 min on a benchtop centrifuge at top speed. Carefully remove supernatant and dry the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 25 μl RNase-free water and calculate the concentration of DNA by measuring the OD260. Follow the protocol supplied with Ambion mMessage mMachine kit to produce the cRNA of interest (see Note 7). Aliquot the cRNA solution (it should be approximately 1 μg/μl) into 3 μl aliquots and store at −20°C. 3.4 Oocyte Injection Place 10–40 oocytes into a gridded petri dish (see Fig. 1) filled with complete ND96. Place each oocyte into a square of the plastic grid with the light side (vegetal pole) up. Thaw RNase-free water and cRNA on ice. Pull long needles from 8 in. capillary glass on a puller. For a Sutter P-97 the following program may be a good starting point: heat = 560, pull = none, velocity = 120, time = 100. Trim the end of each needle with scissors 5–6 mm before the point where the pulled portion of the pipette becomes flexible. Backfill the needle with 13–15 μl of mineral oil using a micropipette, then apply the needle to the pipette or injector apparatus. Make sure there are no bubbles in the oil, then pull approximately 500 nl of RNase-free water into the tip from a drop placed on a petri dish, followed by all 3 μl of your cRNA sample (see Note 8). Using a microinjector or a micropipette attached to the glass needle (see Fig. 2), inject 50 nl of the cRNA solution into each oocyte, preferably into the light side and close to the animal/vegetative border (see Note 9). Repeat steps 4 and 5 above with fresh oocytes and RNase-free water as a negative control. Place the oocytes into a 6-well plate filled with complete ND96 with gentamycin. Change the solution and remove defective oocytes on a daily basis until analysis (see Notes 10 and 11). 3.5 Patch-Clamp The microscope stage setup, including a dish with bath medium, command and ground electrodes, patch pipette and a pressure clamp headstage, is presented in Figs. 3a (schematic view) and 4 (actual setup). Conventional single-channel patch-clamp is carried out using pipettes with BN (“bubble number”, see ref. 38) of 4–7 in symmetric and asymmetric buffers. Prior to patching, the transparent vitelline membrane of each oocyte should be removed with a pair of sharp forceps after 5–10 min incubation in hypertonic buffer, which makes the cell shrink and the vitelline membrane more visible (see Note 12).

Observe the gradual formation of the “gigaseal” between the membrane and the pipette as the resistance of the pipettemembrane contact increases to 1 GΩ or more (see Note 16). After a gigaseal is reached you have obtained the cell-attached configuration (see Note 17). Next, bring the pipette pressure to between −1 and −3 mm Hg. Excise the patch by rapid removal of the pipette away from the oocyte membrane. If the patch is not stable, this may result in patch rupture. Alternatively a membrane vesicle may form in the pipette tip and block it (usually when the pipette is not moved away from the cell quickly enough, see Note 18). Once the patch is in the “excised” (in this particular case, “inside-out”) patch configuration (see Notes 19 and 20 and Fig. 3b), one can proceed to stimulation of MSCs. We recommend using a fixed transmembrane voltage of −20 to −40 mV and applying triangular 4- or 5-second-long symmetric ramps of negative pressure to the patch pipette, allowing for the gradual opening and closing of individual MSCs (see Note 21). A typical trace obtained from the membrane patch of an oocyte expressing MSL10 from A. thaliana [18] is presented in Fig. 3c for reference.

In our hands, the endogenous cation-selective MSCs that are often observed in the cell-attached configuration inactivate upon patch excision, especially in the presence of elevated MgCl2 or in TEA-Cl buffer (see Notes 22–24). The rare appearance of an endogenous, large-conductance Ca2+ -activated chloride channel (see ref. 8) should also be taken into account (see Note 25). However, it usually does not present a serious problem as long as small patch-pipettes are used, due to its relatively low expression.

Pressure could be also applied to the patch-pipette manually using a syringe. Pressure in this case may be measured using a manometer. 3Pipettes should be made of alumosilicate or borosilicate glass. Pipettes with thicker walls made of harder glass usually produce lower noise. Additionally, the noise introduced by interactions at the glass–air–water interface could be decreased by coating the pipette tip with a silicone polymer. To do so, place a thin layer of Sylgard (Dow) on the pipette and induce polymerization with a stream of hot air or by contact with a heated metal coil. Capillaries containing an additional thin filament designed to facilitate filling with buffer are not recommended, as they typically result in higher noise levels and “patch creep” (upward movement of the membrane patch within the pipette tip) under applied pressure. 4One may also perform surgery on ice to enhance the anesthetic. Soaking a paper towel in anesthetic solution is not necessary and usually results in longer frog recovery time, but may be recommended for a beginner. Typically the surgery takes 15–20 min, from making the first incision to completed stitching. 5Euthanasia may be performed in 5 g/L solution of MS-222 for at least 15 min. Note, that your institution regulations may require much longer treatment (up to an hour). 6Linearity is essential for transcription and any uncut vector will greatly reduce the amount of cRNA produced. 7NTP/CAP and 10× reaction buffer should be mixed very well before use, and vortexing for over a minute is recommended. At this stage, RNase-free technique should be used: use only RNase-free certified tubes, wipe working surfaces with alcohol or RNase removing solutions, minimize contact of gloves with any objects apart from the tubes of the kit and cover the working space with paper towel when not in use. 8Care should be taken that the mineral oil does not directly contact the cRNA solution and is not injected into oocytes. To ensure this, approximately 500 nl of water should be pulled into the pipette tip prior to the cRNA solution. 9We have not observed a substantial difference in expression level depending on the location of cRNA injection. However, we do observe a higher number of channels per patch at the vegetal pole (light half). 10Analysis can take place as early as 24 h and as late as 14 (up to 21 in rare cases) days after injection. Dead or damaged oocytes release substances that appear to damage the remaining healthy cells, so it may be useful to split the cells into several groups for longer storage times. The indications that an oocyte is damaged include, in order of increasing severity: the appearance of bright spots on the animal pole (dark half), blurring of the animal/vegetal pole dividing line, substantially increased cell size, and the appearance of white material extruded from the cell. If the damage is not too severe, patching is still possible as only a small fraction of intact membrane is required. In the case of a heavily damaged oocyte it becomes impossible to remove the vitelline membrane without oocyte rupture. 11A good practice is to check for expression of the protein of interest. One option is to label the protein with a fluorescent tag (e.g., Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)) and check for signal from the periphery of the oocyte using a confocal microscope (see Fig. 5). This approach allows one to see if the fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane. Another option is to use a tagged version and to detect it via Western blotting (using, for example, the isolation method described in ref. 40). This approach allows one to evaluate level of expression more quantitatively, but is more time-consuming. 12If proper care is taken, this procedure could be carried out in regular ND96 buffer. 13It is important that the anti-vibration table, Faraday cage, and microscope with its stage all be in good electric contact, which insures the absence of electric interference from external sources. Our recommendation is to physically connect all pieces with metal wires, preferably in a single place (see Fig. 4). Noise levels may be monitored visually with a command electrode attached to the amplifier’s headstage via acquisition software; noise should be at least 2–3 times lower than the expected signal from a single channel opening (see patch-clamp amplifier manual for typical acceptable noise levels). Induced low-frequency modulations (50 or 60 Hz) are typically caused by loopbacks and can be eliminated by connecting all power cables to the same noise filter/surge suppressor. In many cases, noise can be reduced with acquisition software suites such as Clampfit (Molecular Devices). However, these approaches may result in partial data loss, and it is preferable to make the initial recording with minimal noise. Note that any additional equipment (such as peristaltic pumps for a perfusion system, manipulators, etc.) most likely will require grounding too. A detailed step-by-step procedure for testing the amplifier’s internal noise is usually described in the user manual and should be performed at least once during the initial amplifier setup. It is recommended to repeat this test from time to time during standard use. 14An agar bridge is an L-shaped glass capillary (the same diameter as used for patch-pipettes and bent in the flame of a gas burner) filled with 2–3 % agar in a 1 M KCl solution [41]. A heated agar solution is sucked into the capillary and then left to cool. The agar salt bridge should be rinsed with water and kept in salt solution in a fridge as it subject to bacterial invasion. If any signs of bacterial growth are detected, the bridge should be discarded and a new one made. 15It is also often recommended that during immersion of the tip into the buffer, a stream of air should be applied to the buffer surface by blowing on it. This is intended to move away any debris and fragments of lipid monolayers from the water–air interface. 16If this does not happen in a reasonable period of time (30–60 s) or at least a slow but steady growth of patch resistance is not observed, additional suction may be applied to the pipette (usually −20 to −50 mmHg), but it should not be very high as high suction may result in patch rupture (or inactivation for some kinds of MSCs). Additionally, a slightly negative potential (−10 to −20 mV) may be applied to the command electrode to facilitate “sealing” of the patch. 17At this point, it is already possible to carry out measurements of currents in response to increased membrane tension. However, to remove the complicating contributions of the cell’s resting potential, series resistance, and endogenous MSCs we recommend proceeding to the excised patch configuration for further measurements. 18The production of such a vesicle typically can’t be seen through the microscope (unless high magnification and DIC are used), but its formation results in a drop in current in response to high command potentials and the appearance of slow capacitive transient currents in response to voltage steps. Lifting the pipette tip into the air and then immediately immersing it into the bath buffer can disrupt the vesicle. If the vesicle collapses and the new seal is good, one can observe a slight increase of conductance. 19The inside-out excised patch preserves the orientation of the membrane leaflets—i.e., it is the same as it was in the moment the pipette touched the cell membrane. In certain cases the opposite orientation (when the outer leaflet of the patch faces the bath solution but not the inner volume of the pipette (outside-out configuration)) may be of interest. In order to achieve the outside-out configuration, one should obtain a proper gigaseal in the cell-attached mode and then rupture the patch with a short pulse of either high voltage or negative pressure, thus obtaining direct electric access to the inner volume of the cell (whole-cell mode). Rapid backward removal of the pipette from the cell in this case typically results in the production of a membrane patch in the outside-out configuration. Outside-out patches are often less stable than inside-out patches. 20The whole-cell mode is not of particular interest for characterization of MSCs in ooctyes due to a very high level of noise (caused by a huge size of the oocyte membrane) and high probability of membrane rupture under applied tension. 21Membrane tension for the patch in the pipette obeys the law of Laplas and therefore is proportional to transmembrane pressure and curvature radius of the membrane patch. Large patches formed in large pipettes require lower transmembrane pressure in order to be exposed to the same tension as small patches formed in small pipettes. 22The amount of endogenous MSC activity present in oocytes varies depending on the batch of oocytes, the frog, and the season of the year. Some scientists report that the season with the highest background activity is summer. Endogenous cation-selective MSCs may be inhibited by high concentrations of Mg2+ ions (see ref. 22) or very low concentrations of lanthanides (approximately 10 μM La3+ or Gd3+), strong blockers of calcium, potassium and many mechanosensitive channels (see ref. 21). However, it has been shown in the latter case that the inhibition of at least some non-selective MSCs (like MscS) by gadolinium is mediated by membrane lipids and may affect all MSCs at high enough levels [42]. 23If there are indications that the MSC of interest is non-selective or anion-selective, one may utilize tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) buffer to investigate the ion selectivity of the channel. The TEA+ molecule is a blocker of many potassium channels [43] and due to its size (approximately 8 Å) is not able to permeate smaller channels. In our hands it blocked endogenous potassium MSCs, permeated E. coli MscS and did not permeate nor block A. thaliana MSL10 [17, 18]. Symmetric 100 mM TEA-Cl buffer usually works well and provides a very clean background, but it also requires the addition of Mg2+ (or other divalent ions) to form a tight membraneglass seal. In extreme cases, when sealing does not occur, a buffer consisting of 50–60 mM MgCl2 only (with no other ions) may be an option. 24The formation of a seal between the membrane patch and the pipette occurs more slowly in TEA-Cl buffer. In order to facilitate the process, the concentration of MgCl2 in the buffer may be increased up to 20 mM. 25If this problem persists, the Ca2+ -activated chloride channel may be inhibited by exclusion of Ca2+ ions from the buffer, or the addition of chelators or specific blocking agents. If the channels of interest are expected to be cation-selective (or, in some cases, non-selective) large non-permeant molecules such as 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) could be used instead of chloride. 26Membrane potential is defined as the potential of the inner monolayer minus the potential of the outer monolayer, so that the membrane potential of a live cell is negative. For an insideout patch, a positive command potential (i.e., the potential applied through the amplifier to the command electrode in the patch-pipette) corresponds to a negative membrane potential. In case of the outside-out configuration, when the orientation of the monolayers is reversed (i.e., the inside one faces patchpipette), a positive command potential corresponds to a positive membrane potential of the same amplitude. 27Higher membrane potentials (up to–100 mV for oocytes) on the one hand often result in better signal to noise ratio, but on the other hand may induce the appearance of multiple subconducting states of the channel and always reduce membrane stability. Positive membrane potentials, though they almost never appear in live cells (with an obvious exception of excitable ones), are still of interest as they allow one to characterize a channel’s behavior under asymmetric conditions and may provide information on its gating mechanism and even molecular structure. 28This may be done either by changing the amplifier settings manually before each recording, or by using the software suite programming capabilities. In the latter case, the program will automatically execute several consecutive measurements with different settings (in this case—by changing command potential) and record the data for further analysis. Subsequently, the channel characteristics (such as its conductance) may be extracted from the data file using dedicated or third party software and plotted against membrane potential to produce a current/voltage (I/V)-curve. If the curve goes through zero point (i.e., zero current at zero potential but not zero in the vicinity of 0 mV), the channel is not clearly voltage-gated. Otherwise, the channel requires a certain voltage threshold to open and is, to some degree, voltage-gated. In cases where the I/V-curve is not linear, the channel is considered to be a rectifier, i.e., membrane potential modulates its conductance. 29If the current saturates (does not increase with tension after certain tension value is reached) one may wish to evaluate the channel’s midpoint pressure, the pressure at which a half of the channel population is open, or its threshold tension, the tension at which the very first channel of the population opens. These are distinctive features of a mechanosensitive channel and generally speaking, characterize its tension sensitivity. It should be noted though, that these are statistical values, and several measurements under the same conditions (including membrane patch size) must be carried out in order to obtain an average value and standard deviation. Of course, patches containing more channels produce more reliable values. In our hands, oocytes can survive pressures as high as −160 mmHg with pipettes with BN 4–5, which is enough to reach saturation for MscS [17]. However, the oocyte membrane seems to be more fragile than the membranes of giant E. coli spheroplasts previously used for characterization of MscS [14]. 30As channels may be distributed over the oocyte surface nonuniformly, several patches may be necessary to find them. Usually 3–4 patches per oocyte are enough to make sure that the oocyte is or is not expressing MSCs. Patching 4–5 oocytes from 2 batches isolated from different frogs should give reliable data on a particular channel’s presence and properties. For beginning stages of an investigation, we can also recommend expressing a previously characterized channel (like MscS, see ref. 17) for an introduction to the method and a positive control. Co-expression of the channel of interest with MscS as an internal standard may be also very useful. 31Recorded traces may be later processed using either dedicated software (e.g., Clampfit, Molecular Devices) or a number of third party suites. Typical procedures include data filtering at 0.5–2 kHz, which reduces noise level but may eliminate fast events, and slight baseline correction. After that one may proceed to a statistical analysis of the events in a trace, including single channel current amplitudes, threshold and midpoint pressures, dwell time in open or closed states, and so on. Typically dedicated software suites provide a wide set of tools for initial data analysis. For more specific aims one may be interested in using such software suites as Origin (http://originlab.com), QtiPlot (http://www.qtiplot.ro) or QuB (http://www.qub.buffalo.edu).

See \"Cell volume control in three dimensions: Water movement without solute movement\" on page 373. See \"Perspectives on: The response to osmotic challenges\" on page 371. Introduction Cell viability and metabolism depend on cytoplasmic water and solute content, and organisms have evolved mechanisms to sense changes in cell water content, solute concentrations, cell volume, and/or turgor. This Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge in land plants and describes their special dependence on cellular water status for growth and development. Understanding how plants cope with water limitation may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes (Long and Ort, 2010). The signaling pathways by which plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these pathways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 2012). In addition to the importance of osmotic homeostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the specific context and language of plant stress biology, and describe what is known (and not known) about the molecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to osmotic challenges.The roles of water in plant biology Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more favorable water conditions. The majority of the water extracted from the soil by a plant’s roots travels rapidly up the plant through the vascular system, eventually to be lost via regulated pores in the leaf epidermis called stomata. This vertical movement of water within the plant mediates the root-to-shoot movement of nutrients, hormones, and developmental signals. Importantly, open stomata are also the conduits through which gas is exchanged between the leaf and the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Thus, plants must continuously balance the advantages of efficient photosynthesis and solute transport with the drawbacks of water loss through open stomata; how well they accomplish this task contributes to their water use efficiency, a key factor in drought response (Long and Ort, 2010). At the cellular level, water is critical for maintaining and controlling an important driving force in plant cells called turgor pressure. Much of a plant cell’s water—and therefore most of its volume—is accounted for by the vacuole (a large intracellular organelle found in plants, fungi, and animals). In plants, the vacuole often takes up >80% of the cell volume, and one of its many functions is to maintain turgor via active transport of ions in and out of the vacuolar space (Hedrich, 2012). The plant cell plasma membrane is surrounded by a strong but elastic cell wall comprised of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a gel of pectin, other carbohydrates, and protein. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the protoplast (all portions of the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane) against the cell wall. The amount of turgor pressure in a particular cell is determined by several factors, including the osmotic difference that is generated by vacuolar and cytoplasmic solute accumulation and subsequent water uptake, and the elasticity of the cell wall (see Verslues et al., 2006, for additional explanation). The turgor pressure of a plant cell can be as high as the pressure of a car tire; high turgor pressure is critical to give plants their rigidity and structure, drive cell expansion, mediate the opening and closing of stomata, and allow movements like the closing of a Venus flytrap (Pritchard, 2001).Terminology and concepts in plant osmosensing Strictly defined, the term “osmosensing” refers to the direct perception of the osmolarity of the external or internal environment of a cell. This term is often used by plant researchers, but it is entirely possible that mechanical stimuli caused by change in membrane tension, cell wall damage, or the disruption of plasma membrane–cell wall connections are relevant factors in osmosensing, in addition to or instead of altered extracellular osmolarity per se (see Fig. 1). For the purposes of this Perspective, “osmosensing” is used to include both the direct perception of osmotic imbalance across a membrane as well as the perception of indirect effects of osmotic imbalance on the membrane, cell wall, or membrane–cell wall system. We anticipate that as the molecular mechanism(s) for the perception of osmotic challenge becomes clearer, so will the terms used to describe these processes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Potential osmosensing mechanisms in plant cells. (A) Histidine kinases could be activated by osmotic imbalance across the plasma membrane, initiating a signal transduction pathway similar to the high osmolarity glycerol response 1 pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (B) Ion channels that are opened in response to planar membrane tension or membrane bending could respond to both protoplast swelling or shrinking. The release of ions in response to hypoosmotic swelling would be similar to the MscS/MscL “osmotic release valve” paradigm in Escherichia coli. In addition, the entry of Ca2+ through an opened MS ion channel could have downstream signaling properties. (C) Cell wall integrity-monitoring mechanisms could involve receptor-like kinases with extracellular domains capable of sensing the movement or disruption of cell wall components. The cell wall is presented as a gray box. The plasma membrane is represented as a bilayer of gray lipid molecules.Plant water status is typically described in terms of “water potential,” a measure of the free energy status of water relative to pure water at a reference state. Water potential is derived from the chemical potential of water but is expressed in units of pressure, which makes it particularly useful in plant biology as a unified measure of soil and plant water status. Factors that decrease the free energy of water (such as increased concentration of dissolved solutes or adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces such as soil particles) make the water potential more negative, whereas factors that increase the free energy (such as increased turgor pressure) make the water potential more positive. Additional details of water potential can be found in Boyer and Kramer (1995) and Verslues et al. (2006). The measurement of water potentials allows for simple predictions regarding the direction of water fluxes and changes in turgor (Boyer and Kramer, 1995). Water potentials of 0 to −0.3 megapascals (MPa) are typical of well-watered plants, whereas water potentials of −1.5 to −2.0 MPa represent severe stress and permanent loss of turgor for many plants including most crop species and the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, drought-adapted plants such as those found in deserts can grow at much lower water potentials, and both inter- and intra-species variation are emerging as important tools in understanding plant osmosensing mechanisms and adaptation to dry environments. The term “hyperosmotic stress” is infrequently used in plant biology. This is because water limitation is rarely caused by the presence of high levels of extracellular solutes but is more often created by the unavailability of water (quantified as a decrease in water potential). The downstream effects of water limitation on plants that are commonly assayed include: the accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline, the induction of protective proteins such as dehydrins, the production of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and increased sensitivity to ABA treatment in physiological assays (Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 2013). An illustration of the relevance of distinguishing between hyperosmotic stress and low water availability comes from simple treatments with extracellular solutions. Treating plants with a solution of low molecular weight solutes such as NaCl will plasmolyze cells (a shrinking of the protoplast leading to its separation from the cell wall), whereas soil drying or treatment with large polymers that cannot penetrate the cell wall (such as PEG) will cause cytorrhysis (shrinking of both protoplast and cell wall). These two types of treatment elicit very different downstream responses and may in fact be perceived by different mechanisms. For example, root growth rate is much higher after cytorrhytic than plasmolytic treatments of the same MPa (Verslues et al., 2006). Furthermore, cytorrhysis and plasmolysis can have different effects on plasma membrane–cell wall connections (perhaps analogous to the effects of osmotic stress on focal adhesion complexes in mammalian cells; see below for further discussion), which in turn elicit different downstream signaling events.Conditions under which plants experience osmotic challenges Plants experience water stress when the water content, and therefore the water potential, of the soil decreases. In addition, plants growing in hot dry air can become dehydrated, even when the soil is relatively wet, if water cannot be taken up rapidly enough by the roots to compensate for the water lost through stomata. Many plants regularly lose turgor during the day when the humidity of the environment is low relative to that inside the leaf, and stomates are open to support photosynthesis. They then rehydrate during the night when environmental humidity is high and stomates are closed. In the laboratory, drought/water stress is imposed by withholding water from potted plants or by transferring plants to media with defined water potential (Verslues et al., 2006). Hypoosmotic stress may occur transiently when dry soil is rapidly rewetted, and chronically upon repeated soil flooding. In the laboratory, hypoosmotic stress is typically reproduced by treating isolated cells with solutions of distilled water after equilibration in high levels of NaCl or mannitol. The phenomenon of water soaking, the accumulation of intercellular water during pathogenic invasion, promotes pathogen survival and may impose hypoosmotic stress on surrounding cells (Beattie, 2011). In addition, some stages of plant development necessarily involve osmotic challenges, including the desiccation of seeds and pollen and their subsequent rehydration and resumption of metabolic activity. It is also possible, though not yet demonstrated, that the cell wall weakening associated with cell expansion during normal plant growth may have some of the same effects as hypoosmotic stress.Molecular mechanisms of osmosensing It is not fully known how plants initially sense any of the osmotic challenges described above. Three general models for osmosensing in plant cells are illustrated in Fig. 1. Below, we further describe the molecular mechanisms thought to underlie each of these molecular models and summarize the supporting experimental evidence. (1) Osmotic imbalance across the plasma membrane. In theory, a protein embedded in the plasma membrane could directly sense changes in osmolarity outside the cell, perhaps via an osmotically regulated conformational change in an extracellular domain (Fig. 1 A; Parsegian et al., 1995). However, there is currently little experimental support for this model in any eukaryotic system (interested readers are directed to the accompanying discussion of prokaryotic osmosensors in the Perspective by Wood). Several osmosensors involved in hyperosmotic signaling through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG)1 pathway, including the histidine kinase Synthetic Lethal of N-end rule 1 (SLN1), were originally proposed to function in this manner, but recent data suggest that one or more of the other mechanisms listed below may instead be involved (Saito and Posas, 2012). Plant homologues of SLN1 have been reported to serve as regulators of water stress responses (Tran et al., 2007; Wohlbach et al., 2008). However, other data have raised questions as to whether these kinases could be the main plant osmosensing system, as loss-of-function alleles have limited effects on key phenotypes such as the accumulation of ABA and osmoregulatory solutes (Kumar et al., 2013). Alternatively, a novel calcium channel, REDUCED HYPEROSMOLARITY-INDUCED [Ca2+]i INCREASE (OSCA)1, has recently been reported to be activated by hyperosmolarity and to be genetically required for several stress-related phenotypes (Hou et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014); additional physiological experiments are needed to fully understand the role of OSCA1 and related channels in drought response.(2) Increased plasma membrane tension. It is easy to imagine how hypoosmotic shock leads to increased plasma membrane tension; dehydration may have the same effect in plant cells because the plant plasma membrane and cell wall are physically linked at multiple locations. Upon plasmolysis, most of the protoplast separates from the cell wall, but thin strands of plasma membrane (Hechtian strands) remain connected. As a result, both shrinking and swelling of the protoplast could increase plasma membrane tension. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are capable of sensing membrane tension and responding to it by facilitating the flux of osmolytes across the membrane (Fig. 1 B). Multiple families of MS ion channels have been identified in plant genomes, and numerous MS ion channel activities have been detected in plant membranes (Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). The MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY (MCA) proteins, a family of putative MS ion channels, promote Ca2+ influx in response to hypoosmotic shock and mechanical stimulus in several plant species (Kurusu et al., 2013). Although no defect in the response to hypoosmotic shock or water deficit has been reported in mca mutants, Arabidopsis MCA1 is required for a normal response to cell wall damage and for efficient root growth into a hard agar medium (Hamann, 2012; Kurusu et al., 2013). Members of two other MS ion channel families, the MscS-Like (MSL) channels and the Two-Pore K+ (TPK) channels, function in organelles (see below). An osmosensing function for plasma membrane–localized MSL or TPK channels has yet to be thoroughly investigated.C. Altered cell wall integrity. The cell wall–plasma membrane interface is a critical site for detecting stimuli generated by changing water status. The Hechtian strands described above are reminiscent of focal adhesions of mammalian cells and, like focal adhesions, can be disrupted by treatment with peptides that harbor the amino acid motif RGD (Canut et al., 1998). This has led to the hypothesis that focal adhesion–like complexes may exist in plants and serve to sense alterations in plasma membrane–cell wall attachments caused by dehydration. Although direct orthologues of mammalian proteins such as integrins have not been found in plants, molecular modeling has uncovered an Arabidopsis protein with an integrin-like structure that may play a role in osmoregulation (Knepper et al., 2011). Alternatively, plant osmosensing might bear similarities to cell wall monitoring mechanisms in yeast (Hamann, 2012; Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). An osmosensor could bind directly to cell wall proteins, or mechanical change or cell wall damage could cause the release of specific molecules that are perceived by the osmosensor (Fig. 1 C). More than 600 receptor-like kinases are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and it is thought that some of these have drought signaling functions (Marshall et al., 2012). For example, THESEUS and FERONIA have lectin-like extracellular domains that may monitor cell wall status by binding directly to cell wall–derived carbohydrates or glycoproteins (Cheung and Wu, 2011). Another family of receptor-like kinases implicated in cell wall integrity is the Wall-Associated Kinase family (Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012). Genetic and biochemical studies support a model wherein Wall-Associated Kinases bind pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, and subsequently serve to control cell expansion through an unknown signal transduction pathway.Osmotic imbalance across organelle membranes. Vacuoles and plastids take up a substantial portion of plant cell volume, and the osmotic status of these compartments must be coordinated with that of the cytoplasm. Thus, the plasma membrane–based mechanisms described above are likely to be accompanied by an analogous osmosensing system in vacuolar and organellar membranes. However, little is known about these processes. The disruption of two plastid MSL channels constitutively activates low water potential responses, including ABA production and sensitivity, proline biosynthesis, and solute accumulation (Wilson et al., 2014). Vacuole membrane–localized members of the TPK family were recently shown to be modulated by membrane tension and might serve a similar role (Maathuis, 2011). Thus, although MS channels have traditionally been associated with protection from extracellular hypoosmotic shock, they are also important in coordinating the osmotic status of intracellular compartments and have an as yet undefined connection to physiological mechanisms important to low water potential response.Connecting perception to response: Osmotic stress signaling pathways Downstream osmotic stress signaling pathways have received a great deal more attention than the initial perception of water deficit. Interestingly, stress-responsive solute accumulation in plant cells may share some mechanisms with solute accumulation in bacterial cells (see accompanying Perspective by Wood). Other responses, such as the induction of protective proteins and stress-regulated gene expression, appear to involve plant-specific mechanisms, some of which depend on stress-induced increases in ABA levels (Yoshida et al., 2014). Many studies have characterized the extensive changes in intracellular calcium, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, and posttranslational protein modification (especially phosphorylation) that occur in plants in response to hyperosmolarity, water limitation, and ABA (Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 2013). In addition, the molecular mechanisms of ABA perception are now known in detail (Cutler et al., 2010). Although some of the genes induced or proteins modified in response to water limitation have clear roles in signaling, the synthesis or import of specific solutes and ions, or protection against reactive oxygen species, the functions of many other stress-induced genes are less clear. A great deal of transcriptomic and proteomic data is being generated, but these data can be challenging to interpret because of the difficulty in distinguishing ABA-dependent signaling events from events that are directly related to osmosensing or mechanosensing. For example, several members of the SnRK2 family of plant-specific kinases are key players in ABA signaling and can be activated by exogenous ABA in the absence of osmotic stress. However, other SnRK2s cannot be activated by ABA but can still be rapidly activated by osmotic stress (Boudsocq et al., 2007). How activation of these latter SnRK2s is connected to osmotic stress is not known. Even the key downstream responses—ABA accumulation, the accumulation of protective solutes, and the induction of protective proteins—have not been definitively linked to signaling chains that lead all the way back to the initial perception of water limitation. Many of the mechanisms described above are also likely to be involved in hypoosmotic signaling, but more research is needed to establish the precise nature of the pathway and identify the critical components. Hypoosmotic stress administered to plant cells in suspension cultures elicits a rapid oxidative burst that depends on a phosphorylation cascade involving Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and/or Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase activation (Cazale et al., 1999; Romeis et al., 2001). The pathway is proposed to induce anion efflux, which is the driving force of osmoregulation in guard cells, but the molecular mechanism has not been determined.Summary and outlook Despite our strong motivation to understand plant osmosensing and signaling, plant scientists still have a great deal of work to do. Key goals for future investigation include: (a) determining the molecular identity of the osmosensing apparatus, as detailed here and illustrated in Fig. 1; (b) characterizing the nature of the osmotic stress response signaling pathways upstream of the phytohormone ABA and distinguishing it from responses to other abiotic stresses; and (c) using a wider range of assays in genetic screens to include the full range of phenotypes relevant for plant adaptation to water-limited environments. With regard to conclusively identifying plant osmosensors, the primary limitation at the moment is that no candidate osmosensors have been conclusively linked to stress signaling and key stress phenotypes. This bottleneck can be explained in part by redundancy; something as critical to plant life as monitoring and responding to water status probably involves multiple mechanisms. As described above, testing candidate genes that are homologues of known osmosensors in other systems is a start, but it will also be important to leverage the power of forward molecular genetic screens in Arabidopsis. For this to take place, phenotypic assays that are amenable to high throughput analysis and that either measure the primary stimulus of osmotic challenge or measure downstream responses directly regulated by osmosensors are needed. A promising recent approach taken by several laboratories is to directly screen for altered calcium fluxes in response to osmotic stress (for example, Yuan et al., 2014). Natural variation and genome-wide association analysis also provide new and promising ways to find key genes that may be difficult to discover by classic forward or reverse genetic screens (Verslues et al., 2014). In addition, new tools that would allow one to measure osmolyte movement, ion flux, membrane tension, or turgor in the proper cell biological context and in a noninvasive manner would likely be transformative for the field. Finally, the cytoskeleton is intricately involved in force sensing and controlling cell shape in mammalian cells (see accompanying Perspective by Sachs and Sivaselvan) and is likely to have as-yet-undiscovered roles in the perception and signaling of osmotic stress in plants (in addition to controlling cell wall deposition and other properties). We anticipate that future work on all of these fronts from many laboratories will reveal the ways in which plant osmosensing is similar to osmosensing in other systems, and the ways in which it is unique to plants.

    "abstract": "Abstract The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd  Copyright notice ID: 5047659 PMID: 27510974 Abstract The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex. KEY WORDS: Arabidopsis thaliana, Cytokinin, Plastid, Reactive oxygen species, Retrograde signaling, Shoot apical meristem Summary: During plastid stress-induced apical callus production in Arabidopsis, the cytokinin/WUSCHEL pathway and a plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway are implicated in cell differentiation at the shoot apex.INTRODUCTION The development of land plants provides a unique opportunity to study how cell differentiation is determined, as plant cell identity is highly plastic (Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015). A classic illustration of plant cell pluripotency is the ability to produce a mass of undifferentiated cells referred to as callus. In nature, callus production is triggered by wounding or exposure to pathogens (Ikeuchi et al., 2013). In the laboratory, callus is typically induced by exogenous treatment with two phytohormones, cytokinin (CK) and auxin (Skoog and Miller, 1957). Callus is frequently derived from meristem or meristem-like cells (Jiang et al., 2015; Sugimoto et al., 2011). Meristems are small self-renewing pools of undifferentiated cells from which new organs are derived as the plant grows (Aichinger et al., 2012; Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015). Above ground, the maintenance and regulation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is crucial for the proper specification and positioning of leaves (Barton, 2010). SAM identity requires both the imposition of stem cell fate by the WUSCHEL (WUS)/CLAVATA (CLV) signaling circuit (Fletcher et al., 1999; Schoof et al., 2000) and the suppression of differentiation by SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) (Endrizzi et al., 1996; Long et al., 1996). CK plays a key role in the function of the SAM. In the central zone (CZ), CK promotes proliferation, while auxin promotes differentiation in the peripheral zone (PZ) (Schaller et al., 2015). Localized CK perception and response specifies the organizing center of the SAM, also the region of WUS expression (Chickarmane et al., 2012; Gordon et al., 2009; Zurcher et al., 2013). WUS activity maintains itself through a positive feedback loop involving the CK response via type-A Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs), key negative regulators of CK signaling (Leibfried et al., 2005; Schuster et al., 2014; To et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2010). In the SAM, auxin acts to repress ARR7 and ARR15, (Zhao et al., 2010). Thus, auxin and CK synergize to regulate the core WUS/CLV pathway, maintaining a balance between differentiation and proliferation in the SAM (Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015; Ikeuchi et al., 2013). Shoot development also depends on plastids, which are endosymbiotic organelles responsible for photosynthesis, amino acid, starch and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the production of many hormones and secondary metabolites (Neuhaus and Emes, 2000). As cells leave the SAM and take on the appropriate cell identity within leaf primordia, the small, undifferentiated plastids – called proplastids – inside them must also differentiate, usually into chloroplasts. Many mutants lacking functional plastid-localized proteins exhibit secondary defects in leaf cell specification (Larkin, 2014; Luesse et al., 2015; Moschopoulos et al., 2012), providing genetic evidence that normal leaf development depends upon plastid homeostasis. The integration of plastid differentiation into the process of development probably requires tightly regulated and finely tuned two-way communication between the plastid and the nucleus, including both anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) and retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling. An increasing number of overlapping retrograde signaling pathways that are triggered by developmental or environmental defects in plastid function have been identified (Chan et al., 2016; Woodson and Chory, 2012). Numerous retrograde signals have been proposed, including intermediates in isoprenoid (Xiao et al., 2012) biosynthesis, heme (Woodson et al., 2011), phosphonucleotides (Estavillo et al., 2011), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Wagner et al., 2004) and oxidized carotenoids (Ramel et al., 2012). Despite the diversity, all these pathways and signals link a disruption in plastid homeostasis to altered nuclear gene expression (Chan et al., 2016). One retrograde signaling pathway that may serve to connect plastid signals to shoot development is the GENOMES UNCOUPLED (GUN1)/ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) pathway (Fernandez and Strand, 2008; Leon et al., 2012). ABI4 is a nuclear transcription factor involved in many plant developmental pathways, including the response to ABA, sugar signaling, and mitochondrial retrograde signaling (Leon et al., 2012). GUN1 is a plastid protein of unclear molecular function that is thought to act with ABI4 in at least two retrograde signaling pathways: one that coordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression during development, and one that respond to defects in chlorophyll biosynthesis (Cottage et al., 2010; Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2011). We have been using an Arabidopsis mutant with constitutively osmotically stressed plastids [msl2 msl3 (Veley et al., 2012)] as a model system to address the developmental effects of plastid dysfunction. MSL2 and MSL3 are two members of the MscS-Like (MSL) family of mechanosensitive ion channels that localize to the plastid envelope and are required for normal plastid size, shape and division site selection (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006; Wilson et al., 2011). By analogy to family members in bacteria (Levina et al., 1999) and plants (Hamilton et al., 2015) and based on in vivo experiments (Veley et al., 2012), MSL2 and MSL3 are likely to serve as osmotic ‘safety valves’, allowing plastids to continuously maintain osmotic homeostasis during normal growth and development. In addition, msl2 msl3 mutant plants exhibit small stature, variegated leaf color and ruffled leaf margins. These whole-plant defects can be attributed to plastid osmotic stress, as they are suppressed by environmental and genetic manipulations that increase cytoplasmic osmolarity and draw water out of the plastid (Veley et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014). Here, we report a new and unexpected phenotype associated with msl2 msl3 mutants, and establish the molecular and genetic pathways that underlie it.RESULTS msl2 msl3 double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex When grown on solid medium for over 14 days, msl2 msl3 double mutant plants developed a proliferating mass of undifferentiated cells, or callus, at the apex of the plant (Fig. 1A-D). A single mass at the center of the apex, twin masses associated with the cotyledon petioles or, occasionally, three masses were observed (Fig. 1A-C). New green tissue was frequently observed growing out of the apical callus (white arrow, Fig. 1D). This phenotype was not observed in soil-grown plants. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab msl2 msl3 double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex. (A-D) Bright-field images of 21-day-old msl2 msl3 seedlings grown on solid medium.

(I-L) Close-up images of individual seedlings shown in (G) grown without NaCl (I) or transferred to NaCl plates at 2 (J), 5 (K), or 7 (L) DAG. (M) Bright-field images of 14-day-old msl2 msl3 seedlings harboring the MSL2 transgene (MSL2g) or MSL2 under the control of the SCR promoter. Scale bars: 1 mm (A-E), 5 mm (G,M) and 2.5 mm (I-L).Masses of callus tissue were apparent to the naked eye at the apex of msl2 msl3 seedlings between 14 and 16 days after germination (DAG) and continued to grow in size to 22 DAG (Fig. 1E, second row from top). As previously documented (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006; Jensen and Haswell, 2012; Wilson et al., 2014), msl2 msl3 leaves were small and malformed. To facilitate comparison, the same leaf from each genotype is marked with an asterisk in the time course in Fig. 1E. The percentage of msl2 msl3 seedlings with callus increased to ∼82% by 21 DAG (Fig. 1F); callus was not observed in any wild-type plants at any developmental stage. We previously showed that growth on medium containing increased levels of osmolytes (sugars or salt) suppressed the plastid morphology and leaf development phenotypes of msl2 msl3 mutants, probably by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity and reducing plastid hypo-osmotic stress (Veley et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014). To determine if the same was true for callus formation, and to assess the dependence of suppression on age and developmental stage, seedlings were germinated on MS solid medium and transferred to medium containing 82 mM NaCl at 2, 5, 7, or 9 DAG and assessed at 21 DAG for callus formation and leaf development. Full suppression of callus formation and abnormal leaf development was only observed in seedlings transferred to solid medium containing NaCl from MS at 2 DAG (Fig. 1G-L), establishing a small developmental window after which alleviation of plastid hypo-osmotic stress can no longer suppress leaf morphology defects and apical callus production in msl2 msl3 mutants. Suppression was also observed when seedlings were grown on medium containing sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol, indicating that the effect is osmotic (Fig. S1A). The converse experiment, in which seedlings were transferred from salt-containing medium to normal MS showed that plastid osmotic homoeostasis is continuously required to maintain normal leaf development (Fig. 1G,H and Fig. S1B).MSL2 function is required in the SAM or leaf primordia to prevent callus production To determine if MSL2 expression in the SAM and leaf primordia is required to prevent callus production in the msl2 msl3 background, we examined apical callus production in msl2 msl3 mutant plants expressing MSL2 from the SCARECROW (SCR) promoter, which is expressed in the L1 cell layer of the meristem and leaf primordia (Wysocka-Diller et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 1M, apical callus formation was fully suppressed in T2 msl2 msl3 SCRpMSL2 lines. Although these plants developed multiple sets of developmentally normal true leaves, the majority of T2 lines examined exhibited reduced stature.Cells and plastids at the apex of young msl2 msl3 mutants are morphologically abnormal Closer examination of the apex of young (4-day-old) msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings revealed a cluster of disorganized and heterologously shaped cells at the expected location of the SAM (Fig. 2A). Most cells within the cluster contained large, spherical, clear entities. In comparison, the SAM cells of a wild-type seedling were organized into cell layers and had small vacuoles. We next used transmission electron microscopy to further characterize the morphology of developing chloroplasts and proplastids in the SAM and surrounding tissue of msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings (Fig. 2B). In the msl2 msl3 mutant, young chloroplasts were enlarged, lacked the lens shape of wild-type chloroplasts and exhibited a disorganized developing thylakoid network (Fig. 2B,D and Fig. S2B). In agreement with previous reports (Charuvi et al., 2012), wild-type proplastids appeared as small structures (0.5-1 µm in diameter) containing rudimentary thylakoid networks of varying developmental stages, plastoglobules and double membranes (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2A). However, in the SAM of msl2 msl3 mutants, entities with these established features had decreased stromal density and were greatly enlarged compared with the wild type (asterisks in Fig. 2A and Fig. S2B, Fig. 2F). Many exceeded 5 µm in diameter. All were clearly bound by a double membrane (white arrow, Fig. 2G and Fig. S2C,D). These data show that the greatly enlarged phenotype of non-green plastids of the leaf epidermis (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006; Veley et al., 2012) extends to proplastids of the SAM. Fig. 2.

(B-G) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of msl2 msl3 mutant SAM (B) and developing chloroplasts (C-D) and proplastids (E-F) in wild-type and msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings. (G) Magnified region of msl2 msl3 plastid envelope, indicated by box in F. Examples of proplastids and developing chloroplasts are indicated in msl2 msl3 mutant by asterisks and black arrowheads, respectively. Plastoglobules (PG), double membrane (white arrowheads) and thylakoids (double black arrowheads) are indicated. Scale bars: 50 µm (A), 10 µm (B-D), 1 µm (F) and 100 nm (E,G).Callus produced in msl2 msl3 mutants is associated with an altered cytokinin to auxin ratio and requires CK perception The production of shooty callus has been associated with increased production or availability of CKs and an imbalance in the cytokinin:auxin ratio (Frank et al., 2002, 2000; Lee et al., 2004). Consistent with these observations, apical callus production, dwarfing and leaf phenotypes of the msl2 msl3 double mutant were strongly suppressed when seedlings were grown on medium with the synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (Fig. 3A,C). The leaf epidermis of msl2 msl3 seedlings contain grossly enlarged and round non-green plastids, as visualized with the fluorescent plastid marker RecA-dsRED (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006; Veley et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014). This phenotype was not altered by growth on 2 µM NAA (Fig. 3B), indicating that NAA treatment suppresses callus formation downstream of effects on plastid morphology. In agreement with previous data, growth on medium supplemented with salt fully suppressed the plastid morphology defects (Veley et al., 2012). Trans-zeatin-riboside levels were increased ∼6.5-fold in msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, but IAA levels were not significantly changed (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3.

Scale bars: 1 mm (A,E), 10 µm (B).ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 2 (AHK2) encodes one of three related histidine kinases known to function as CK receptors in Arabidopsis (Ueguchi et al., 2001; Yamada et al., 2001) and an AHK2 loss-of-function mutant, ahk2-2 (Higuchi et al., 2004) is impaired in CK-induced upregulation of WUS (Gordon et al., 2009). Two independently isolated msl2 msl3 ahk2-2 triple mutants showed a significant reduction in apical callus formation, with less than 40% of seedlings developing callus (Fig. 3F). However, the msl2 msl3 ahk2-2 triple mutants were similar to the msl2 msl3 double with respect to the leaf developmental defect (Fig. 3E). Incomplete suppression may be due to redundancy among CK receptors (Gordon et al., 2009), or callus formation and leaf morphology defects may be produced through different pathways. To determine if feedback loops involving WUS, ARR genes (Gordon et al., 2009; Schuster et al., 2014), or the meristem identity gene STM (Scofield et al., 2013) were misregulated in msl2 msl3 seedlings, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine transcript levels in the aerial tissue of 7- and 21-day-old seedlings (Fig. 3G). In msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings WUS transcript levels were upregulated 5.3-fold compared with the wild type by 7 DAG (prior to visible callus development, Fig. 1E); and 4-fold by 21 DAG. STM expression levels were upregulated 2.1-fold in 7-day-old msl2 msl3 mutants, but were not distinguishable from the wild type at 21 DAG. Consistent with previous observations that they inhibit callus formation (Buechel et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2016), ARR7 and ARR15 transcript levels were reduced in both 7- and 21-day-old msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, exhibiting 43-55% and 13-44% decreases, respectively. Transcriptional repression is specific to ARR7 and ARR15, as transcript levels of two other A-type ARR genes, ARR4 and ARR5, were elevated in msl2 msl3 mutant seedlings compared with the wild type. Hypocotyls from msl2 msl3 mutants did not efficiently produce callus in vitro, indicating that an additional signal or signals are required to produce callus outside the SAM in these mutants (Fig. S3A). Furthermore, multiple genes involved in wound-inducible and auxin-inducible callus production show altered expression in msl2 msl3 mutants, including WIND1, WIND3, KPR2, KPR7, TSD1 and TSD2 (Anzola et al., 2010; Frank et al., 2002; Iwase et al., 2011; Krupkova and Schmulling, 2009) (Fig. S3B).Preventing Pro biosynthesis results in a dramatic increase in callus formation and CK levels in the msl2 msl3 background It was not obvious how the constitutive plastid osmotic stress experienced by msl2 msl3 mutants might elicit these effects, but we reasoned that the hyper-accumulation of solutes previously observed in msl2 msl3 mutants, especially the compatible osmolyte Proline (Pro) (Wilson et al., 2014), might be responsible. To test this hypothesis, we crossed the pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1-1 (p5cs1-4) lesion into the msl2 msl3 mutant background. P5CS1 catalyzes the primary step in the inducible production of Pro (Verslues and Sharma, 2010) and stress-induced Pro levels are low in this mutant (Szekely et al., 2008). msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutant seedlings exhibited larger calluses than the msl2 msl3 double mutant, frequently forming multiple calluses (Fig. 1E and Fig. S4A). Callus formation was also observed more frequently at earlier stages of development in msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple compared with msl2 msl3 double mutants (Fig. 4A, light blue bars): at 14 DAG, over 40% of triple mutant seedlings had visible callus, while only 15% of the double msl2 msl3 mutants did (Fig. 4A, light blue bars). Neither the wild type nor p5cs1-4 single mutants produced callus at any time point (Fig. 1E, bottom two rows). A different mutant allele of P5CS1, p5cs1-1 (Szekely et al., 2008), also enhanced callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background (Fig. S4B-C). In addition, msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutants contained seven times more trans-zeatin-riboside than msl2 msl3 mutants (Fig. 3D). Supplementing growth medium with Pro had no effect on callus production in msl2 msl3 double or msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutants at any time point (Fig. 4A), even though msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutant seedlings grown on 20 mM Pro for 21 DAG contained as much Pro as the msl2 msl3 double mutant (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Preventing Pro biosynthesis results in a dramatic increase in callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background.

Scale bars: 1 mm. Quantification of H2O2 content by Amplex Red (D) and O2− production by NBT and formazan (E) in mutant and wild-type seedlings of indicated age.

Statistical grouping in B,D,E was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test, P<0.01. Error bars indicate s.e.m. FW, fresh weight.Thus, it is not the absence of Pro itself that leads to the enhanced callus production in the msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutants. Instead, disrupting the process of Pro biosynthesis could enhance callus formation in the msl2 msl3 mutant background if ROS accumulation were involved, as Pro biosynthesis is a reductive pathway that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis (Szabados and Savoure, 2010). To characterize the levels and localization of ROS in msl2 msl3 double and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutants, 7-, 14- and 21-day-old mutant and wild-type seedlings were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or NitroBlue Tetrazolium (NBT) to detect superoxide (O2−) (Fig. 4C). Both double and triple mutants accumulated high levels of H2O2 and O2− in the SAM region relative to the p5cs1-4 single mutant or the wild type. Precipitate was visible earlier in the msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutant (by 14 DAG compared with 21 DAG in the double msl2 msl3 mutant). Quantification of H2O2 levels using an Amplex Red enzyme assay at these same time points showed consistent accumulation of H2O2 in the double and triple mutants, rising to nearly three times the wild-type level by 21 DAG (Fig. 4D). Levels of formazan, the product of NBT reduction by O2−, increased in msl2 msl3 and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 to more than 2.5 times wild-type levels at 21 DAG (Fig. 4E). Calluses generated by incubating Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 root explants on callus inducing medium also showed strong NBT staining in areas of cell proliferation (Fig. S3C), providing evidence that ROS accumulation may be a general feature of callus tissue (Lee et al., 2004).The accumulation of superoxide in response to plastid hypo-osmotic stress is required for callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background In plastids, the photoreduction of molecular O2 generates O2−, which is then rapidly converted into H2O2 by plastid-localized superoxide dismutase enzymes (Asada, 2006). To determine if plastid osmotic stress and the accumulation of O2− at the apex of msl2 msl3 double and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutants play causative roles in callus formation, plants were germinated on or transferred to solid medium with 82 mM NaCl or with TEMPOL (a O2− scavenger) at 3 or 7 DAG and stained with NBT at 21 DAG. Growth on medium containing NaCl suppressed O2− accumulation in msl2 msl3 double and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 triple mutant seedlings (Fig. 5A), completely prevented callus formation (Fig. 5B) and suppressed defects in non-green plastid morphology (Fig. 5C) and leaf morphology (Fig. 5A). Thus, plastid osmotic stress is responsible for O2− accumulation as well as callus formation in msl2 msl3 and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 mutants. Consistent with Fig. 1H, growth on NaCl suppressed callus formation and ROS accumulation only if supplied prior to 7 DAG. Fig. 5.

(E) Percentage of seedlings from D stained with NBT in three phenotypic categories (n≥20 seedlings). (F) Images of CSD2 overexpression T2 lines. White arrows indicate deformed leaves. Scale bars: 5 mm.Growth on TEMPOL-containing medium successfully prevented the accumulation of O2− in the SAM of msl2 msl3 and msl2 msl3 p5cs1-4 mutants, regardless of seedling age at time of application (Fig. 5A), but did not affect plastid morphology (Fig. 5C) or leaf morphology defects (Fig. 5A). Treating double and triple mutant seedlings with TEMPOL at all developmental stages partially suppressed callus formation (Fig. 5B). Less than 40% of double mutant seedlings exhibited apical calluses when grown in the presence of TEMPOL, compared with >90% when grown on MS without TEMPOL. TEMPOL-mediated callus suppression is thus independent or downstream of the developmental window in which addition of osmotic support must be provided for complete suppression of aerial phenotypes (Fig. 1H and Fig. 5A,B). A complementary genetic approach to suppressing O2− accumulation in the plastid was taken by overexpressing wild-type or miR398-resistant forms of the chloroplast-localized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase CSD2 (Kliebenstein et al., 1998; Sunkar et al., 2006) in the msl2 msl3 mutant background. The percentage of seedlings with visible apical callus at 21 DAG was decreased to 50% or less in six independent T2 lines expressing either wild-type (CSD2, lines 2, 4 and 7) or miR398-resistant (mCSD2, lines 1, 3, 5) CSD2 (Fig. 5D). Approximately 50% of T2 seedlings showed strong O2− accumulation by NBT staining, which was localized to developing callus, compared with 90% of msl2 msl3 seedlings (Fig. 5E). In the CDS2 overexpression lines, 15-30% of seedlings exhibited low levels of O2− accumulation at their shoot apex and did not develop callus; less than 5% of msl2 msl3 seedlings had these characteristics. Overexpression of CSD2 did not suppress abnormal leaf development (white arrows, Fig. 5F).Callus production requires ABA biosynthesis, ABI4 and GUN1 As msl2 msl3 double mutants exhibit increased levels of ABA and upregulation of ABA biosynthesis genes (Wilson et al., 2014), we hypothesized that a pathway involving the hormone ABA and the GUN1 and ABI4 gene products might account for the pleiotropic defects in the msl2 msl3 mutant (Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2013). To determine if ABA biosynthesis was required for callus production, we assessed the effect of introducing the abscisic acid-deficient 2-1 allele (Schwartz et al., 1997) on callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background. Indeed, callus formation and leaf development defects were strongly suppressed in a triple msl2 msl3 aba2-1 mutant, with only ∼20% of seedlings developing callus at the shoot apex by 21 DAG (Fig. 6A,B). Similar suppression of msl2 msl3 aerial defects was observed in four other independently isolated msl2 msl3 aba2-1 triple mutant lines. The msl2 msl3 aba2-1 triple mutant accumulated trans-zeatin-riboside to levels similar to those in the msl2 msl3 double mutant (Fig. 3D), suggesting that ABA and CK promote callus formation through independent pathways.

(G) 21-day-old seedlings of the indicated genotypes stained with DAB or NBT. Scale bars: 1 mm (A,F,G) and 2.5 cm (C-E).To test if GUN1 is involved in the perception of signals generated by plastid osmotic stress, we crossed the gun1-9 (Koussevitzky et al., 2007) allele into the msl2 msl3 mutant background and analyzed the offspring of a single msl2 msl3 gun1-2 (+/−) mutant plant. Of 27 triple msl2 msl3 gun1-9 seedlings identified by PCR genotyping, none formed apical callus when grown on solid medium, whereas 16 of 19 genotyped sibling msl2 msl3 gun1-9 (+/−) seedlings did. In addition, msl2 msl3 gun1-9 triple mutant siblings produced larger, greener and more normally shaped true leaves than their msl2 msl3 and msl2 msl3 gun1-9+/1 siblings (Fig. 6C-E, Fig. S5). In some seedlings, small and chlorotic true leaves developed at the seedling apex (Fig. 6E, Fig. S5). The strong abi4-1 allele (Finkelstein et al., 1998) was introduced into the msl2 msl3 background and msl2 msl3 abi4-1 mutants also exhibited reduced apical callus formation; only ∼26% of msl2 msl3 abi4-1 seedlings from two independently isolated lines developed callus (Fig. 6B,F). Neither leaf developmental defects nor ROS accumulation was suppressed in the msl2 msl3 abi4-1 mutant and msl2 msl3 abi4-1 seedlings stained with DAB or NBT showed a pattern of ROS accumulation similar to the msl2 msl3 double mutant (Fig. 6F,G). These staining patterns were not observed in the wild type or abi4-1 single mutants. These results are consistent with a model wherein ABI4 functions downstream of ROS accumulation, probably in a pathway with GUN1, to induce apical callus formation in response to plastid osmotic stress.DISCUSSION One of the most fundamental decisions a cell can make is whether to proliferate or to differentiate. In the plant SAM, this decision must be spatially and temporally controlled, so that cells remain in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in the central zone of the meristem and then differentiate properly as they are recruited into organs at the PZ. Here, we use the msl2 msl3 mutant as a model system to show that, in the Arabidopsis SAM, proliferation versus differentiation signals are coordinated not only at the tissue and cellular level, but also at the organellar level. We further applied genetic, molecular, biochemical and pharmacological approaches to identify two non-redundant pathways through which plastid osmotic stress may produce apical callus (illustrated in Fig. S6). Plastid osmotic stress results in the production of callus at the plant SAM Plants lacking functional versions of the mechanosensitive ion channel homologs MSL2 and MSL3 robustly produce callus tissue at the apex of the plant when grown on solid medium (Fig. 1). Molecular complementation with MSL2 under the control of the SCARECROW promoter established that MSL2/MSL3 are required only in the L1 layer of the CZ and/or PZ of the SAM to prevent callus formation (Fig. 1M) and that their function is crucial during the first 5 days after germination (Fig. 1G-L). The production of apical callus in the msl2 msl3 mutant is associated with dramatically enlarged and developmentally abnormal plastids, specifically in the SAM (Fig. 2, Fig. S2). Developmentally defective plastids were also observed in the SAM of another apical callus-producing mutant, tumorous shoot development 1 (tsd1) (Frank et al., 2002).Increased proliferation and the production of callus in msl2 msl3 mutants is associated with a disruption in the CK/WUS feedback loop The msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit several previously established hallmarks of increased proliferation at the SAM, including increased levels of CK, upregulation of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL and downregulation of CK signaling inhibitors (Fig. 3D,G), suggesting that plastid osmotic stress activates the CK/WUS feedback loop (Gaillochet et al., 2015; Ikeuchi et al., 2013) (top pathway, Fig. S6). The resulting imbalance in the cytokinin: auxin ratio may underlie callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background, as supplementing seedlings with exogenous auxin robustly suppresses all mutant phenotypes (Fig. 3A,C) without affecting plastid osmotic stress (Fig. 3B). In addition, the CK receptor AHK2 is required for efficient callus formation (Fig. 3E,F). AHK2 is required to maintain WUS expression in the meristem in response to CK treatment in the CK/WUS feedback loop (Gordon et al., 2009). As cytokinin and auxin are involved in the production of all types of callus (Perianez-Rodriguez et al., 2014; Skoog and Miller, 1957), alternative pathways to callus production cannot be ruled out. Several previously identified callus-producing mutants in Arabidopsis and Helianthus also exhibit upregulated CK signaling and defects in meristem identity gene expression, including tsd1 (Frank et al., 2002; Krupkova and Schmulling, 2009), EMB-2 (Chiappetta et al., 2006) and the pasticcino mutants (Faure et al., 1998; Harrar et al., 2003). These data suggest that the CK-induced pathway, the wound-induced pathway and the meristematic identity pathway are interconnected for callus production. Furthermore, the msl2 msl3 double mutant is the only callus-producing mutant identified to date with a primary defect in plastid-localized proteins, adding a novel regulatory aspect to these known pathways, and suggesting that plastid osmotic stress is uniquely able to trigger these pathways. While we favor the model shown in Fig. S6, other interpretations are possible. Also consistent with these data is a model wherein the msl2 msl3 lesions lead to downregulation of TSD1 and/or TSD2, or upregulation of WIND genes, either of which could disrupt the CK/WUS loop.Plastid retrograde signaling is required for increased proliferation and the production of callus Genetic lesions that reduce Pro biosynthesis significantly exacerbated callus production in the msl2 msl3 background – an effect that cannot be attributed to low levels of Pro itself (Fig. 1E, Fig. 4, Fig. S4). Instead, the hyper-accumulation of ROS that results from blocking Pro biosynthesis is required (Fig. 5). Treatment with exogenous ROS scavenger TEMPOL as well as overproduction of CSD2, a chloroplast-localized superoxide-scavenging enzyme, prevented or reduced callus formation. Plastid osmotic stress was required for hyper-accumulation of ROS (Fig. 5A-C). In addition, our analysis of callus formation in higher-order mutants established that ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and the transcription factor ABI4 were required for callus formation and act downstream of ROS (Fig. 6; bottom pathway in Fig. S6). Because we were able to specifically suppress callus production, ROS accumulation and impaired leaf development by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity in the msl2 msl3 background, this phenotype is very unlikely to be due to a loss of specific signaling by MSL2 or MSL3. Multiple genetic links between plastid function and cell differentiation in the shoot have been previously described and are often cited as evidence for retrograde signaling (Inaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010; Lepisto and Rintamaki, 2012; Lundquist et al., 2014). ROS accumulation has been documented in at least one other callus-producing mutant, tsd2/quasimodo2 (Raggi et al., 2015). Whether ROS and/or an ABA/GUN1/ABI4 retrograde signaling pathway are employed to communicate plastid dysfunction to shoot development in any of these other mutants is not known. However, the application of pharmacological inhibitors of plastid development or function was used to demonstrate that leaf adaxial/abaxial patterning is regulated by plastid protein translation in a GUN1-dependent pathway (Tameshige et al., 2013), a pathway that is required to facilitate the switch from leaf cell proliferation to expansion and differentiation (Andriankaja et al., 2012). Taken together with the results reported here, these data support previously proposed models wherein a variety of plastid dysfunctions are communicated to leaf development through similar or overlapping pathways that include GUN1 (Koussevitzky et al., 2007; Leon et al., 2012). ABI4 may function with GUN1 in this retrograde signaling pathway, or the reduction in msl2 msl3 callus production in the abi4-1 mutant background may result from indirect effects on sugar signaling or ABA biosynthesis. We note that only a few of the genetic or pharmacological treatments that suppressed callus formation in the msl2 msl3 mutant also suppressed the leaf developmental defects. Growth on exogenous auxin was the only treatment to completely suppress all of the mutant phenotypes, whereas preventing CK signaling, ABA biosynthesis, ROS accumulation or GUN1 or ABI4 function only partially rescued leaf defects (Fig. 3E, Fig. 5F, Fig. 6). It is possible that these differences are due to genetic redundancy or to limited uptake or transport of TEMPOL. Alternatively, there may be two fundamentally different processes that respond to plastid osmotic stress in the msl2 msl3 mutant: one that functions in the SAM during early development and one that functions later on in the leaves. In support of the latter proposal, subjecting seedlings to mild hyperosmotic stress has been shown to prevent leaf cell proliferation (Skirycz et al., 2011). msl2 msl3 mutants may provide a functional link between the CK/WUS feedback loop and plastid retrograde signaling to control cell differentiation at the plant apex Our working model, illustrated in Fig. S6, is that the production of apical callus in msl2 msl3 mutants operates through two non-redundant pathways: the CK/WUS feedback loop and a retrograde signaling pathway involving ROS, ABA, ABI4 and GUN1. While the data presented here establish that both of these pathways are required for callus formation in the msl2 msl3 background, whether they operate completely independently or are interconnected is not yet clear. Here, we present them as separate pathways; support for this comes from the fact that CK levels remain elevated in the aba2 msl2 msl3 triple mutant (Fig. 3D), indicating that ABA biosynthesis is not upstream of the CK/WUS feedback loop. Furthermore, mutants that solely overproduce plastid ROS (Myouga et al., 2008) upregulate CK signaling (To et al., 2004), or hyper-accumulate Pro (Mattioli et al., 2008) have not been reported to produce apical callus, implying that a combination of these signals is required. We speculate that two-way communication between plastids and cell differentiation is essential to coordinate the developmental and functional state of the plastid with that of the cell within which it resides, and that it therefore necessarily involves multiple pathways. These results add yet another layer of complexity to the many regulatory pathways and feedback loops that govern dynamic cell identity decision-making at the plant shoot apex and provide a foundation for future investigation into the relationship between meristem identity and plastid osmotic homeostasis in the SAM.MATERIALS AND METHODS Arabidopsis thaliana mutants The aba2-1 (CS156), abi4-1 (CS8104), p5cs1-4 (SALK_063517), p5cs1-1 (SALK_058000), ahk2-2 (SALK_052531), gun1-9, and msl2-3 alleles are in the Columbia-0 background. The msl3-1 allele is in the Wassilewskija background (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006). Derived cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence genotyping (Neff et al., 1998) of the gun1-9 allele was performed using oligos CGAACGACGAAAGATTGTGAGGAGGGTCT and CCTGCAAGCATTCAGAATCGCTGAAAAAGG, and digesting with PstI. The abi4-1 allele was genotyped with oligos TCAATCCGATTCCACCACCGAC and CCACTTCCTCCTTGTTCCTGC, and digesting with NlaI. PCR genotyping of msl, p5cs1 and aba2-1 alleles was performed as previously described (Sharma and Verslues, 2010; Szekely et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2011).Plant growth Plants were grown on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.7; Caisson Labs) with 0.8% (w/v) agar (Caisson Labs). NaCl, L-Pro (Sigma) and TEMPOL (Sigma) were added before autoclaving. For transfer assays, seed was surface-sterilized, sown on nylon mesh strips overlaid on 1× MS or 1× MS+82 mM NaCl and stratified for 2 days at 4°C before growth and transfer as described. All plants were grown at 23°C under a 16 h light regime of 130-160 µmol m−1 s−1. In vitro callus production In vitro callus was produced as previously described (Iwase et al., 2011) using conditions detailed in supplementary Materials and Methods.Microscopy Confocal microscopy of ds-Red-labeled non-green plastids was performed as in (Wilson et al., 2014). Bright-field images were captured with an Olympus DP71 microscope digital camera and processed with DP-BSW software. Apical meristems were ultra-rapidly frozen in a Baltec high-pressure freezer (Bal-Tec HPM010), excluding air with packing buffer (75 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mM sucrose). Samples were freeze-substituted in 2% osmium tetroxide in acetone at −85°C for 5 days, slowly thawed to 25°C over 16 h and embedded in Spurr’s resin. Sections (1 μm) for phase microscopy were stained for 30 s with 1% Toluidine Blue O in 1% boric acid. Transmission electron microscopy was done on thin sections of tissue fixed for 2 h in 2% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed for 90 min in 2% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead salts.ROS detection and quantification Detection of H2O2 using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) was performed as described (Wu et al., 2012) with the following modifications. Whole seedlings were incubated for 2 h in 1 mg/ml DAB prior to vacuum infiltration, incubated in the dark for an additional 12 h, then cleared with an ethanol series. An Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was used to measure H2O2 production in seedlings. For in vitro localization of O2− with NitroBlue Tetrazolium chloride (NBT; Sigma), whole seedlings were vacuum-infiltrated with 0.1% (w/v) NBT in a 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mM NaN3. After incubation for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, seedlings were cleared with an ethanol series. Quantification of formazan levels was performed as described in Myouga et al. (2008).Subcloning and transgenic lines pENTR-MSL2 (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006) was used in a Gateway technology (Life Technologies) recombination reaction with pSCR:GW (Michniewicz et al., 2015) to create pSCR:MSL2.Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (Wilson et al., 2011). Primers used for gene expression analysis of ACTIN and ARR genes were previously described (Wilson et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010). The following primer pairs were used to amplify WUS (GCGATGCTTATCTGGAACAT and CTTCCAGATGGCACCACTAC) and STM (CAAATGGCCTTACCCTTCG and GCCGTTTCCTCTGGTTTATG). For details of other primers used, see supplementary Materials and Methods.Acknowledgements We thank Kelsey Kropp, Jeffrey Berry and the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center for technical assistance, Lucia Strader for abi4-1 seeds and pSCR:GW, Ramanjulu Sunkar for pBIB-CSD2 and pBIB-mCSD2, and Joanne Chory for gun1-9 seeds.Footnotes Competing interests The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Keywords: synaptic ribbon, ribeye, CtBP2, Shank1a, plasticity, resampling, linear mixed effectsAbstract Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load normally imposed by the Earth’s gravitational field on the inner ear utricular epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as “within-specimen” controls, whereas utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. These data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station. sensory adaptation may be manifested as an alteration in the coding of natural stimuli subsequent to changes in the ambient sensory environment. For inner ear gravity receptors, the utricle and saccule, this environment is dominated by Earth gravity, which is constant over an organism’s lifetime, and chronic alterations in receptor loading are not known to exist. However, alterations in the gravity environment are experienced with spaceflight, and they can be implemented in the laboratory through chronic centrifugation. This raises questions concerning the capabilities of these sensory epithelia for adaptive modifications that may result from exposure to ambient gravitational field alterations, despite the absence of natural conditions in which such alterations may exist. Previous spaceflight studies have demonstrated that hair cells of the mammalian utricle exhibit the capability for synaptic plasticity (Ross 1993, 1994, 2000; Ross and Varelas 2005). In these studies, which were based on analyses of serial transmission electron micrographs, it was reported that microgravity exposures of 9–13 days resulted in synaptic ribbon density increases within utricular hair cells. The greatest changes were found in specimens harvested in-flight (i.e., avoiding the gravity transitions associated with return to Earth gravity). Although increased synapse densities were found in both type I and II hair cells in flight-harvested specimens, analyses were not conducted from multiple loci across the topography of the utricle, and therefore it is not known whether parallel changes occurred in hair cells from different utricular regions. This is particularly important in view of the heterogeneity of response characteristics reflected by afferents projecting from different utricular regions (Goldberg et al. 1990a, 1990b). The significance of Ross’s findings is the demonstration that adult utricular hair cells can undergo synaptic modifications, despite the absence of any obvious conditions in which they would be naturally invoked. As noted above, it has yet to be determined whether hair cells in all regions of the utricle exhibit the capacity for synaptic plasticity. Resolution of this question will be informative of the underlying factors driving the synaptic modifications in view of the differential sensitivity to dynamic linear acceleration stimuli across the utricular topography. For example, afferents projecting from extrastriolar and striolar utricular regions exhibit heterogeneity in their dynamic response characteristics (Eatock and Songer 2011), whereby the low-pass characteristics of extrastriolar afferents enable them to signal steady-state changes in head orientation relative to Earth gravity (Fernández and Goldberg 1976a; Goldberg et al. 1990b). In contrast, steady-state stimuli are less effectively transmitted by striolar afferents (Fernández and Goldberg 1976a; Goldberg et al. 1990a, 1990b) due to pre- and postsynaptic factors that include the expression of delayed rectifier potassium conductances in type I hair cells (Rüsch et al. 1998) and low-voltage-activated potassium conductances in afferent calyces (Lysakowski et al. 2011; Meredith and Rennie 2015). Consequently, a finding of structural plasticity confined to the extrastriola would be consistent with the preferential sensitivity to steady-state stimuli within this region and a reflection of potential afferent response modifications in the new gravitational environment. On the other hand, plasticity found in all regions of the utricle could also result from a variety of uncontrolled variables associated with the spaceflight environment that are not specifically related to gravity (e.g., radiation). In this report, we present our findings of synapse quantification from the utricles of mice that constituted a portion of the biological payload aboard the space shuttle Discovery on STS-131, which launched on April 5, 2010, and landed on April 20, 2010. We analyzed these specimens for structural synaptic plasticity by using immunohistochemical methods to identify closely apposed immunofluorescent puncta representing presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic receptor complexes. These specimens were compared with those harvested from control mice that were maintained in habitat modules identical to those housing animals on the shuttle middeck, and for identical periods. Our goal was to produce a broad perspective of the utricle’s capabilities for synaptic plasticity through a topography-based sampling strategy. METHODS This study was conducted as part of the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) organized and managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The program comprised eight individual experiments with scientific objectives that ranged from biochemical and ultrastructural analyses of salivary glands to vasomotor experiments evaluating vascular dynamics in major arteries supplying load-bearing muscles (Bailey et al. 2014; Behnke et al. 2013; Blaber et al. 2013; Mednieks et al. 2014; Stabley et al. 2012). Therefore, it is important to note that the conditions of specimen harvest and processing were constrained to those that optimized a broad range of mission scientific objectives. This impacted the present study in the progress of specimens through the harvesting procedures and the selection of a postsynaptic marker, which will be discussed below. Animals and Microgravity Exposure Flight (referred to hereafter as “microgravity”) and control animals were 16-wk-old (at time of landing) female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories). For this study we report on inner ear specimens obtained from four animals of each group. Both microgravity and control groups were maintained in NASA Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) for identical periods of time based on the duration of the spaceflight mission. The AEMs were self-contained environmental housing quarters providing ad libitum food and water, sufficient air exchange, temperature and humidity control, and a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. All procedures that affected these animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the NASA/Ames Research Center (Moffett Field, CA). The total mission duration was 15 days 2.8 h, during which time the AEMs remained on the Discovery orbiter middeck. This included the periods of gravity transition at launch (1G to microgravity) and landing (microgravity to 1G), during which time the gravitational exposures are intense and variable. In the present study, animals were exposed to both transition periods in addition to the ~2 wk of microgravity. The AEMs were delivered to the Space Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center ~2 h after landing, at which time the animals underwent a health examination. The first animal was anesthetized ~3 h after landing. Flight animals serially entered the processing queue on ~15-min intervals. The entire cohort of microgravity animals was processed before the control group. Our early efforts to validate the use of pre- and post-synaptic markers included the use of utricle specimens from the Y16 transgenic mouse line, in which yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression is driven by the thy-1 promoter (Feng et al. 2000). In these animals, neuronal subsets, including many vestibular afferent neurons, exhibit YFP fluorescence that proved advantageous in evaluating synaptic markers. YFP-positive specimens were processed in precisely the same fashion as all others in this investigation.Specimen Harvesting The BSP activities followed those of the primary investigation for this mission involving studies of immune responses to an in-flight challenge (Chang et al. 2015). Only non-immunochallenged control animals were used for the BSP investigations. Animals were euthanized immediately after final handling by the immunology investigation team. The time between euthanasia and delivery to the BSP dissection teams was 5.7 min (±1.1 min) for the microgravity group and 4.8 min (±0.5 min) for the control group. The intact central nervous system was first removed for another BSP investigator team, which required an additional 1 min. The temporal bones were then rapidly excised; one labyrinth from each of four animals was utilized for the present study, and fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M Sorensen’s phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was infused into the vestibule through a fenestra made in the temporal bone dorsal to the posterior semicircular canal nerve. The floor of the subarcuate fossa was then debrided to visualize the entire utricle, and the membranous labyrinth was opened to allow the utricle and otolithic membrane to be exposed to fixative. The otolithic membrane was removed by a gentle stream of fixative, and the entire temporal bone was placed in fixative for 3 h. After this period of immersion fixation, each temporal bone was thoroughly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored in a solution of 10% sucrose in PBS for shipment to our University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) laboratories.Immunohistochemical Processing Vestibular epithelia from flight and control temporal bones were dissected and processed intact for immunohistochemical identification of afferent synapses within hair cells and the complementary postsynaptic complex. Information regarding the primary antibodies and the controls used to verify their efficacy is included in Table 1. The protein ribeye is the major structural component of synaptic ribbons (Schmitz et al. 2000) and is made from a splice variant of the gene coding for the transcription factor COOH-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2). Antibodies to CtBP2 were thus used to label synaptic ribbons within utricular hair cells (Braude et al. 2015; Dulon et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2014). Shank1a is a postsynaptic density protein that has been identified in glutamatergic receptor scaffolds, and anti-Shank1a antibodies have been used as a postsynaptic marker in a variety of tissues, including utricle and cochlea (Braude et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2012) as well as retina (Stella et al. 2012). In the mouse utricle, Shank1a colocalized with virtually all PSD95 immunolabeled puncta, whereas no evidence of Shank2 or Shank3 expression was found (Braude et al. 2015). At the time our processing was conducted, direct labeling of AMPA receptor subunits was considerably less reliable, requiring very short fixation times that could not be accommodated in view of the timing constraints imposed by the postflight processing workflow. Therefore, we used anti-Shank1a as a postsynaptic marker because it proved very reliable with standard fixation times that were readily managed in the specimen harvest queue. Table 1.

Intact vestibular epithelia were incubated in blocking solution (0.25% Triton X-100, 1.0% BSA solution in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated 48–72 h at 4°C in a primary antibody cocktail that included anti-CtBP2 (1:250; mouse anti-CtBP2) and anti-Shank1a (1:250; rabbit anti-Shank1a) in blocking solution. At the conclusion of the incubation period in primary antibodies, specimens were washed in 0.1 M PBS (3 times for 10 min). The tissues were then incubated at room temperature in a cocktail of secondary antibodies and stains diluted in blocking solution that included Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500; A-11030; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500; A-11034; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated phalloidin (1:500; A-22284; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissue was mounted on glass slides with one to two spacers (S-24735; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Vectashield HardSet mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; H-1500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A minimal modification was made to accommodate the intrinsic expression of YFP in afferent neuron calyces in studies to validate the use of anti-Shank1a as a postsynaptic marker. For these specimens we used different secondary antibodies to change the Shank1a immunolabeling to the 546-nm excitation line and the CtBP2 immunolabeling to the 633-nm excitation line. The colors depicted in Fig. 3 were selected to maintain consistency with respect to CtBP2 and Shank1a, despite the alterations in actual emission characteristics of the secondary antibodies in these specimens. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cellular localization of CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta. These micrographs illustrate closely apposed CtBP2- (red) and Shank1a-positive (green) puncta and provide evidence of their cellular localization in utricles from thy-1/YFP mice (Feng et al. 2000). YFP-positive afferent calyces aid in illustrating the spatial localization of synapse markers. A: maximum-intensity projection micrograph showing several YFP-positive calyces (grayscale) that encapsulate CtBP2-positive puncta. Additional closely apposed CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta, ostensibly associated with type II hair cells, are readily observed (examples highlighted by white arrowheads). One representative YFP-positive calyx with puncta is isolated (dashed white box) for closer inspection in B and C. B: high-magnification micrograph (single optical section) of the YFP-positive calyx shown in A. Shank1a-positive puncta are observed to be spatially close to the calyx, whereas the CtBP2-positive punctum is within the calyx. The dashed white line drawn through the CtBP2 and Shank1a puncta, as well as the calyx, illustrates the dimension of the fluorescence intensity profile shown in C. C: fluorescence intensity profile from image in B, illustrating the overlapping emission from the Shank1a and YFP, whereas CtBP2 exhibits greater spatial segregation. Fluorescence intensity was obtained from a single optical section with 12-bit intensity range and is expressed in fluorescence units (f.u.) These data further support the notion that Shank1a immunolabeling (green) is closely associated with the postsynaptic calyx (grayscale). D: mean intensity profiles (f.u.) for 12 CtBP2 (red solid line) and Shank1a (green dashed line) puncta pairs. The respective red- and green-shaded regions reflect the standard deviation of fluorescence intensity profiles. For this analysis, fluorescence intensity profiles from 6 synapses each from 2 image stacks were measured and aligned on the peak CtBP2 intensity.Antibody Specificity Processing controls were conducted in parallel with positive immunostaining experiments to assess nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies and background fluorescence. These were conducted in both cryosections and whole mount specimens, representative results for which are shown in Fig. 1. The cryosections were obtained at 14 µm from an untreated C57Bl/6 utricle after immediate posteuthanasia fixation (as described above) and immersion in 30% sucrose (in PBS) for 12 h. These data are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In view of the unique factors required of the BSP processing queue that included a delay of several minutes between euthanasia and specimen fixation, immunostaining controls from additional untreated C57Bl/6 mice were conducted that mimicked this delay. The whole mount control shown in Fig. 1, C and D, represents a utricle from one of these delayed-fixation controls to illustrate the most realistic case for evaluating immunolabeling and background in the experimental specimens. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Verification of antibodies to CtBP2 and Shank1a. A and B: serial 14-µm cryosections were obtained from a postnatal day 71 (P71) mouse utricle, and maximum-intensity projections are shown. Hair cell (hc) and support cell (sc) nuclei are illuminated by the DAPI stain (blue). Numerous closely associated CtBP2-and Shank1a-positive puncta can be observed in the positive immunostained section represented in A (block arrowheads). The CtBP2-positive puncta highlighted by the flared arrowhead in A may represent an undocked synaptic ribbon. No primary antibodies were included in the processing represented in the micrograph in B. The scale bar in B represents 5 µm and also applies to A. C and D: maximum-intensity projection micrographs from right and left whole mount utricles from a P65 mouse. Importantly, fixative administration into the temporal bones yielding the specimens represented in C and D was delayed 7 min to replicate the conditions associated with specimens derived from the microgravity and control specimens. The positive-immunostained specimen of the pair is shown in C, where numerous closely associated CtBP2-positive and Shank1a-positive puncta can be observed. Though faint, CtBP2-immunostained nuclei are highlighted by the flared arrowheads. The micrograph in D illustrates the results of withholding primary antibodies from the processing. Immunolabeled puncta are not observed. The scale bar in D represents 5 µm and also applies to C.The characteristics of positive immunolabeling are represented in the micrographs shown in Fig. 1, A and C. Nonnuclear anti-CtBP2 immunolabeling with the antibody used in the present study was localized to the basolateral regions in utricular hair cells (Braude et al. 2015; Sadeghi et al. 2014), and our immunolabeling is consistent with these findings (Fig. 1A). As expected for an antibody that also recognizes a transcription factor, the anti-CtBP2 also labeled hair cell and support cell nuclei in addition to the puncta consistent with immunolabeled synaptic ribbons (Fig. 1, A and C) (Schmitz et al. 2000). A previous investigation showed that the Shank1a antibody used in the present investigation failed to exhibit immunolabeling in utricular epithelia from Shank1 null mice (Braude et al. 2015), demonstrating the specificity of this antibody for the designated epitope. The secondary-only controls for all antibodies were processed alongside positive immunostaining and illustrate the very low background fluorescence in these specimens (Fig. 1, B and D), even in the fixation-delayed specimens (Fig. 1D). These micrographs also illustrate the universal result of absent anomalous immunoreactivity in specimens processed without the addition of primary antibody (Fig. 1, B and D).Confocal Imaging and Synapse Quantification Confocal images were captured on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope implemented on an upright Axioplan 2 microscope with the use of Zeiss LSM 510 software. The 488-nm (15% intensity), 543-nm (80–100% intensity), and 633-nm (10–20% intensity) laser lines were used for excitation. Bandpass filters (standard filter set of the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta) of 505–530 and 560–615 nm and a long-pass filter of 650 nm were used to capture separate emission channels. A Zeiss Plan-Neofluar ×10/0.3-NA objective was used to capture low-magnification images, and high-magnification images were obtained using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4-NA oil-immersion objective. In this image acquisition configuration, the pinhole sizes were 50, 56, and 65 µm for the 488-, 546-, and 633-nm excitation lines, respectively. The optical section thickness was 0.37 µm. The overall x-y scan size was 1,000 × 1,000 pixels, whereas the total stack depth depended on factors such as epithelial region and the degree to which the specimen laid flat on the microscope slide. A sufficient number of optical sections were collected to image from the epithelial surface through the support cell layer. Maximum-intensity projection micrographs from selected confocal stacks were prepared for publication using Volocity software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used to compile micrographs. Images were systematically acquired for each utricle to sample two regions (90 µm × 90 µm) from the medial extrastriola, three regions from the striola, and one region from the horizontal crista planum (Fig. 2). Manual synapse counting was made more manageable by parsing each acquired image stack into three smaller substacks, each with a two-dimensional (2-D) optical section surface area of 900 μm2 (30 μm × 30 μm), using Volocity image analysis software. These smaller volumes were easily analyzed within one 2- to 3-h block without risking fatigue and concomitant errors on the part of the observers. At the same time, this strategy of quantifying multiple substacks strengthened the data set by subjecting a substantial fraction of the original image stack for analysis. The cropped image stacks were used for all analyses without further filtering. Image acquisition strategies and sampling were performed for different regions of the utricle and the horizontal cristae by using the following approaches. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Topography-based confocal imaging of mouse vestibular epithelia. The locations of image stacks acquired from utricles and horizontal cristae are illustrated by the photobleached areas in specimens labeled with fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin. These appear as areas of diminished fluorescence after image stack acquisition. The white boxes represent the area of the 30-µm × 30-µm substack that was extracted from the larger image stack for the purpose of synapse counting. A: 5 regions of the mouse utricle were imaged for quantitative synapse analysis. These regions correspond to the utricular topography as follows: me1 and me2, medial extrastriola; caudal, caudal striola; middle, middle striola; and rostral, rostral striola. B: the planum of the horizontal crista (indicated by the absence of cruciate eminence featured in the superior and posterior cristae) was imaged for synapse quantification, illustrated by the postimaging photobleached area shown, and served as within-specimen control epithelium that is gravity insensitive.Utricle medial extrastriola. From the two raw image stacks, substacks used for quantification were selected as random, nonoverlapping regions. These cropped substacks, three from each of the larger raw image stacks (for a total of 6 substacks), were used for synapse and hair cell quantification for this topographical region of each utricle.Utricle striola. Three raw image stacks were acquired representing the rostral, middle, and caudal portions of the striola. Image analyses were performed on nonoverlapping substacks that were cropped medial to the line of polarity reversal (LPR). A total of nine cropped regions (3 regions each from the rostral, middle, and caudal image stacks) were used for synapse and hair cell quantification.Horizontal crista. One image stack was obtained from the apical portion of the planar expansion (i.e., the planum semilunatum) of each horizontal crista. Image analyses were performed on nonoverlapping image stacks that were cropped from the apical-most region of the mounted crista. Three cropped image stacks were used to count synapses and hair cells for each crista. Two observers, blinded to any identifying characteristic of each image stack (i.e., epithelial region and gravity condition), counted synapses and hair cells. Synapses were identified and marked within the epithelia volume that ranged in depth from the top of type II hair cell nuclei to the support cell nuclei. We defined a synapse for quantification as close apposition of both pre- and postsynaptic markers (CtBP2 and Shank1a, respectively; Figs. 3–6). The number of hair cells was quantified by the phalloidin-stained apical surface of the sensory epithelium. Hair cells were identified by phalloidin-stained stereocilia at the epithelial surface, which collectively represented “counting units.” We followed a well-established stereological convention to accommodate “partial” counting units (Gundersen 1977; Mayhew 1996). This convention specifies that a counting frame be implemented whose edges define the area within which objects of interest are counted. In our case this frame is established by the square area of confocal scanning. Two adjacent edges are “forbidden,” and counting units (e.g., phalloidin-stained stereocilia bundles) transected by these edges are not counted, whereas those transected by the opposite edges are counted. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Synapse distribution in confocal stacks from control and microgravity horizontal cristae. A and B: maximum-intensity projection micrographs representing optical sections from planar region confocal stacks in immunolabeled control (A) and microgravity (B) horizontal cristae. Synapses defined as closely apposed CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta are observed throughout the micrographs, without apparent differences in synapse densities in control and microgravity specimens. C: the synapse densities in control and microgravity horizontal cristae were found to be similar, as illustrated in the box-and-whisker plots. D: hair cell densities were also found to be similar in control and microgravity specimens.Statistical Analyses We implemented a linear mixed-effects model in the R statistical computing environment (Bates et al. 2015; R Development Core Team 2012) to evaluate the fixed factor of gravitational status (i.e., control or microgravity) on two measures of synapse densities: closely apposed puncta per 100 µm2 epithelial surface area and closely apposed puncta per hair cell. We also conducted parallel analyses on hair cell densities (hair cells per 100-µm2 epithelial surface area). This model was applied to synapse density measures from the medial extrastriola, striola, and horizontal crista. The model included factors for which measures were not independent (i.e., so-called random effects; analyzing fixed and random effects together represents a mixed model), which included analyses from the three substacks from the same larger region, regions of epithelia (e.g., utricle and horizontal crista) from the same specimen, and analyses conducted by the two observers on the same image stacks. The linear mixed-effects model accounts for the nonindependent measures (i.e., it effectively applies a repeated-measures design). A bootstrap resampling design was implemented to test hypotheses stipulating that the measures of synapse densities and hair cell densities in microgravity-exposed specimens were similar to the Earth-gravity control specimens. This enabled generation of F-statistic distributions that were based on random resampling of the data collected from these experiments and computation of explicit probabilities that the F statistics resulting from the empirical data distributions could have resulted from random sampling from all of the density measures. For analyses of the medial extrastriola and horizontal crista, hypothesis testing was restricted to a single fixed-effect factor, gravitational status, that included only two levels (control and microgravity). Therefore, multiple comparison tests were not necessary to determine statistical similarities beyond analyses of the F statistic. For each comparison, the empirical and critical value F statistics are provided, the latter designated at the probability p (Fc,p). In all but one case, explicit probabilities were determined from the distribution of F statistics resulting from ANOVA calculations following bootstrap resampling of 100,000 resampling trials. Implementation of the linear mixed model for all striolar data included region (i.e., rostral, middle, and caudal; see Fig. 2A) as a fixed effect as well as a random effect (to account for nonindependent measures stemming from 3 regions taken from each specimen). The striolar regions represented spatially different areas of the utricle, and therefore it was deemed prudent to evaluate synapse and hair cell density measures from each region rather than pooling over this factor. In addition, the caudal region of striolae from our mouse utricles was most similar to the region analyzed in the previous ultrastructural analyses from the posterior rat utricle (Ross 2000). Therefore, more direct comparisons were derived by maintaining spatial identity of striolar regions analyzed in the present study, and Tukey multiple comparison tests were implemented for the pairwise comparisons. Within the framework of our linear mixed-effects model, Tukey tests were executed through the glht function library in R. In these cases, all degrees of freedom were not available and t statistics (generally associated with Tukey multiple comparisons) could not be computed. Rather, “z” statistics were specified with corresponding P values, which are reported for corresponding statistical results.RESULTS Topographical Sampling The strategy for imaging whole mounted utricles is illustrated in Fig. 2A, representing a control specimen stained with fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin to illuminate the stereocilia at the apical surface of the epithelium. The darkened regions represent the photobleaching that was achieved during confocal imaging of the stereocilia and provided an unambiguous record of the regions imaged for each utricle. The regions labeled me1 and me2 represent the medial extrastriola, whereas the striola regions are labeled caudal, middle, and rostral corresponding to their relative topographic location. Similarly, Fig. 2B exemplifies the image sampling of the horizontal crista planum. It is important to note that whereas the acquired striolar confocal volumes included hair cells lateral to the line of polarity reversal (LPR), substacks created for analysis from these larger volumes only included hair cells medial to the LPR, which was easily located in these specimens by virtue of the phalloidin labeling. Therefore, these analyses encompassed the striola, defined as the utricular region harboring calretinin-positive afferent calyces, which are almost exclusively medial to the LPR (Li et al. 2008; Schweizer et al. 2009).Association of Shank1a with CtBP2 The data in Fig. 3 illustrate the close association between presynaptic CtBP2- and postsynaptic Shank1a-immunolabeled puncta. We utilized vestibular epithelia from the Y16 line of transgenic mice (Feng et al. 2000) to analyze the spatial apposition in greater detail. In these specimens YFP was robustly expressed in afferent neurons projecting to the vestibular epithelia, terminating in several YFP-positive calyces (grayscale) illuminated in Fig. 3A. Prominent among these is the calyx highlighted within the dashed box, within which is a large CtBP2-positive punctum closely apposed to a cluster of Shank1a-positive puncta. This calyx and associated immunolabeled puncta are shown at higher magnification by the single optical section in Fig. 3B, illustrating the relative spatial relationship between immunolabeled puncta and intrinsic calyceal YFP fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity profiles along a line segment (dashed), drawn through the anti-CtBP2 and anti-Shank1a puncta, as well as the YFP-labeled calyx, are plotted in Fig. 3C. The emission profiles of anti-Shank1a (green) and the postsynaptic calyx (gray) exhibit considerable overlap indicative of their colocalization; this finding is consistent with Shank1a being a receptor scaffold protein within the postsynaptic plasma membrane (Braude et al. 2015). The peaks of both the YFP and Shank1a emission profiles were at a greater distance to the CtBP2 emission profile than to one another, consistent with the presynaptic location of CtBP2 within the hair cell. The distance between peak fluorescence of CtBP2- and Shank1a-immunolabeled puncta is ~1 µm. Further analyses of emission profiles exhibited by closely apposed CtBP2 and Shank1a puncta are illustrated in Fig. 3D. Profiles of 13 puncta pairs were obtained from single optical sections of two independent confocal stacks in a manner similar to that demonstrated in Fig. 3, B and C. The intensity profiles of the CtBP2 puncta were aligned, from which the relative distance of each corresponding Shank1a punctum was determined. Figure 3D shows the mean fluorescence emission profile for all 13 puncta pairs (red solid and green dashed lines); the shaded regions represent the standard deviation of the mean emission for each channel along the profile path. These data illustrate that although the example profiles in Fig. 3, B and C, exhibited a peak-to-peak distance of ~1 µm, the distances between mean fluorescence intensity peaks in these examples are much closer at ~0.3 µm. The key conclusion from these data is that the fluorescence emission profiles of Shank1a-positive puncta are consistent with Shank1a being an affirmative marker of the postsynaptic receptor complex in the mammalian utricle. The “close apposition” to CtBP2 exhibits some heterogeneity in distance. Furthermore, it is important to remember that utricular hair cell synaptic ribbon can extend considerably into the cytoplasm, and the CtBP2 signal is thus not expected to be as close to the presynaptic membrane as presynaptic markers are at conventional synapses.Synapse Densities in the Medial Extrastriola Exhibited Spaceflight-Induced Plasticity Analysis of the medial extrastriola was conducted in two larger image volumes as shown in Fig. 2A (e.g., regions labeled me1 and me2). The objective of this sampling paradigm was to increase the area of medial extrastriola neuroepithelium that was analyzed; we had no a priori rationale for testing hypotheses regarding differential synaptic plasticity in specific medial extrastriolar loci (i.e., me1 vs. me2). Therefore, substack identity with respect to its larger original image stack was retained in the final analysis for the sole purpose of accounting for the repeated measures design (i.e., nonindependence of substacks parsed from the same larger image stack, and therefore the data was obtained using identical imaging parameters). The distributions of CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta within individual medial extrastriolar confocal substacks are illustrated in the maximum-intensity projection micrographs from control and microgravity-exposed utricles in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. These micrographs provide a snapshot of labeled synapses imaged in whole mounted specimens, in which they are abundantly seen as closely associated CtBP2 (red)- and Shank1a (green)-immunolabeled puncta. Nuclei of hair cells are also visualized by virtue of positive anti-CtBP2 immunolabeling. The distributions of synapse densities, expressed as count per 100 µm2, are depicted by the box-and-whisker plots in Fig. 4C. As described in methods, our implementation of the linear mixed-effects analytical model stipulated gravity condition as the sole fixed effect factor (2 levels, control and microgravity) and three additional random effects factors to account for measurement nonindependence. These random effects factors were region (measures from 3 substacks from each of 2 regions of medial extrastriola), specimen (2 regions from the same utricle), and observer (observers A and B; although their activities were independent and blinded to stack identity, they analyzed the same confocal stacks). The analysis accounts for the measurement variance due to the nonindependent random effects factors while quantifying the measurement variance due to gravity status (the fixed effect factor). The box-and-whisker plots illustrate synapse density distributions associated with control and microgravity conditions in the two medial extrastriola regions (labeled me1 and me2). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Synapse distribution in confocal stacks from the medial extrastriola in control and microgravity utricles. A and B: maximum-intensity projection micrographs of medial extrastriola confocal stacks from immunolabeled control (A) and microgravity utricles (B). Synapses defined as closely apposed CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta (examples highlighted by white arrowheads) are observed throughout the micrographs. C: box-and-whisker plots representing the distributions of synapse densities (synapse count per 100 µm2, normalized to surface area of confocal stack) in the 2 medial extrastriola regions (i.e., me1 and me2, Fig. 2A), illustrating the decreased synapse densities found in medial extrastriolae from microgravity specimens. D: box-and-whisker plots of hair cell densities in the two medial extrastriolar regions from control and microgravity specimens. These data and associated linear mixed model analyses illustrate the similarity in medial extrastriola hair cell distributions in both conditions, indicating that the differences in synapse densities cannot be explained by microgravity-induced alterations in hair cell density.The outcome of testing the null hypothesis via the linear mixed-effects model ANOVA, stipulating that synapse densities (as synapses per 100 µm2) were similar in measures associated with control and microgravity conditions, is clearly shown in Fig. 4C. This hypothesis was soundly rejected (F = 17.69; Fc,0.0001 = 15.91; P = 0.000032). From this analysis we conclude that synapse densities in medial extrastriola hair cells decreased with a 15-day exposure to microgravity. In comparing the median values across gravity condition, this decrease amounted to 32.6%. Hair cell densities in the mouse utricle and crista exhibit considerable heterogeneity across the topography of the epithelia, and therefore we analyzed this parameter in each substack. This analysis would serve as a control for heterogeneities in hair cell distributions across epithelial region that could contribute to synapse density. The results are illustrated by the box-and-whisker plots in Fig. 4D. We implemented an identical linear mixed-effects analytical model to test the hypothesis that hair cell densities were similar in measures obtained from control and microgravity specimens. The analysis supported this null hypothesis (F = 0.13; Fc,0.05 = 3.83; P = 0.71), which indicated that the decrease in synapse density found in the medial extrastriola from microgravity-exposed utricles could not be explained by concomitant changes in hair cell density.Unchanged Synapse Densities in the Utricular Striola Reflect Topography-Dependent Plasticity To determine whether the spaceflight-induced modifications in synapse density exhibited in the medial extrastriola were manifested generally across the topography of the utricle, we analyzed synapse densities in the three striolar regions from control and microgravity utricles. These regions correspond to caudal, middle, and rostral areas as identified in Fig. 2A. Figure 5, A and B, represents maximum-intensity projections from middle confocal stacks of control (Fig. 5A) and microgravity-exposed (Fig. 5B) utricles. The numerical distributions of synapse density in the three striolar regions are shown in Fig. 5C. Through the bootstrapped linear mixed-effects ANOVA, we tested whether synapse densities were similar in control and microgravity specimens (main gravity condition effect) and across the three striolar regions (main region effect). The analytical design also tested for interaction between the two main effects, which would identify synapse density differences between control and microgravity specimens in only one or two specific regions. The null hypothesis was supported for the main gravity condition effect, demonstrating that synapse densities were similar for control and microgravity conditions (F = 0.035; Fc,0.05 = 3.91; P = 0.85), as well as the interaction between gravity status and striolar region (F = 1.14; Fc,0.05 = 3.25; P = 0.37). However, this analysis did reveal differences in synapse density across striolar regions (main region effect; F = 8.10; Fc,0.001 = 7.76; P = 0.0.00074). Application of the Tukey multiple comparison test indicated that synapse density within the middle striolar region was less than in both the rostral (z = 2.77; zc,0.05 = 2.34; P = 0.016) and caudal regions (z = 2.50; zc,0.05 = 2.34; P = 0.034), whereas densities in rostral and caudal striolar regions were similar (z = 0.21; zc,0.05 = 2.34; P = 0.98). In summary, these data demonstrate that although synapse densities are not homogeneous across striolar regions, spaceflight did not induce further changes in synapse density within the utricular striola. This further indicates that the structural plasticity found in the medial extrastriola of microgravity utricles (Fig. 4) is not homogeneous across the topography of the utricle. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Synapse distribution in striolar regions of control and microgravity utricles. A and B: maximum-intensity projection micrographs representing confocal stacks from middle striolar regions in immunolabeled control (A) and microgravity utricles (B). Closely apposed CtBP2- and Shank1a-positive puncta (examples highlighted by white arrowheads) are observed throughout the micrographs. Synapses are clearly less dense in these striolar micrographs compared with those from medial extrastriola (Fig. 4). C: box-and-whisker plots of synapse densities (synapse count per 100 µm2) in caudal, middle, and rostral (Fig. 2A) striolar regions of control and microgravity specimens. Synapse densities in the striola were similar among all specimens regardless of gravitational condition. D: hair cell densities (hair cell count per 100 µm2) among the 3 striolar regions in control and microgravity specimens are illustrated in box-and-whisker plots. Hair cell densities across gravitational condition were similar.The outcome of hair cell density measurements was similar to that found for synapse density, indicating similarities in hair cell density across gravity condition (F = 0.13; Fc,0.05 = 3.82; P = 0.71) and supporting the interaction of gravity condition and striolar region (F = 0.50; Fc,0.05 = 3.23; P = 0.62). However, hair cell densities across regions were heterogeneous, whereby hair cell density was higher for the caudal striola compared with the rostral (z = 6.10; zc,0.05 = 2.91; P < 0.0001) and middle regions (z = 6.99; zc,0.05 = 2.91; P < 0.0001), whereas densities in the middle and rostral regions were similar (z = 0.91; zc,0.05 = 2.34; P = 0.64).Synapse Quantification in the Horizontal Crista Planum Tests for Gravity Nonspecific Modifications The horizontal cristae from control and microgravity specimens were also analyzed in the present study as “within-subject” controls. We proposed that the changes in synapse density in microgravity-exposed utricular epithelia were induced by the conditions of gravitational unloading concomitant with spaceflight. It was important to consider the alternative that the changes could be induced by alterations in environmental conditions imposed by spaceflight but not specifically associated with the gravitational unloading, such as general systemic stress, radiation exposure, or other unknown factors. If synaptic modifications were induced by factors not specifically associated with alterations in ambient gravity but generally affected labyrinthine sensory epithelia, then a high probability existed that these factors would affect the semicircular canal cristae, as well. Analysis of crista epithelia served as a test of this possibility. The results from analyses of horizontal crista epithelia are shown in Fig. 6, showing CtBP2- and Shank1a-immunolabeled puncta in maximum-intensity projections of representative confocal micrographs (Fig. 6, A and B) and a box-and-whisker plot (Fig. 6C). Similar to the strategy for the utricular regions, we tested the hypothesis that synapse densities in horizontal cristae were similar in control and microgravity-exposed conditions. Using bootstrap linear mixed-effects ANOVA, we found that this hypothesis was supported (F = 0.072; Fc,0.05 = 4.05; P = 0.79), and therefore we conclude that synapse density is unchanged in the horizontal crista after spaceflight. Hair cell densities were also determined in the planar region substacks from control and microgravity horizontal cristae and are plotted in Fig. 6D. Linear mixed model ANOVA analyses revealed that these densities were similar (F = 1.67; Fc,0.05 = 4.11; P = 0.20).Simulations of Random Associations Between Puncta in a Confocal Volume The present study incorporated a strategy of quantifying synapses defined as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta within “volumes” from various topographic regions of utricular and crista epithelia obtained from microgravity and control mice. Furthermore, the data from Fig. 3 illustrate that the inter-punctum distance for such “close apposition” could be as large as 1 µm when analyzed via confocal microscopy. We sought to glean some perspective for these synapse counts by evaluating the probability of random close appositions between pre- and postsynaptic puncta within 1 µm of one another. This was achieved by conducting simulations in which two populations of markers were independently and randomly distributed in a cubic volume measuring 30 µm in height, width, and depth. The resolution of each dimension was 30 nm (i.e., 1,000 points along each dimension), producing a total of 109 possible vertices (i.e., x, y, z coordinate locations) for random spatial distribution. This volume and possible locations were similar to the confocal volumes analyzed in the present investigation. Simulations were conducted for populations numbering 300, 400, and 500 puncta per marker (2 markers per simulation) based on counts of ~300–500 total CtBP2-positive puncta in the confocal stacks analyzed in the present study. For each simulation, counts of closely apposed puncta (i.e., one from each population within 1 µm) were determined. The simulation was repeated 10,000 times for each population quantity, the results of which are shown in Fig. 7. An additional simulation was conducted for puncta populations of 300 per population, for which the distance criterion was reduced to 0.75 µm. All simulation data are expressed as random association counts per 100 µm2 for direct comparison with the empirical synapse data in Figs. 4–6. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Simulations reveal the probability of random associations between 2 “virtual markers” within a volume. Histograms represent the distribution of 2 closely apposed (i.e., ≤1 µm) markers, 1 from each of 2 virtual populations, expressed as count per 100 µm2 and conforming to the analyses reflected in Figs. 4–6. The 2 virtual populations were randomly distributed in a cubic volume with x, y, and z dimensions of 30 µm and a resolution of 30 nm (1,000 points along each dimension). Each histogram reflects the distributions of random association within 1 µm between the 2 marker populations, numbering 300 (green thick dashed line), 400 (red solid line), and 500 (blue dashed line) for each marker. The mean number of random associations is reflected in parentheses within the key, and the count representing 5% probability for each distribution is indicated by the respective vertical arrows. Counts corresponding to the 1% probability for each distribution are 2.56 (n = 300), 4.0 (n = 400), and 5.78 (n = 500). The histogram at the far left (green thin dashed line) represents the distribution of random associations within 0.75 µm to illustrate the decreased probability as the distance criterion decreases. As shown in Fig. 3, many CtBP2 and Shank1a puncta are much closer than 1 µm.Despite 109 possible locations for each marker (i.e., 1,000 possible coordinates along each of 3 axes for a defined volume), these simulations demonstrate that the probability of a random association between members from each marker population (i.e., n = 300, 400, or 500 each, within 1 µm) is larger than might be expected. Consider the simulation in which random associations within 1 µm were counted for two marker populations numbering 300 each (green thick dashed line). This simulation demonstrated a 5% probability (i.e., α = 0.05) of a random association count of 2.2 per 100 µm2 (indicated by the green block arrow along the abscissa). For the populations numbering 400 (red solid line) and 500 (blue dashed line), the random association counts at α = 0.05 were 3.6 (red block arrow) and 5.3 (blue block arrow) associations per 100 µm2, respectively. It is important to note that these associations are purely random and without any spatial specificity, whereas the immunolabeled puncta were certainly not random (i.e., immunolabeled puncta not observed in controls in which primary antibodies were withheld from processing). Furthermore, Fig. 3D illustrates that the distance between many CtBP2 and Shank1a associations was far less than 1 µm. Therefore, an additional simulation was conducted to evaluate the influence of narrowing the distance criterion on the probability of random associations. For this simulation, the distance criterion was narrowed to 0.75 µm, whereupon the probability of random association decreased as illustrated by the histogram at far left in Fig. 7 (green thin dashed line). With narrowing of the distance criterion, the random association count associated with 5% probability was reduced to just over 1 “virtual synapse” per 100 µm2 (green flared arrow, far left along abscissa). Very similar results were obtained when we simulated random distributions in 3-D volumes and measured the nearest distance between points of two distinct distributions. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility of random association between CtBP2- and Shank1a-immunolabeled puncta, the probabilities of occurrence were low.Synaptic Plasticity The analyses presented thus far demonstrate an overall decrease in synapse density within the medial extrastriolae of utricles from microgravity-exposed mice, expressed as synapse count per 100 µm2 of epithelia surface area. These changes were specific to this region of sensory epithelia, since synapse density modifications were not observed in the striolae or horizontal cristae. Because hair cell density is not uniform across all epithelial regions, we also analyzed synapse density normalized to hair cell density to further scrutinize synapse density modifications across sensory epithelia. These data are shown by the box-and-whisker plots in Fig. 8 for the medial extrastriola and striola regions of the utricle and for the horizontal crista planum. Consistent with the previous analyses, the linear mixed-effects model ANOVA revealed that synapse densities expressed as synapses per hair cell were similar in control and microgravity conditions for both the striola (F = 0.036, Fc,0.05 = 3.91; P = 0.85) and horizontal crista (F = 0.54, Fc,0.05 = 4.03; P = 0.48). However, synapse density per hair cell decreased in the medial extrastriola as a result of microgravity exposure (F = 9.02, Fc,0.005 = 7.95; P = 0.0027). This additional analysis supports the conclusion that microgravity-induced synaptic plasticity in medial extrastriola hair cells resulted from the loss of synaptic specializations. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Summary box-and-whisker plots of synapse densities (number of synapses per hair cell) in vestibular epithelia from control and microgravity mice. Synapse density per hair cell was lower in the medial extrastriola in microgravity specimens compared with controls (**P = 0.0027), whereas comparable measures were similar in the 3 striola regions (P = 0.85) and the planar region of the horizontal crista (P = 0.48).In addition to those associated with Shank1a-positive puncta, the total complement of CtBP2-positive puncta also included synaptic ribbons undocked from an active zone, as well as ribbons associated with postsynaptic densities that did not incorporate Shank1a. As indicated above, Braude et al. (2015) found no evidence for postsynaptic densities in the mouse utricular striola that were Shank1a deficient but did not explore other topographic regions. Consequently, we cannot categorically exclude the possibility that some CtBP2-positive puncta were associated with Shank1a-deficient postsynaptic densities. Nonetheless, a comparison of total CtBP2-positive puncta in control and microgravity specimens provided insight regarding whether the change in medial extrastriola synapse density was consistent with a decrease in overall ribbon density in utricular hair cells. This was accomplished by applying the linear mixed-effects analytical model on total CtBP2 puncta densities (puncta per hair cell). These results are shown in Table 2, in which the numerical results from the synapse densities (i.e., CtBP2 and Shank1a associations) are also included. These results ultimately demonstrated that total CtBP2 puncta densities were similar in control and microgravity groups. This finding supports the conclusions that exposure to microgravity does not result in alterations in synaptic ribbon density and that the decrease in synapse density (i.e., paired pre- and postsynaptic markers) was not induced by a decrease in synaptic ribbons in medial extrastriola hair cells. This analysis also provides insight pertinent to reconciliation of the present results with those previously reported by Ross and colleagues (Ross 1993, 1994, 2000; Ross and Varelas 2005). Table 2.

N value reflects the total number of measurements included in the distribution, including those made by 2 “observers” on the same specimens. Specimens included, in general, 3 subregions from each area (2 for medial extrastriola, 3 from striola, and 1 from the horizontal crista) within the topographical regions specified. As discussed in methods, appropriate consideration of nonindependent measures was a critical component of implementation of the linear mixed-effects analytical model.DISCUSSION We found that a 2-wk exposure to microgravity induces a reduction in synaptic density in the medial extrastriola of the utricle. The results of this investigation are systematically summarized in Fig. 9, illustrating how the direct outcomes of the various analyses and controls enabled the exclusion of various alternative factors from contributing to the principal result. Because these factors were determined not to be responsible for the decrease in synapse density in the medial extrastriola, we were able to conclude that the synaptic modifications were induced by alteration in the static load acting on the region of the utricle that normally encodes static linear acceleration stimuli. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Summary of results elucidating the systematic rejection of potential factors that could contribute to the principal finding of decreased synapse density. The exclusion of these factors leads to the principal conclusion that this decrease represents synaptic plasticity induced by alteration in the ambient gravitational environment associated with spaceflight.Of course, the design of this investigation included postflight harvesting of temporal bones and specimens of vestibular epithelia, which followed the transition from microgravity to Earth gravity and included periods of hypergravity. As such, we cannot exclude the possibility that the principal finding was affected by changes affected by the transient gravity environment associated with reentry. Evidence to refute this possibility comes from Ross (2000), who showed that the changes in utricular hair cell synapse density were not markedly different in specimens harvested on flight day 13 and those harvested on postflight day 0 (and postflight day 9, for that matter). The statistical comparisons of this previous study were influenced as much by variability within control specimens (see Comparisons with Ross’s Studies of Spaceflight-Induced Synaptic Plasticity). Modifications in Synapse Density Induced by Alterations in the Ambient Gravity Environment The data and analyses of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that modifications in synapse density were restricted to the utricular medial extrastriola in mice returning from 15 days of spaceflight. This modification amounted to a decrease in synapse density by approximately one-third, whether expressed as synapses per 100 µm2 of epithelium or synapses per hair cell. Comparable changes were not found in extensive sampling of the striolae, nor were they found in the horizontal crista planum. Under normogravic conditions the utricular epithelium functions under the load imposed by the otolithic membrane, which results in hair cell stereocilia displacement during changes in head orientation with respect to the Earth’s gravity vector (e.g., following head tilt). Such changes in head orientation amount to very low frequency, or static, stimuli, and previous investigations of utricular afferent neuron response dynamics have indicated that such low-frequency stimuli modulate the activity of afferent neurons projecting from the extrastriolar regions of the epithelium. Afferents projecting from the striola exhibit phasic (i.e., high pass) dynamic response characteristics (Fernández and Goldberg 1976b; Goldberg et al. 1990a, 1990b) and are sensitive to the transition component of static head tilts; i.e., their discharge adapts relatively quickly and does not signal the static change in head orientation. The microgravity condition associated with spaceflight results in static unloading of the utricular epithelium, which severely attenuates (or eliminates) the ambient acceleration required for static otolithic membrane displacement concomitant with changes in head orientation. The otolithic membrane retains its mass, and therefore head accelerations due to transient and translational movements remain responsible for otolithic membrane displacement and utricular (and saccular) hair cell stimulation (i.e., head acceleration acting on the otolithic membrane mass leading to the displacing force). Therefore, utricular function persists to encode linear transients and translation head movements under microgravity conditions; only the component of utricular function that depends on ambient gravity (i.e., coding of static head orientation) is compromised. The localization of the synaptic modifications to the medial extrastriola, and not the striola, provides support to the contention that they were induced by alterations in the ambient gravity environment and not an unforeseen secondary effect of spaceflight. This indicates that the mechanism driving the modification of synapse density was not general to the utricular epithelium. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that alteration in medial extrastriola synapse density resulted from a secondary effect of spaceflight that was restricted to this specific region of utricular topography. We advocate that the compendium of evidence supports the conclusion that the plasticity was the result of alteration in ambient gravitational loading. It remains to be determined whether this synaptic plasticity was driven by cellular mechanisms intrinsic to the epithelium or whether it required central processing and feedback through efferent vestibular neurons. Our experimental design included analyses of synapse density within the horizontal crista planum as an internal control for factors associated with spaceflight that might induce synaptic changes not directly related to sensory modifications of the utricle. These might include radiation or other environmental stressors (Berger 2008; Lackner 2014; Reitz et al. 2009). We found synapse density to be unchanged in horizontal crista hair cells, indicating that the modifications in the utricular medial extrastriola were unlikely to have been induced by factors that could more generally mitigate synaptic alterations in vestibular epithelia.Synapse Density Decrease Implies a “Use It or Lose It” Plasticity Guideline The unloading of the utricular epithelium in microgravity results in the condition where stereocilia displacements during static changes in head orientation, and the concomitant modulation in hair cell membrane potential, do not occur. This indicates that a fraction of the sensory transduction and signaling cascade, funneled through the presynaptic complexes, does not occur during spaceflight and implies a dramatic reduction in total sensory modulation of the utricular epithelia. The combined evidence, both from the medial extrastriola and from the striola and horizontal crista, suggests that the reduction in synapse density is a result of this diminished total sensory transduction activity and is consistent with a general plasticity guideline where the reduction in sensory activity manifests as a reduction in synapses. This implies that the utricle conforms to a “use it or lose it” plasticity guideline and is consistent with recent findings from an investigation of sensory attenuation in the mammalian cochlea (Liberman et al. 2015). Liberman et al. (2015) demonstrated a reduction in synapse density within cochlear inner hair cells following removal of the tympanic membrane, representing an experimental treatment to reduce the magnitude of acoustic input. There is some evidence that the retina undergoes similar changes following light deprivation (Tian and Copenhagen 2001). Therefore, it appears that the general framework of synaptic changes resulting from diminished sensory activity within mechanosensitive hair cells is consistent and may be generalizable to diverse sensory systems, as well. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility of intrinsic synaptic efficacy changes to the remaining synapses, whereby further alterations in sensory information transmission is mediated through fewer synapses. In the present study a synapse was defined as the close spatial association of CtBP2 and Shank1a immunolabeling. Our analyses provide additional insight into the subcellular changes underlying the microgravity-induced decrease in these paired associations. The CtBP2-positive ribbons quantified as synapses in the present analyses represented those at the active zone, being in close proximity to the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein Shank1a. Of the remaining complement of CtBP2-positive ribbons, one component was those undocked, or perhaps “loosely anchored,” to the presynaptic membrane (Jing et al. 2013). Compromise in the expression of the presynaptic scaffold protein bassoon was shown to increase the incidence of loosely anchored ribbons (Jing et al. 2013), suggesting that modulation of bassoon expression may represent a potential molecular mechanism to uncouple ribbons from the active zone in response to microgravity exposure. Another potential component of total ribbon density was represented by ribbons at an active zone but not associated with Shank1a-positive PSDs. Braude et al. (2015) showed virtually complete colocalization of Shank1a and PSD immunolabeling in the striolae of mouse utricles, indicating that Shank1a is a constituent of all striolar PSDs. This would seemingly argue against the possibility that a CtBP2-positive ribbon may represent a functional synapse in the absence of association with Shank1a immunolabeling. However, colocalization of PSD and Shank1 immunolabeling in medial extrastriolar afferent dendrites has not been examined, and therefore Shank1a immunolabeling may not identify all medial extrastriolar synapses. Therefore, whereas total CtBP2-positive ribbon density remained stable, the microgravity-induced decrease in synapse density may be explained by either an increase in undocked loosely anchored ribbons or a decrease in the relation of ribbons with Shank1a-positive PSDs. A third possibility consistent with the present findings is a microgravity-induced decrease in either Shank1a expression or total PSDs in the afferent dendrite. Further investigation into the composition or modification of vestibular afferent PSDs, particularly as they relate to utricular topography, is required to better understand how this crucial component of afferent neurotransmission may be modified.Comparisons with Ross’ Studies of Spaceflight-Induced Synaptic Plasticity On the surface, the findings of the present study are not consistent with the previous work of Ross and colleagues, who reported microgravity-induced increases in hair cell synaptic ribbon density (Ross 1993, 2000). The contrasting findings may be rooted in key differences in experimental models and methodology, which are listed in Table 3. For this discussion, we focused on the results from Neurolab (Ross 2000), although the salient features are similar to studies conducted during other spaceflight missions (Ross 1994; Ross and Varelas 2005). Table 3.

Table 3 highlights a number of differences in the animal subjects between the present study and those used in previous spaceflight experiments (Ross 2000). Although we do not anticipate major differences in how microgravity-induced utricular hair cell synaptic plasticity is manifested across rodent species, utricles of mice and rats do exhibit remarkable differences in topography (see Desai et al. 2005), which may affect subtle factors that contribute to plasticity (e.g., otolithic membrane loading and/or unloading). The sex and housing factors may have impacted locomotor behaviors during spaceflight, which may have led to a different repertoire of head movements during flight and differential influencing utricular hair cell synaptic plasticity. Perhaps the largest impact may be borne out of the large difference in body mass between mice and rats, influencing not only locomotor behavior but also other physiological systems (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal) during spaceflight, potentially having notable impact on systemic load sensing that may feed back to the vestibular periphery via efferent mechanisms. Despite the potential for the aforementioned (and other) factors to be responsible for the apparent contrasting findings of the present investigation and that of Ross (2000), the most likely basis is harbored in the synaptic structure (counting unit) quantified in each investigation. The present study relied on close association between pre- and postsynaptic markers to identify a synapse, but we also quantified all CtBP2-positive puncta, including those not paired with postsynaptic Shank1a immunolabeling. We found that total CtBP2-positive puncta densities (paired plus unpaired) were similar within both striolar and medial extrastriolar regions of control and microgravity utricles. Although Ross (2000) applied strict criteria to define a synaptic ribbon (i.e., electron-opaque structure surrounded by a halo of vesicles), every ribbon was counted, including those that were completely within the hair cell cytoplasm (i.e., not apposed to the presynaptic membrane). Furthermore, it appears that multiple ribbons in a cluster were counted individually rather than as one synaptic complex. In the present investigation, intracytoplasmic (i.e., “undocked”) CtBP2-positive puncta would have contributed to the total count, but not in the synapse counts. Furthermore, CtBP2 immunolabeling does not enable counting of closely situated, or clustered, ribbons. Quantification of CtBP2-positive puncta over large regions of utricular epithelia provides a much broader perspective than can be achieved through spatially constricted ultrastructural analyses. Therefore, there appears to be a number of experimental differences that could belie the apparent contrasting findings between the present and previous (Ross 2000) studies.What are the Drivers of Utricular Hair Cell Synaptic Plasticity? A compelling question stemming directly from the present results concerns the intra- and/or intercellular signals driving the modifications in synapse density. Two scenarios seem most plausible to account for how changes in utricular loading may lead to alterations in pathways responsible for establishment of afferent synapses. One possibility is that the principal driver of plasticity requires a signal generated through sensory integration within the central nervous system and transmitted centrifugally by vestibular efferent neurons. Of course, the cellular mechanisms through which an efferent signal might drive synaptic modifications within hair cells and afferent neurons are unknown. Efferent projections are primarily cholinergic, acting through nicotinic (Holt et al. 2015; Jordan et al. 2013) and muscarinic receptors (Holt et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2013) on type II hair cells and afferent processes (i.e., calyces, boutons, and dendritic branches (Jordan et al. 2015; Lysakowski and Goldberg 1997; Pujol et al. 2014)). Any efferent-mediated plasticity in type I hair cells would require an indirect mechanism involving the afferent calyx (e.g., altering the postsynaptic receptor complex). Whereas nicotinic receptor activation contributes to a broad array of neurotransmission modulatory effects in the central nervous system, none of these have been shown to be mediated through inner ear-specific α9 or α10 receptors (Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott 2004). Morley et al. (2017) recently showed that vestibular evoked potential thresholds were elevated in α9 and α10 knockout mice, suggesting that chronic deprivation of a predominant form of efferent input to the vestibular epithelia manifest in sensitivity changes that may be similar to diminished synapse density. The second possibility is that the pathways for synaptic modifications are intrinsic to the hair cell. Such a mechanism would likely be “promiscuous” in affecting both type I and II hair cells. Of course, both intrinsic and efferent-mediated mechanisms might be involved, perhaps resulting in aspects of each mechanism segregating to distinct hair cell types. Could an efferent mechanism differentially drive plasticity in different topographic regions? This would seemingly require differential projections of individual efferent neurons to the striola and medial extrastriola. Although we previously found similarities in the densities of cholinergic terminals in these two utricular regions (Sultemeier et al. 2010), we know of no direct evidence in mouse utricle demonstrating topography-dependent projection loci of efferent neurons. Evidence does exist, however, for such an organization in efferent projections to crista neuroepithelia (Purcell and Perachio 1997), supporting the plausibility of this mechanism at the circuit level. It should be noted that although the present study did not distinguish synapse counts by hair cell types, there are type I and II hair cells in all regions of epithelia examined. Therefore, it is unlikely that our findings can be explained, for example, by the lack of plasticity in type I hair cells in the case that the driver is efferent mediated. The difference in the fraction of type II hair cells estimated in the striola and extrastriola (40% and 50%, respectively; Desai et al. 2005) makes it unlikely that synaptic plasticity in the striola went undetected even if plasticity were restricted to type II hair cells.Evidence of Peripheral Vestibular Adaptation in Astronauts The present investigation demonstrates that 15 days of microgravity exposure, which was a typical mission duration of the space shuttle era, is sufficient to induce structural plasticity in utricular hair cell afferent synapses in the mouse and that this change persists in the immediate postlanding hours. However, direct evidence of changes in the peripheral vestibular neuroepithelia of astronauts resulting from microgravity exposures of spaceflight has been inconclusive. In one of the more recent investigations, ocular counterrolling (OCR) was recorded from 7 astronauts at R+0 (within 2–24 h after landing), R+2 days, and R+4 days following space shuttle missions lasting 10–13 days (Clément et al. 2007). OCR represents a direct response of the utricle to tilt-induced (i.e., low frequency) shear of the otolithic membrane and likely represents a test of utricular extrastriola regions. This examination revealed no difference in this subject group in any of the postflight tests compared with preflight studies. However, these investigators acknowledged the lack of sufficient power that hampered previous investigations with similar experimental goals and implemented methods to reduce OCR variability. At the same time, the same cohort of astronauts exhibited differences in the perception of roll tilt during early postflight tests compared with preflight. This does not necessarily conflict with the OCR findings suggesting the absence of spaceflight-induced changes in utricular neuroepithelia in astronauts, only that the OCR changes in this subject cohort may be very small in the context of response variance and subject number. There is recent evidence, however, demonstrating that longer spaceflight exposures incumbent with a 6-mo sojourn aboard the International Space Station do result in diminished vestibular function. Hallgren et al. (2016) have shown that OCR recorded from 25 astronauts/cosmonauts during the immediate postlanding period after each of their missions was attenuated by an average of 30%. Although the periods of microgravity exposure experienced by these subjects were vastly different from that experienced by mice in the present investigation, the outcome was suggestively congruent with the synapse density changes we report here. Although direct causal correlations are premature, the similarities suggest that the microgravity effects are relatively rapid and asymptotic, and do not progress with spaceflight duration.Translational Impact of Vestibular Hair Cell Synaptic Plasticity The principal finding of the present study indicates that mature vestibular hair cells retain capabilities for structural plasticity manifested through modulation of synapse density. Investigations are ongoing that are testing the hypothesis that synapse density increases may result from exposure to centrifugation-induced hypergravity, which would provide the foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms through which these modifications are induced. This research will provide insight and strategies for inner ear rehabilitation through the induction of synapse density increases in conditions of vestibular paresis.GRANTS This work was supported by NASA Grant NNX09AL57G.DISCLOSURES No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS D.R.S. and L.F.H. performed experiments; D.R.S., K.R.C., and L.F.H. analyzed data; D.R.S., F.E.S., and L.F.H. interpreted results of experiments; D.R.S. and L.F.H. prepared figures; D.R.S. and L.F.H. drafted manuscript; D.R.S., F.E.S., and L.F.H. edited and revised manuscript; D.R.S., K.R.C., F.E.S., and L.F.H. approved final version of manuscript; F.E.S. and L.F.H. conceived and designed research.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge the dedicated assistance of a small team of outstanding undergraduates that conducted the image analyses of immunohistochemically labeled utricular and crista epithelia.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: To determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors—as a function of clinorotation speed—using time-lapse microscopy.Background: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).Methods: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients.Results: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (P<0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control (P=0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility.Conclusions: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Intricate multi-scale interactions among cells, tissues, and organs fundamentally govern human health, which has evolved on Earth under a constant gravitational load of 1 g (9.8 m/s2). The biological mechanisms underlying the role of gravity in human health remain poorly understood, but their elucidation is necessary for enabling long-term manned space exploration. Numerous studies, supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other space agencies, have shown deleterious effects of space travel on the human body, such as accelerated bone loss,1,2 muscle tissue degeneration,3 and others.4 Importantly, these observations may have broader implications beyond spaceflight applications to provide a more detailed understanding of diseases on Earth. In particular, the musculoskeletal system has historically been a focal point in space biology research, because of the strikingly adverse changes that occur in astronauts.5 More recently, studies have begun to investigate mesenchymal stem cells for their roles in musculoskeletal lineage determination,6 bone repair,7 and tissue maintenance.8 Although the most relevant environment for performing microgravity research is in space, competition to use space-based facilities, like the International Space Station, is fierce and is further complicated by substantial time and resource investments.9 As a result, lower-cost and logistically simpler alternatives are attractive and include sounding rockets10 and parabolic flights,11 or in-lab devices such as random positioning machines12 and clinorotation devices (clinostats)13 to simulate microgravity. The selection of a specific technique usually depends on accessibility, cost, experimental design, and research question. Clinostats are among the most accessible methods to simulate microgravity, and they allow researchers to study living cells using standard laboratory tissue culture supplies.14 Clinorotation experiments have provided significant insight into the behavior of biological organisms in space. The technique was originally developed to study gravitropism in plant development, and has revealed that gravity serves a key role in statocyte function, which is believed to be directly involved in plant gravisensing and growth patterns.15 In animal and human cells, clinorotation has been used to recreate experiments that would otherwise be challenging to perform in space, such as high-resolution microscopy16 and assessment of stem cell differentiation.17 Cellular changes in microgravity have been associated with disruptions in the cytoskeleton and, consequently, changes in cell morphology and behavior.18,19 Although clinorotation is a standard ground-based tool, previously reported studies on the effects of simulated microgravity in mesenchymal stem cells have yielded conflicting findings (Table 1). For instance, some researchers have shown that microgravity enhances proliferation,17 whereas others have demonstrated inhibition.20 Chondrogenic differentiation has also been found to be either promoted21 or suppressed.22 Similar inconsistencies have also been highlighted in a recent review.23 Some of these observed discrepancies could be due to differences in culture media formulation and cell source, but it is also possible that the choice of clinorotation parameters used for an experiment may substantially influence cell behavior.

A two-dimensional clinostat rotates a sample along the longitudinal axis to produce a time-averaged nullification of the gravity vector. Theoretically speaking, to simulate microgravity effectively, the period of rotation should be shorter than some time constant that governs the rate processes involved in the cellular gravisensing machinery that enable a cell to ‘perceive’ and respond to the changing trajectory of the gravity vector. For conventional clinostats, however, there are also practical considerations that limit the angular frequency of rotation.24 Specifically, rotation speed must be adjusted to balance sedimentation forces, centrifugal and Coriolis effects, and Stokes’ drag. Because of these constraints, the parameters of angular rotation depend on the particular design and implementation of each experimental system. To minimize the effects of these extrinsic stimuli, we recently developed a lab-on-chip clinorotation device (clinochip, Figure 1a) that confines adhered cells within a small region along the axis of rotation, limiting residual accelerations to levels below 10−4 g at different rotation speeds.25 Moreover, the clinochip is amenable to time-lapse microscopy, which enables us to characterize the kinetics of cell spreading, changes in morphology, and migration with minimal disruption to the simulated microgravity environment. In this study, we used this device to investigate how angular frequency affects human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) behavior. On the basis of the concept that there are specific rate processes that govern cellular gravisensing (Figure 1b), we hypothesize that hMSCs would exhibit angular frequency-dependent responses. The results of this work demonstrate that hMSCs can in fact ‘detect’ differences in rotation speed in a manner that causes heterogeneous population shifts toward more rounded morphologies and retraction of cell area. This could have significant implications on our basic understanding of stem cell regulation as well as on strategies that are being used in stem cell-based applications. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Framework of how perceived gravity may bias cellular events under clinorotation. (a) The clinochip system consists of a stationary non-rotated control chip and a rotating clinochip, the speed of which can be controlled. (b) In the rotating cell-fixed frame of reference, the components of force caused by the gravity vector oscillate in a sinusoidal fashion during clinorotation. Lightly shaded blocks illustrate hypothetical time constants required for various intrinsic cellular events to occur. Forces experienced by cells are shaded in darker colors to help clarify the idea that slower clinorotation (upper graph) may fail to nullify gravity biases for some cell events, whereas faster clinorotation (lower graph) could provide greater probability of nullification for any given event.",

    "results": "Results Simulated microgravity affects cell spreading Simulated microgravity had a profound effect on both the extent and kinetics of cell spreading (Figure 2). After the initial 10-min cell attachment and before rotation commenced, all of the groups possessed similar cell areas of ~500 μm2. We found that hMSCs in the non-rotated 0 rpm condition (i.e., standard gravity) markedly increased spreading areas within 1 h after plating, reaching an average of 2000 μm2. Their spreading area increased gradually with time, until they reached an average of 3000 μm2 by 8 h. For clinorotated groups, cell spreading was impeded almost immediately. At 1 h, cells in the 30 rpm group were significantly smaller than control with an average cell area slightly above 1000 μm2; cells at 60 and 75 rpm were both significantly different from 0 and 30 rpm, remaining rounded and small. The effects of clinorotation continued to affect cell spreading over the course of the entire 8 h experiment in a rotation speed-dependent manner. By 8 h, we measured a statistically similar but smaller average area of 2750 μm2 for cells at 30 rpm. In contrast, the 60 rpm group had an average area of 2192 μm2, and the 75 rpm group had the lowest cell area of 1500 μm2, both statistically smaller than 0 and 30 rpm. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spreading areas in simulated microgravity. (a) Time analysis of cell spreading of hMSCs in simulated microgravity at different rotation speeds (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm). Note that increasing the rotation speed resulted in less-spreading area over time. NS Indicates statistically similar average areas (P>0.05). (b) Representative micrographs of hMSCs spreading in a glass substrate coated with FN at different rotation speeds for 8 h (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm). Note that cells at a speed of 30 rpm were more similar to control, whereas cells at 60 and 75 rpm have adopted a more rounded morphology.From a kinetics perspective, the time required for cell spreading areas to reach 2000 μm2 was within 1 h for non-rotating controls, within 4 h for 30 rpm, and within 8 h for 60 rpm. Our experiments did not run long enough to determine whether or not cells would reach this mark for the 75 rpm condition, but based on the observed trends, it appears that cell spreading no longer increases after 7 h. These results indicate that cell spreading is markedly affected by angular frequency and that these effects can be observed as soon as 1 h after clinorotation starts. Finer temporal resolutions and longer durations in future experiments may provide more detailed insight on the time constant of important cellular processes associated with cellular gravisensing. One notable observation we made was that cells within each clinorotation speed were not uniformly spread. As individual cells did not accurately represent the population characteristics, we plotted the group-wise distributions of cell morphologies at various time points (Supplementary Figure 1). The 0 rpm control group adopts a broad distribution of cell areas within the first hour, followed by the 30 and 60 rpm groups. By 8 h, it is clear that the 0, 30, and 60 rpm cell populations encompassed comparable ranges of cell areas. The 75 rpm group, however, exhibited a much more narrow distribution. Likewise, when staining for filamentous actin we found that cells also spanned a range of cell shapes within each group (Supplementary Figure 2). There were no discernable differences in actin organization between cells of similar morphology (elongated or rounded), even when comparing across different clinorotation conditions. This suggests that the observed population differences with angular frequency is caused by disparate effects on individual cells, perhaps by triggering/overcoming some intrinsic signal within cells to reduce cell adhesion, suppress actin stress fiber formation, and consequently induce cell rounding. It is unclear whether simulated microgravity directly affects actin stress fiber assembly to result in cell rounding, or whether cell rounding induced by simulated microgravity is what inhibits stress fiber formation. To quantify these differences in cell shape as a function of clinorotation speed, we computed circularity (circularity=4π*area/perimeter2), as it accommodates more abstract shapes than an aspect ratio calculation. We assigned circularity values above 0.6 to cells that were considered rounded (Figure 3, black), values between 0.3 and 0.6 to semi-elongated cells (Figure 3, hatch) and values below 0.3 to elongated cells (Figure 3, gray). As expected from the previous area measurements, Figure 3 clearly shows that increasing clinorotation speed results in a larger percentage of rounded cells in its population. The number of elongated cells was significantly reduced with increasing clinorotation speed, and no elongated cells were found at 75 rpm. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Human mesenchymal stem cell shape as function of time at different rotation speeds. We analyzed the shapes of hMSCs at different rotation speeds as a function of time for 1, 4, and 8 h; black=rounded cells, line pattern=semi-elongated cells, gray=elongated. Cells were stained with phalloidin (actin, red) and representative micrographs were selected for each morphological configuration. At 0 rpm, cells were rounded at the first hour and were mostly elongated at the end of our time lapse. At 30 rpm, the number of elongated cells was reduced but still present at 4 and 8 h. At 60 rpm, there were no elongated cells at 4 h and there were mostly semi-elongated cells at 8 h. At 75 rpm, the number of rounded cells increases at every time point.Plotting cell circularity against cell area for each clinorotation speed at different time points, we clearly see a temporal increase in area associated with cell elongation in 0 rpm control cells (Supplementary Figure 3). This trend becomes disrupted with exposure to 30 and 60 rpm clinorotation, as cells tended to exhibit a broad range of circularity and area. However, only at 75 rpm the does cell population maintain high circularity and smaller areas across time points (1, 4, and 8 h). Overall, our morphology analysis demonstrates that the cell population at 75 rpm possesses a more consistent morphology (average area, cell distribution, circularity versus area over time) over time. Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation To determine whether there was any loss of viability or if rounded cells were undergoing apoptosis, we exposed cells to 75 rpm and used a live/dead assay after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation (Figure 4b). We found no difference in cell viability or changes in cell number when compared with control; in fact, the majority of cells were alive (>90%). Under light microscopy, we observed no evidence of apoptosis (i.e., membrane blebbing) for the cells that were not viable. This also indicates that our clinochip system can be used effectively without loss of cells due to lifting or cell death for at least 8 h. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation. (a) Cell spreading dynamics were measured for cells after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation at 75 rpm. Four hours after clinorotation was terminated, cell areas were observed to increase by a factor of 1.4–1.8 times. (b) A live/dead stain was used to analyze both cells in the control and cells exposed to clinorotation, and revealed that cell viability was preserved over time. (c) A fluorescence micrograph for live cells (green) and dead cells (red) is provided to demonstrate the data we analyzed, dotted line indicates the axis of rotation. (d) Time-lapse micrographs illustrate a round cell adopting a more elongated morphology during recovery in standard microgravity.We investigated whether clinorotation effects on cell morphology are reversible by performing time-lapse microscopy after exposure to 1, 4, and 8 h of 75 rpm clinorotation. Following cessation of clinorotation, all cells increased their areas and round cells became more elongated, similar to most of the cells in standard gravity controls (Figure 4a). Similar experiments were also repeated for 30 and 60 rpm after 1 and 4 h of clinorotation (Supplementary Figure 4). Simulated microgravity inhibits cell migration by inducing cell rounding For cell migration experiments, cells were seeded in Ibidi chemotaxis chips with a chemical gradient of 100 ng/ml NGF to promote cell migration. Under clinorotation, only a few cells migrated, whereas most cells did not (see Table 2 for cell numbers). Cells that were actively migrating at 75 rpm had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) when compared with control cells (Figure 5). Cells that were not migrating under simulated microgravity exhibited morphological retraction (Figure 5). In other words, cell areas changed from fully spread morphologies to more rounded ones. This phenomenon is in agreement with our observations in cell-spreading experiments, even when the initial conditions were different (10 min for spreading assays versus 12 h for chemotaxis and migration assays). We found that during clinorotation cells retracted their area, but did so independently of rotation speed (‘0 h’ P=0.539, ‘1 h’ P=0.288, ‘2 h’ P=0.963, ‘3 h’ P=0.848, ‘4 h’ P=0.689, between 30 and 75 rpm). After 4 h of clinorotation during chemotaxis, cells at 30 and 75 rpm reached an average area of 2500 μm2, which is a value similar to the spreading experiments for 30 rpm at 8 h (P=0.962 between 30 rpm, P=0.975 between 75 rpm). However, we did not conduct experiments long enough to determine steady state–retracted cell areas. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Analysis of chemotactic migration of human mesenchymal stem cells in simulated microgravity. Cells stimulated by a chemotactic signal (NGF) in microgravity exhibited one of two behaviors: migration or retraction. Under simulated microgravity, most cells retracted (N=17) and only some cells (N=6) actively migrated. Cells that were actively migrating (left), had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) in simulated microgravity to those in non-rotated conditions. Cells that did not migrate retracted their area as a function of time. This behavior was similar at different clinorotation speeds (P=0.698 at 4 h between 30 and 75 rpm). Results indicate that the morphological response to microgravity is stronger than the response to the NGF chemotactic signal. NGF, nerve growth factor.Our results indicate that the cellular response to simulated microgravity is more dominant than chemotactic signals, suggesting the role of migration of hMSCs to tissue repair sites might be suppressed in microgravity. We base this conclusion on our observations of response to NGF at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. However, these results were obtained with only one concentration of NGF and it is possible that different concentrations or other chemotactic molecules can elicit a stronger chemotactic response. For example stromal-derived factor-1, which is known to be a strong homing signal for hMSCs.30 Nevertheless, because the response of adhered cells to clinorotation is retraction of cellular processes, we believe that the behavior will be similar, unless the chemotactic agent can also enhance cell adhesion.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Understanding how angular frequency, or rotation speed, of clinorotation affects cell behavior is a critical aspect of microgravity simulation experiments, so that the role of the changing gravity vector in cellular regulation can be appropriately considered. In this work we show that hMSCs can behave differently depending on clinorotation speed. In particular, although average cell area increased more slowly at 30 rpm compared with non-rotated controls, it continues along an upward trajectory at 8 h and seems to be converging with control values. For higher rotational speeds, cell area increases even more slowly, and appears to reach a plateau by 8 h at 75 rpm. This suggests that changes in cell morphology may approach a limit at an angular frequency that is close to 75 rpm, and almost certainly must exceed 30 rpm. Although these results are relevant to our clinochip configuration, results may vary for other clinostat devices, particularly for those that support cells in suspension. Our results are consistent with other research showing that rotation speed affects animal cells, plants, and bacteria (Escherichia coli). For example, a study on osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells reported that rotations at 10 and 40 rpm did not exhibit reproducible, detectable changes from stationary control cells.31 Only a speed of 50 rpm showed reproducible changes in actin cytoskeleton and cell surface integrin β1 and apoptosis. The same effect has been observed with E. coli,32 which exhibited differential response as a function of clinorotation speeds from 10 to 50 rpm. Interestingly, the difference between 40 and 50 rpm is only 0.1674 of a cycle per second, indicating that cells can be highly sensitive to small changes in angular frequency. Although a precise gravisensing mechanism has yet to be determined, it must be one that can detect subtle alterations to external forces in a short period of time. Our data indicate that it is linked to pathways that are involved in cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization, two phenomena that have been observed for different cell types. Potential candidates could be one or more molecules already known to play important roles in cellular mechanoregulation, such as the Rho family of GTPases,33 ion mechanosensitive channels,34 intracellular calcium,35 nuclear deformations,36 focal adhesions, or other cell surface receptors.37 Although mechanosensitive pathways seem the most direct apparatus for gravisensing, others have also suggested the importance of external environmental factors including fluid shear, fluid and nutrient exchange, oxygen content, buoyancy, and changes in the extracellular matrix.38 Thus, clinostats used to probe candidate gravisensing receptors should minimize external environmental variables that arise from clinostat operation. In the context of a proposed framework for cellular gravisensing, the current results are consistent with our working hypothetical model (Figure 1b). Standard gravity would constitute a constant gravitational stimulus and be detectable to all cells. With intermediate timescales of gravitational nullification, the probability for a single cycle of rotational perturbation to evade gravisensing in each cell would assume a broad distribution. As any putative biochemical gravisensing reaction(s) would be stochastic, the probability for gravisensory evasion in each cell would decrease with both lower angular frequency and exposure to longer duration perturbations. We did in fact observe such trends, as a result of the time lapse, single-cell measurement capabilities of the clinochip system. For our clinochips, we do not expect that centripetal forces have a role with our observed angular frequency-dependence, as residual accelerations were calculated to be on the micro-scale regime. In addition, because the capillary number (indicative of viscous forces) is orders of magnitude smaller than surface tension, fluid shear forces are deemed negligible. There is also no enhanced nutrient transport that accompanies clinorotation in our system. Without these confounding factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cell morphology differences we observed were predominantly due to changes in the angular frequency of clinorotation. We believe the rounding and retracted cell area of hMSCs in simulated microgravity inhibit migration in the presence of a chemical gradient. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell area changes during retraction were different from those during spreading, and were also angular frequency independent, suggesting that distinct gravisensing mechanisms may regulate different processes. Similarly, other cell processes, and even cell fate, could be affected.39 In the same way that microgravity may produce these cellular alterations, other mechanical stimuli and substrate characteristics can also modulate cell function.40 Stem cell morphology has a strong correlation with cellular phenotype and differentiation potential.41,42 It has been demonstrated in prior work that spread cells have a higher tendency to undergo osteogenesis and that cells with rounded morphologies are more susceptible to adipogenesis.42 Because of the short-term nature of this current study, it is not possible to establish whether hMSCs in our system would behave according to these trends. However, our data would suggest that cells at 30 rpm clinorotation would be more amenable to osteogenic differentiation, whereas cells at 75 rpm would tend toward adipogenic or chondrogenic lineages. This may help explain the conflicting reports on mesenchymal stem cells differentiation during clinorotation that we and others23 have observed. Future longer-term studies with the clinochip are required to explore hMSC differentiation potential. Specifically, as we have shown that the population distribution of cell morphologies can be controlled by the angular frequency of rotation, we may be able to derive cellular phenotypes desirable for stem cell renewal, repair, and tissue engineering.",

In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).Methods: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients.Results: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency (P<0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control (P=0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility.Conclusions: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.Introduction Intricate multi-scale interactions among cells, tissues, and organs fundamentally govern human health, which has evolved on Earth under a constant gravitational load of 1 g (9.8 m/s2). The biological mechanisms underlying the role of gravity in human health remain poorly understood, but their elucidation is necessary for enabling long-term manned space exploration. Numerous studies, supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other space agencies, have shown deleterious effects of space travel on the human body, such as accelerated bone loss,1,2 muscle tissue degeneration,3 and others.4 Importantly, these observations may have broader implications beyond spaceflight applications to provide a more detailed understanding of diseases on Earth. In particular, the musculoskeletal system has historically been a focal point in space biology research, because of the strikingly adverse changes that occur in astronauts.5 More recently, studies have begun to investigate mesenchymal stem cells for their roles in musculoskeletal lineage determination,6 bone repair,7 and tissue maintenance.8 Although the most relevant environment for performing microgravity research is in space, competition to use space-based facilities, like the International Space Station, is fierce and is further complicated by substantial time and resource investments.9 As a result, lower-cost and logistically simpler alternatives are attractive and include sounding rockets10 and parabolic flights,11 or in-lab devices such as random positioning machines12 and clinorotation devices (clinostats)13 to simulate microgravity. The selection of a specific technique usually depends on accessibility, cost, experimental design, and research question. Clinostats are among the most accessible methods to simulate microgravity, and they allow researchers to study living cells using standard laboratory tissue culture supplies.14 Clinorotation experiments have provided significant insight into the behavior of biological organisms in space. The technique was originally developed to study gravitropism in plant development, and has revealed that gravity serves a key role in statocyte function, which is believed to be directly involved in plant gravisensing and growth patterns.15 In animal and human cells, clinorotation has been used to recreate experiments that would otherwise be challenging to perform in space, such as high-resolution microscopy16 and assessment of stem cell differentiation.17 Cellular changes in microgravity have been associated with disruptions in the cytoskeleton and, consequently, changes in cell morphology and behavior.18,19 Although clinorotation is a standard ground-based tool, previously reported studies on the effects of simulated microgravity in mesenchymal stem cells have yielded conflicting findings (Table 1). For instance, some researchers have shown that microgravity enhances proliferation,17 whereas others have demonstrated inhibition.20 Chondrogenic differentiation has also been found to be either promoted21 or suppressed.22 Similar inconsistencies have also been highlighted in a recent review.23 Some of these observed discrepancies could be due to differences in culture media formulation and cell source, but it is also possible that the choice of clinorotation parameters used for an experiment may substantially influence cell behavior.

A two-dimensional clinostat rotates a sample along the longitudinal axis to produce a time-averaged nullification of the gravity vector. Theoretically speaking, to simulate microgravity effectively, the period of rotation should be shorter than some time constant that governs the rate processes involved in the cellular gravisensing machinery that enable a cell to ‘perceive’ and respond to the changing trajectory of the gravity vector. For conventional clinostats, however, there are also practical considerations that limit the angular frequency of rotation.24 Specifically, rotation speed must be adjusted to balance sedimentation forces, centrifugal and Coriolis effects, and Stokes’ drag. Because of these constraints, the parameters of angular rotation depend on the particular design and implementation of each experimental system. To minimize the effects of these extrinsic stimuli, we recently developed a lab-on-chip clinorotation device (clinochip, Figure 1a) that confines adhered cells within a small region along the axis of rotation, limiting residual accelerations to levels below 10−4 g at different rotation speeds.25 Moreover, the clinochip is amenable to time-lapse microscopy, which enables us to characterize the kinetics of cell spreading, changes in morphology, and migration with minimal disruption to the simulated microgravity environment. In this study, we used this device to investigate how angular frequency affects human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) behavior. On the basis of the concept that there are specific rate processes that govern cellular gravisensing (Figure 1b), we hypothesize that hMSCs would exhibit angular frequency-dependent responses. The results of this work demonstrate that hMSCs can in fact ‘detect’ differences in rotation speed in a manner that causes heterogeneous population shifts toward more rounded morphologies and retraction of cell area. This could have significant implications on our basic understanding of stem cell regulation as well as on strategies that are being used in stem cell-based applications. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Framework of how perceived gravity may bias cellular events under clinorotation. (a) The clinochip system consists of a stationary non-rotated control chip and a rotating clinochip, the speed of which can be controlled. (b) In the rotating cell-fixed frame of reference, the components of force caused by the gravity vector oscillate in a sinusoidal fashion during clinorotation. Lightly shaded blocks illustrate hypothetical time constants required for various intrinsic cellular events to occur. Forces experienced by cells are shaded in darker colors to help clarify the idea that slower clinorotation (upper graph) may fail to nullify gravity biases for some cell events, whereas faster clinorotation (lower graph) could provide greater probability of nullification for any given event.Materials and methods Materials hMSCs were obtained from a commercial source (PT-2501, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), and confirmed to be mycoplasma-free. Clinochip fabrication required microscope slides (12-544-1, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 0.25- mm-thick polydimethylsiloxane sheets (HT-6240, Rogers Corporation, Rogers, CT, USA). Fluorescence visualization was performed for actin using 5% (w/v) Texas red phalloidin (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and for focal adhesions using 1 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated anti-vinculin (MA1–34629, Life Technologies). Fibronectin (354008, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to enable cell adhesion, and nerve growth factor (NGF; 7S-NGF, Life Technologies) was used for migration experiments. Calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (L-3224, Life Technologies) were used to perform cell viability assays.Experimental setup In general, we used a single experimental system for all of our experiments, as detailed previously.25 In brief, the system consists of a custom microscope-mounted gear system, driven by a computer-controlled stepper motor that rotates a small slide holder.25 This slide holder can accommodate various custom and commercially available lab-on-chip devices. A non-rotating slide holder enables having a static (standard gravity) control condition performed concurrently. The entire system is enclosed in an environmental chamber (Precision Plastics, Beltsville, MD, USA) and installed on an Olympus IX-81 epi-fluorescence microscope (Center Valley, PA, USA).Cell morphology platform A custom ‘clinochip’ device was used for visualizing cell spreading (that is, changes in cell morphology over time), and fabricated according to our previously described protocol.25 This clinochip consists of three layers comprising polydimethylsiloxane sandwiched between two layers of glass. In brief, we used a high-resolution razor cutter (FC8000, Graphtec, Irvine, CA, USA) to trim stock polydimethylsiloxane sheets. The sheet was cut to length and width dimensions of microscope slides and with a single 1-mm wide, 30-mm long channel at the center. A second microscope slide was used as the third layer. Prior to assembly, two 1-mm diameter holes had been made in the top slide using a sandblaster (6500, Airbrasive, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to provide access to the channels. The three layers were energetically bonded using a high-frequency corona treater (BD-20AC, Electrotechnic Products, Chicago, IL, USA). The clinochip was first sterilized for 20 min in a UV chamber. To promote cell attachment, the channel was then treated with 100 μg/ml fibronectin for 1 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before use. Passage 3 (P3) and P4 hMSCs were seeded into clinochip channels and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow for cell attachment, followed by commencement of clinorotation.Cell migration platform Cell migration was analyzed using commercially available Ibidi Chemotaxis slides (μ-Slide Chemotaxis 2D, Ibidi, Munich, Germany). The slides fit perfectly in our clinorotation device and the 2×1 mm dimensions of the chamber are suitable for simulated microgravity, as they constrain cells to a narrow region about the axis of rotation to minimize centrifugal effects. First, a 100 μg/ml fibronectin solution was injected into the viewing chamber and incubated for 1 h, followed by three phosphate-buffered saline washes. Then, P3 and P4 hMSCs were plated and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h of initial seeding time. Our pilot experiments showed that after 12 h the spreading areas of hMSCs reach a plateau so that cell spreading would not confound the cell migration data. As a first step, we chose to study hMSC chemotaxis mediated by NGF, one of several growth factors identified in this active field of research.26 Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to express receptors to neurotrophic factors including NGF,27 and also secrete NGF during tissue repair.28 In these migration experiments, NGF was prepared as a 100 ng/ml solution and injected into the top ports of the chamber. Following manufacturer’s instructions, the same volume was aspirated from the opposite port to create a chemical gradient.Clinorotation and time-lapse imaging Both morphology and chemotaxis platforms were rotated along the axis of the channels in which cells were cultured. Residual accelerations are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional clinostats, even at 75 rpm.25 Before the experiment, we made sure that the channels did not contain any bubbles, to minimize any other external effects such as shear stress and dehydration. During imaging, we constrained our analyses to cells near the axis of rotation, away from the sides of the channel, to avoid potential edge effects. At the appropriate times (10 min after seeding for morphology assays; 12 h after seeding for chemotaxis and migration assays to allow the cells to become fully spread), clinorotation was initiated at 30, 60, or 75 rpm and maintained over the course of 8 h. Clinochips at 0 rpm (non-rotated) were used as a control (standard gravity). During each hour, rotation was paused for a total of 60 s, and a set of bright-field images of the clinochip were acquired at ×200 magnification. At the end of the 8 h period, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescently stained for actin and vinculin. Captured images were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation Cell viability was determined using calcein-AM (green) to indicate intracellular esterase activity for live cells and ethidium homodimer-1 (red) to indicate loss of plasma membrane integrity for dead cells. Calcein (final concentration 4 μM) and ethidium homodimer (final concentration 2 μM) were added to cell culture media that was used to plate hMSCs in fibronectin-treated clinochips. After 10 min of attachment, clinochips were either rotated at 75 rpm or maintained at standard gravity conditions (non-rotated control) and fluorescence micrographs were taken at 1, 4, and 8 h during clinorotation. In addition to the live/dead assays, we acquired light micrographs of cell morphology in standard gravity following exposure to (a) 1 or 4 h of 30 rpm clinorotation, (b) 1 or 4 h of 60 rpm clinorotation, or (c) 1, 4, or 8 h of 75 rpm clinorotation. After termination of the clinorotation treatment, images were acquired in standard gravity every 30 min for 4 h, and then analyzed for cell area and shape factor using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).Statistical analyses Because no prior publications have quantified cell areas during clinorotation, we relied on pilot data for descriptive statistics to make sample size calculations. Assuming a critical significance level of α=0.05, statistical power of 0.9 (β=0.1), and a detectable difference equal to the population s.d., we performed a power analysis to calculate an estimated sample size of n=23, using the method of Sokal and Rohlf.29 To ensure adequate statistical power for cell area measurements, we chose to include at least n=30 for each sample group (Table 2), acquired over several experimental replicates. All data are expressed as mean±s.e.m. Variance did not markedly differ between groups (less than fourfold). Average cell areas among different clinorotation speeds were first log transformed to improve normality. Differences between clinorotation groups were then statistically analyzed using the Welch’s t-test for samples with unequal variance and unequal sample size, with Tukey post hoc tests for multiple pairwise comparisons.

Similarly, we used Welch's t-test with Tukey post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons to analyze differences in cell area between 30 and 75 rpm (at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h) only for cells that were actively retracting (n=28).Results Simulated microgravity affects cell spreading Simulated microgravity had a profound effect on both the extent and kinetics of cell spreading (Figure 2). After the initial 10-min cell attachment and before rotation commenced, all of the groups possessed similar cell areas of ~500 μm2. We found that hMSCs in the non-rotated 0 rpm condition (i.e., standard gravity) markedly increased spreading areas within 1 h after plating, reaching an average of 2000 μm2. Their spreading area increased gradually with time, until they reached an average of 3000 μm2 by 8 h. For clinorotated groups, cell spreading was impeded almost immediately. At 1 h, cells in the 30 rpm group were significantly smaller than control with an average cell area slightly above 1000 μm2; cells at 60 and 75 rpm were both significantly different from 0 and 30 rpm, remaining rounded and small. The effects of clinorotation continued to affect cell spreading over the course of the entire 8 h experiment in a rotation speed-dependent manner. By 8 h, we measured a statistically similar but smaller average area of 2750 μm2 for cells at 30 rpm. In contrast, the 60 rpm group had an average area of 2192 μm2, and the 75 rpm group had the lowest cell area of 1500 μm2, both statistically smaller than 0 and 30 rpm. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spreading areas in simulated microgravity. (a) Time analysis of cell spreading of hMSCs in simulated microgravity at different rotation speeds (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm). Note that increasing the rotation speed resulted in less-spreading area over time. NS Indicates statistically similar average areas (P>0.05). (b) Representative micrographs of hMSCs spreading in a glass substrate coated with FN at different rotation speeds for 8 h (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm). Note that cells at a speed of 30 rpm were more similar to control, whereas cells at 60 and 75 rpm have adopted a more rounded morphology.From a kinetics perspective, the time required for cell spreading areas to reach 2000 μm2 was within 1 h for non-rotating controls, within 4 h for 30 rpm, and within 8 h for 60 rpm. Our experiments did not run long enough to determine whether or not cells would reach this mark for the 75 rpm condition, but based on the observed trends, it appears that cell spreading no longer increases after 7 h. These results indicate that cell spreading is markedly affected by angular frequency and that these effects can be observed as soon as 1 h after clinorotation starts. Finer temporal resolutions and longer durations in future experiments may provide more detailed insight on the time constant of important cellular processes associated with cellular gravisensing. One notable observation we made was that cells within each clinorotation speed were not uniformly spread. As individual cells did not accurately represent the population characteristics, we plotted the group-wise distributions of cell morphologies at various time points (Supplementary Figure 1). The 0 rpm control group adopts a broad distribution of cell areas within the first hour, followed by the 30 and 60 rpm groups. By 8 h, it is clear that the 0, 30, and 60 rpm cell populations encompassed comparable ranges of cell areas. The 75 rpm group, however, exhibited a much more narrow distribution. Likewise, when staining for filamentous actin we found that cells also spanned a range of cell shapes within each group (Supplementary Figure 2). There were no discernable differences in actin organization between cells of similar morphology (elongated or rounded), even when comparing across different clinorotation conditions. This suggests that the observed population differences with angular frequency is caused by disparate effects on individual cells, perhaps by triggering/overcoming some intrinsic signal within cells to reduce cell adhesion, suppress actin stress fiber formation, and consequently induce cell rounding. It is unclear whether simulated microgravity directly affects actin stress fiber assembly to result in cell rounding, or whether cell rounding induced by simulated microgravity is what inhibits stress fiber formation. To quantify these differences in cell shape as a function of clinorotation speed, we computed circularity (circularity=4π*area/perimeter2), as it accommodates more abstract shapes than an aspect ratio calculation. We assigned circularity values above 0.6 to cells that were considered rounded (Figure 3, black), values between 0.3 and 0.6 to semi-elongated cells (Figure 3, hatch) and values below 0.3 to elongated cells (Figure 3, gray). As expected from the previous area measurements, Figure 3 clearly shows that increasing clinorotation speed results in a larger percentage of rounded cells in its population. The number of elongated cells was significantly reduced with increasing clinorotation speed, and no elongated cells were found at 75 rpm. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Human mesenchymal stem cell shape as function of time at different rotation speeds. We analyzed the shapes of hMSCs at different rotation speeds as a function of time for 1, 4, and 8 h; black=rounded cells, line pattern=semi-elongated cells, gray=elongated. Cells were stained with phalloidin (actin, red) and representative micrographs were selected for each morphological configuration. At 0 rpm, cells were rounded at the first hour and were mostly elongated at the end of our time lapse. At 30 rpm, the number of elongated cells was reduced but still present at 4 and 8 h. At 60 rpm, there were no elongated cells at 4 h and there were mostly semi-elongated cells at 8 h. At 75 rpm, the number of rounded cells increases at every time point.Plotting cell circularity against cell area for each clinorotation speed at different time points, we clearly see a temporal increase in area associated with cell elongation in 0 rpm control cells (Supplementary Figure 3). This trend becomes disrupted with exposure to 30 and 60 rpm clinorotation, as cells tended to exhibit a broad range of circularity and area. However, only at 75 rpm the does cell population maintain high circularity and smaller areas across time points (1, 4, and 8 h). Overall, our morphology analysis demonstrates that the cell population at 75 rpm possesses a more consistent morphology (average area, cell distribution, circularity versus area over time) over time.Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation To determine whether there was any loss of viability or if rounded cells were undergoing apoptosis, we exposed cells to 75 rpm and used a live/dead assay after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation (Figure 4b). We found no difference in cell viability or changes in cell number when compared with control; in fact, the majority of cells were alive (>90%). Under light microscopy, we observed no evidence of apoptosis (i.e., membrane blebbing) for the cells that were not viable. This also indicates that our clinochip system can be used effectively without loss of cells due to lifting or cell death for at least 8 h. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cell viability and recovery after clinorotation. (a) Cell spreading dynamics were measured for cells after 1, 4, and 8 h of clinorotation at 75 rpm. Four hours after clinorotation was terminated, cell areas were observed to increase by a factor of 1.4–1.8 times. (b) A live/dead stain was used to analyze both cells in the control and cells exposed to clinorotation, and revealed that cell viability was preserved over time. (c) A fluorescence micrograph for live cells (green) and dead cells (red) is provided to demonstrate the data we analyzed, dotted line indicates the axis of rotation. (d) Time-lapse micrographs illustrate a round cell adopting a more elongated morphology during recovery in standard microgravity.We investigated whether clinorotation effects on cell morphology are reversible by performing time-lapse microscopy after exposure to 1, 4, and 8 h of 75 rpm clinorotation. Following cessation of clinorotation, all cells increased their areas and round cells became more elongated, similar to most of the cells in standard gravity controls (Figure 4a). Similar experiments were also repeated for 30 and 60 rpm after 1 and 4 h of clinorotation (Supplementary Figure 4).Simulated microgravity inhibits cell migration by inducing cell rounding For cell migration experiments, cells were seeded in Ibidi chemotaxis chips with a chemical gradient of 100 ng/ml NGF to promote cell migration. Under clinorotation, only a few cells migrated, whereas most cells did not (see Table 2 for cell numbers). Cells that were actively migrating at 75 rpm had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) when compared with control cells (Figure 5). Cells that were not migrating under simulated microgravity exhibited morphological retraction (Figure 5). In other words, cell areas changed from fully spread morphologies to more rounded ones. This phenomenon is in agreement with our observations in cell-spreading experiments, even when the initial conditions were different (10 min for spreading assays versus 12 h for chemotaxis and migration assays). We found that during clinorotation cells retracted their area, but did so independently of rotation speed (‘0 h’ P=0.539, ‘1 h’ P=0.288, ‘2 h’ P=0.963, ‘3 h’ P=0.848, ‘4 h’ P=0.689, between 30 and 75 rpm). After 4 h of clinorotation during chemotaxis, cells at 30 and 75 rpm reached an average area of 2500 μm2, which is a value similar to the spreading experiments for 30 rpm at 8 h (P=0.962 between 30 rpm, P=0.975 between 75 rpm). However, we did not conduct experiments long enough to determine steady state–retracted cell areas. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Analysis of chemotactic migration of human mesenchymal stem cells in simulated microgravity. Cells stimulated by a chemotactic signal (NGF) in microgravity exhibited one of two behaviors: migration or retraction. Under simulated microgravity, most cells retracted (N=17) and only some cells (N=6) actively migrated. Cells that were actively migrating (left), had a similar velocity (P=0.391) and directionality (P=0.822) in simulated microgravity to those in non-rotated conditions. Cells that did not migrate retracted their area as a function of time. This behavior was similar at different clinorotation speeds (P=0.698 at 4 h between 30 and 75 rpm). Results indicate that the morphological response to microgravity is stronger than the response to the NGF chemotactic signal. NGF, nerve growth factor.Our results indicate that the cellular response to simulated microgravity is more dominant than chemotactic signals, suggesting the role of migration of hMSCs to tissue repair sites might be suppressed in microgravity. We base this conclusion on our observations of response to NGF at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. However, these results were obtained with only one concentration of NGF and it is possible that different concentrations or other chemotactic molecules can elicit a stronger chemotactic response. For example stromal-derived factor-1, which is known to be a strong homing signal for hMSCs.30 Nevertheless, because the response of adhered cells to clinorotation is retraction of cellular processes, we believe that the behavior will be similar, unless the chemotactic agent can also enhance cell adhesion.Discussion Understanding how angular frequency, or rotation speed, of clinorotation affects cell behavior is a critical aspect of microgravity simulation experiments, so that the role of the changing gravity vector in cellular regulation can be appropriately considered. In this work we show that hMSCs can behave differently depending on clinorotation speed. In particular, although average cell area increased more slowly at 30 rpm compared with non-rotated controls, it continues along an upward trajectory at 8 h and seems to be converging with control values. For higher rotational speeds, cell area increases even more slowly, and appears to reach a plateau by 8 h at 75 rpm. This suggests that changes in cell morphology may approach a limit at an angular frequency that is close to 75 rpm, and almost certainly must exceed 30 rpm. Although these results are relevant to our clinochip configuration, results may vary for other clinostat devices, particularly for those that support cells in suspension. Our results are consistent with other research showing that rotation speed affects animal cells, plants, and bacteria (Escherichia coli). For example, a study on osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells reported that rotations at 10 and 40 rpm did not exhibit reproducible, detectable changes from stationary control cells.31 Only a speed of 50 rpm showed reproducible changes in actin cytoskeleton and cell surface integrin β1 and apoptosis. The same effect has been observed with E. coli,32 which exhibited differential response as a function of clinorotation speeds from 10 to 50 rpm. Interestingly, the difference between 40 and 50 rpm is only 0.1674 of a cycle per second, indicating that cells can be highly sensitive to small changes in angular frequency. Although a precise gravisensing mechanism has yet to be determined, it must be one that can detect subtle alterations to external forces in a short period of time. Our data indicate that it is linked to pathways that are involved in cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization, two phenomena that have been observed for different cell types. Potential candidates could be one or more molecules already known to play important roles in cellular mechanoregulation, such as the Rho family of GTPases,33 ion mechanosensitive channels,34 intracellular calcium,35 nuclear deformations,36 focal adhesions, or other cell surface receptors.37 Although mechanosensitive pathways seem the most direct apparatus for gravisensing, others have also suggested the importance of external environmental factors including fluid shear, fluid and nutrient exchange, oxygen content, buoyancy, and changes in the extracellular matrix.38 Thus, clinostats used to probe candidate gravisensing receptors should minimize external environmental variables that arise from clinostat operation. In the context of a proposed framework for cellular gravisensing, the current results are consistent with our working hypothetical model (Figure 1b). Standard gravity would constitute a constant gravitational stimulus and be detectable to all cells. With intermediate timescales of gravitational nullification, the probability for a single cycle of rotational perturbation to evade gravisensing in each cell would assume a broad distribution. As any putative biochemical gravisensing reaction(s) would be stochastic, the probability for gravisensory evasion in each cell would decrease with both lower angular frequency and exposure to longer duration perturbations. We did in fact observe such trends, as a result of the time lapse, single-cell measurement capabilities of the clinochip system. For our clinochips, we do not expect that centripetal forces have a role with our observed angular frequency-dependence, as residual accelerations were calculated to be on the micro-scale regime. In addition, because the capillary number (indicative of viscous forces) is orders of magnitude smaller than surface tension, fluid shear forces are deemed negligible. There is also no enhanced nutrient transport that accompanies clinorotation in our system. Without these confounding factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cell morphology differences we observed were predominantly due to changes in the angular frequency of clinorotation. We believe the rounding and retracted cell area of hMSCs in simulated microgravity inhibit migration in the presence of a chemical gradient. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell area changes during retraction were different from those during spreading, and were also angular frequency independent, suggesting that distinct gravisensing mechanisms may regulate different processes. Similarly, other cell processes, and even cell fate, could be affected.39 In the same way that microgravity may produce these cellular alterations, other mechanical stimuli and substrate characteristics can also modulate cell function.40 Stem cell morphology has a strong correlation with cellular phenotype and differentiation potential.41,42 It has been demonstrated in prior work that spread cells have a higher tendency to undergo osteogenesis and that cells with rounded morphologies are more susceptible to adipogenesis.42 Because of the short-term nature of this current study, it is not possible to establish whether hMSCs in our system would behave according to these trends. However, our data would suggest that cells at 30 rpm clinorotation would be more amenable to osteogenic differentiation, whereas cells at 75 rpm would tend toward adipogenic or chondrogenic lineages. This may help explain the conflicting reports on mesenchymal stem cells differentiation during clinorotation that we and others23 have observed. Future longer-term studies with the clinochip are required to explore hMSC differentiation potential. Specifically, as we have shown that the population distribution of cell morphologies can be controlled by the angular frequency of rotation, we may be able to derive cellular phenotypes desirable for stem cell renewal, repair, and tissue engineering.Acknowledgments Funding This work was supported by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Biology Program, Grant NNX13AM06G.Footnotes Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on the npj Microgravity (http://www.nature.com/npmgrav) The authors declare no conflict of interest.
