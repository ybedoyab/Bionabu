    "abstract": "Summary Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of natural products that contain antibiotics and a variety of other bioactive compounds. The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and they fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. We present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities including human microbiome, lichen microbiome, and micro-organisms isolated from the International Space Station.

    "introduction": "Introduction Natural products are back at the center of attention as pharmaceutical leads, as exemplified by the recent discoveries of bioactive natural product drugs (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009; Harvey et al., 2015; Li and Vederas, 2009; Ling et al., 2015). Recent advances in metagenomics are transforming the field of natural product discovery by enabling the recovery of microbial genomes directly from the environmental samples. This has revolutionized our understanding about the microbial composition of various communities and their biosynthetic gene clusters. Biosynthetic gene cluster are sets of genes that synthesize microbial small molecules from simple building blocks. The metagenomes of microbial communities contain thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with unknown small molecule products, making them an untapped resource for the future antimicrobial drug discovery (Charlop-Powers et al., 2016; Donia et al., 2014; Hadjithomas et al., 2015). The biosynthetic gene clusters of natural products in microbial genomes can be identified by sequence similarity searches (Li et al., 2009). Moreover, in the case of peptide natural products (PNPs), it is possible to predict the corresponding putative structures based on the genes present in their biosynthetic gene clusters (Oman and van der Donk, 2010; Stachelhaus et al., 1999). However, the structure of PNPs usually differs from these predictions due to post-translational modifications applied by the enzymes in the biosynthetic gene cluster. For example, in the case of polytheonamides, the PNP has 49 residues, with 21 post-translational modifications, making it nearly impossible to predict the PNP structure solely based on the genomic data. Therefore, in addition to genome mining, metabolomics methods including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance are routinely used for determining the structure of the molecular product of biosynthetic gene cluster (Doroghazi et al., 2014; Medema et al., 2014; Mohimani et al., 2014a; Mohimani et al., 2014b). The recent launch of the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure (Wang et al., 2016) brought together over a thousand laboratories worldwide that have already generated an unprecedented amount of tandem mass spectra of natural products. Computational mass spectrometry methods have revealed thousands of known small molecules and their unknown variants in various microbiome datasets from the GNPS molecular networking (Gurevich et al., 2018; Mohimani et al., 2017; Mohimani et al., 2018). However, the majority of the spectra in these datasets remains unannotated, which is often referred as the ‘dark matter of metabolomics’. A portion of these spectra represent unknown small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters encoded in the microbial genomes, and computational algorithms are needed for illuminating this dark matter (Donia and Fischbach, 2015; Medema and Fischbach, 2015; Mohimani and Pevzner, 2016; Vaniya and Fiehn, 2015; Walsh, 2015). This paper focuses on the integration of computational mass spectrometry and genome mining for discovering unknown Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs). RiPPs are a rapidly expanding group of natural products with applications in pharmaceutical and food industries (Arnison et al., 2013). RiPPs are produced through the Post Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis (PRPS) pathway (Arnison et al., 2013). Initially, RiPPs are synthesized as precursor peptides encoded by RiPP structural genes. The RiPP structural genes are often short, making their annotations difficult (Mohimani et al., 2014a). The precursor peptide consists of a prefix leader peptide appended to a suffix core peptide. The leader peptide is important for the recognition by the RiPP post-translational modification enzymes and for exporting the RiPP out of the cell. The core peptide is post-translationally modified by the RiPP biosynthetic machinery, proteolytically cleaved from the leader peptide to yield the mature RiPP, and exported out of the cell by transporters. The precursor peptide and the enzymes responsible for its post-translational modifications (PTMs), proteolytic cleavage, and transportation are usually located within a contiguous biosynthetic gene cluster of the RiPP. The length of a microbial RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster typically varies from 1,000 to 40,000 bp (average length 10,000 bp). Since RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters are much longer than the current length of short reads generated by next generation sequencing, DNA assembly is a critical part of any RiPP discovery approach based on short reads. Genome mining refers to the interpretation of a natural product biosynthetic gene cluster to infer information about the natural product itself. The discoveries of coelichelin in Streptomyces coelicolor (Challis and Ravel, 2000; Lautru et al., 2005) and orfamide in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 (Gross et al., 2007; Paulsen et al., 2005) were the first examples of genome mining that were followed by discoveries of various bioactive RiPPs in microbial samples. Donia et al. discovered lactocillin, a thiopeptide antibiotic from the human vaginal isolates that showed activity against vaginal pathogens (Donia et al., 2014). Zhao et al. discovered eight novel lanthipeptides with antibiotic activity from a ruminant bacterium (Zhao and van der Donk, 2016). Freeman et al. and Wilson et al. used metagenome mining of a sponge to assign a biosynthetic gene cluster to the known RiPP polytheonamide, with post-translational modifications distributed across 49 residues (Freeman et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014). Thus, large-scale metagenomics projects, such as Earth Microbiome Project (Gilbert et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2017), American Gut Project (McDonald et al., 2018), and Human Microbiome Project (Human Microbiome Project, 2012a, b; Lloyd-Price et al., 2017), have the potential to contribute to RiPP discovery, provided that improved bioinformatics tools for the enhanced identification of novel RiPPs are available. However, discovery of lactocillin and other recently identified RiPPs were not achieved by an automated process, but rather used time-consuming manual analysis that required the isolation of microbes, and the purification of microbial metabolites. Our goal is to discover the RiPPs directly from the mass spectrometry and metagenomics information using a fully automated approach. While recent analysis of thousands of bacterial and fungal genomes has already resulted in the discovery of many putative biosynthetic gene clusters, including 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in the Integrated Microbial Genome Atlas of biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC), connecting these biosynthetic gene clusters to their metabolites has not kept pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing (Hadjithomas et al., 2015). Currently, only 35 out of these roughly 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in IMG-ABC have been experimentally connected to their RiPPs (Hadjithomas et al., 2015; Medema et al., 2015). Linking RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters to unknown RiPPs requires the development of computational tools. Kersten et al. introduced the peptidogenomics approach to RiPP discovery, which refers to finding sequential amino acid tags from the tandem mass spectra (peptidomics) and mining them in the assembled DNA reads obtained from the same sample (Kersten et al., 2011). Mohimani et al. introduced RiPPquest, the first automated approach to RiPP discovery by combining mass spectrometry and genome mining (Mohimani et al., 2014a). This tool is based on Peptide-Spectrum Matches, which are generated by aligning predicted spectra of putative RiPPs annotated by genome mining. If a peptide-spectrum match between a candidate RiPP predicted from the assembled genome and a spectrum is statistically significant, then RiPPquest reports it as a putative annotation of the spectrum. RiPPquest resulted in the identification of the lanthipeptide ‘informatipeptin’, the first natural product discovered in a fully automatic fashion by a computer. However, RiPPquest has a number of limitations: (a) it is limited to lanthipeptides which constitutes only one of 19 classes of RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013), (b) it is designed for small genomes and small spectral datasets, making it rather slow in the case of large metagenomic datasets and the entire GNPS infrastructure, (c) it does not report the statistical significance of the identified RiPPs, a key requirement for any high-throughput peptide identification tool, and (d) it is limited to searches for a predefined set of post-translational modification (PTMs) and does not enable blind searches for unknown PTMs. Since RiPPquest, other tools have been developed that combine genomics with mass spectrometry based discovery (Medema et al., 2014; Skinnider et al., 2015). However, these tools are limited to the analysis of a single or few spectra from isolated genomes and cannot scale to search billions of spectra from GNPS against metagenomics datasets. This paper describes MetaMiner, a tool that enables searching mass spectrometry databases against metagenomics short reads sequenced from microbiome samples for rapid discovery of RiPPs. Application of MetaMiner to mass spectrometry and metagenomics data from the human microbiome resulted in the identification of known and unknown peptides from the human microbiota, including autoinducer peptide (AIP), Mec-PSM, delta-toxin, and their unknown variants.",

This study did not generate new unique reagents. METHOD DETAILS Datasets. We analyzed the following paired datasets of spectra and genome/metagenome data (all datasets, with the exception of the BACIL dataset, contain high-resolution spectra): Standard dataset (STANDARD). This small dataset consists of 18 spectra of known RiPPs that were used for benchmarking MetaMiner (GNPS datasets MSV000079506 and MSV000079622). Spectra were collected from purified RiPPs from Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313 (four analogs of prochlorosins), Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80 (geobacillin), Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610 (sublancin), Bacillus halodurans C-125 (haloduracin), Lactococcus lactis (lacticin), Bacillus cereus SJ1 (two analogs of bicereusins) and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 (eight analogs of flavecins). For these strains, we used genome sequence information available from the  RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 70 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 29 RiPP-encoding clusters. Since the genome sequence of the lacticin producer is not available, we searched its spectrum against its described biosynthetic gene clusters (Rince et al., 1997).Actinomycetes dataset (ACTI). This dataset consists of 473,135 spectra from bacterial extracts of 36 Actinomycetales strains with sequenced genomes (Duncan et al., 2015; Mohimani et al., 2014b) (GNPS datasets MSV000078839 and MSV000078604). We downloaded sequence information for these 36 genomes from the  RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 168 RiPP-encoding clusters. Furthermore, we downloaded and mixed the short reads from 21 out of 36 strains that were available from the  Short Reads Archive (read length 150 bp, insert sizes varying between 200 bp to 300 bp). We randomly down-sampled each dataset to 10 million reads (resulting in an approximate 300-fold coverage), and mixed all the reads to simulate a metagenomic dataset for this sample. Running MetaMiner on the separate genomes from this dataset resulted in the same set of identified RiPPs as obtained from the simulated metagenome.Bacillus dataset (BACIL). This dataset consists of 40,051 low-resolution spectra from bacterial extracts of two Bacillus strains with known genomes (Nguyen et al., 2013) (MSV000078552). We downloaded genome sequence information for these isolates from the  RefSeq dataset. AntiSMASH identified 12 biosynthetic gene clusters (one RiPP-encoding cluster) in B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 and 11 biosynthetic gene clusters (four RiPP-encoding clusters) in B. licheniformis ES-221.Space station dataset (SPACE). This dataset consists of 58,422 spectra from bacterial extracts of 21 isolated strains collected at the International Space Station (MSV000080102). Among these strains, twelve are Staphylococcus, six Bacillus, four Enterobacteria and one Acinetobacter strain. The complete genomes are available for all of these strains (Singh et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). AntiSMASH identified 119 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 27 RiPP-encoding clusters.Sponge dataset (SPONGE). This dataset contains 223,135 spectra from bacterial extracts of Theonella swinhoei (GNPS dataset MSV000078670). Wilson et al. (Wilson et al., 2014) used the SPONGE dataset to analyze the RiPP polytheonamide. We searched spectra from the SPONGE dataset against the genome of Theonella swinhoei symbiont Candidatus Entotheonella sp. TSY1. In this dataset, AntiSMASH identified 27 biosynthetic gene clusters, including four RiPP-encoding clusters.Cyanobacteria dataset (CYANO). This dataset consists of 11,921,457 spectra from the extracts of 317 cyanobacterial samples (Luzzatto-Knaan et al., 2017) (GNPS dataset MSV000078568). Each sample represents a mini-metagenome (Nurk et al., 2013; Nurk et al., 2017) with one or a few highly abundant strains. The metagenomic reads were collected from 195 of these samples. AntiSMASH identified 2,898 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 195 cyanobacterial metagenomes, including 491 RiPP-encoding clusters.Reference Human Microbiome isolates (HUMAN-iso). This dataset contains 137,556 spectra from 17 human microbiome isolates (GNPS dataset MSV000078556). AntiSMASH identified 55 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 17 human microbiome isolate references, including 12 RiPP-encoding clusters.Human Microbiome isolates from Cystic Fibrosis patients. (HUMAN-CF). This dataset contains 7,554,646 spectra from 276 microbial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients, (GNPS dataset MSV000080251). The short reads were collected on these 276 samples, and each sample contains a mixture of few (from one to eleven) bacteria. AntiSMASH identified 1,111 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 171 RiPP-encoding clusters.MetaMiner pipeline. MetaMiner works with paired genomic/metagenomic and tandem mass spectral data collected on isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. The genomic input to MetaMiner could be short-read data, genome assemblies or extracted biosynthetic gene clusters, in fastq or fasta format. The mass spectral input to MetaMiner is in MGF or mzXML format. If the input is short read data, MetaMiner first assembles the reads into contigs. The pipeline for MetaMiner is described below: (a) Constructing the database of putative RiPP precursor peptides. MetaMiner uses two strategies to search for precursor peptides, motif-ORF and all-ORF strategy. The motif-ORF strategy is based on the annotations from antiSMASH (Medema et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2015), and BOA (Morton et al., 2015). In this mode, MetaMiner first extracts genes related to secondary metabolites and their neighboring fragments from antiSMASH and BOA annotations. Then, putative peptides are constructed based on the ORFs within these clusters that are sequentially similar to known RiPPs. This strategy usually identifies a small number of putative precursor peptides per biosynthetic gene cluster, resulting in a fast and specific peptidogenomics approach. This strategy is not sensitive, as the peptides that do not have sequence similarity to the known RiPPs are missed. In all-ORF mode, MetaMiner (i) translates DNA sequence into protein sequence using 6-frame translation, (ii) runs HMMer (Eddy, 2011) on the resulting sequences to detect all the modification enzymes, (iii) constructs a 10kbp window centered at each modification enzyme (this window is called the putative biosynthetic gene cluster), (iv) identifies all the ORFs shorter than a pre-defined threshold (default is 200 amino acids) in each putative biosynthetic gene cluster. This approach is capable of discovering RiPPs that do not have any sequence similarity to the known RiPPs. (b) Constructing target and decoy databases of post-translantionally modified RiPPs. To construct the target RiPP structure database, MetaMiner first searches the biosynthetic gene clusters for all the modification enzymes previously reported in RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013) using HMMer. If a specific modification enzyme is found in a biosynthetic gene cluster, MetaMiner considers the corresponding modification for the identified precursor peptide/peptides. Table S3 lists the modifications currently considered by MetaMiner, along with the corresponding amino acid residues and mass shifts. To construct the database of decoy RiPPs, MetaMiner (i) creates a decoy database of RiPP precursor peptides by randomly shuffling each peptide in the target precursor database (Elias and Gygi, 2007), and (ii) creates decoy RiPPs from decoy precursors in the same way as the target RiPPs. (c) Matching spectra against the target and decoy RiPPs. MetaMiner uses a modified version of Dereplicator (Mohimani et al., 2017) for searching spectra against the database of putative target/decoy RiPPs as follows (i) theoretical spectra for all the target/decoy RiPPs are constructed, (ii) peptide-spectrum matches are generated and scored, (iii) p-values of the peptide-spectrum matches are computed using MS-DPR (Mohimani et al., 2013), (iv) false discovery rates are computed using the decoy database, and (v) statistically significant peptide-spectrum matches are output as putative RiPP identifications. While exhaustive generation of the candidate RiPPs and scoring by Dereplicator is feasible when a small number of modifications are considered, the running time rapidly increases with the increase in the number of modifications. We use the spectral alignment technique to efficiently find modifications of the core peptide that best matches the spectrum (Mohimani et al., 2014a; Pevzner et al., 2000; Pevzner et al., 2001; Tsur et al., 2005). This dynamic programming approach restricts the number of modifications and penalizes high score matches with more than one modification. While the dynamic programming approach from RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a) can handle modifications in linear peptides, it is not applicable to cyclic peptides. MetaMiner uses a brute-force approach to search all the RiPP modifications of each candidate cyclic peptide against all the spectra. To make this possible, MetaMiner uses a faster scoring strategy that utilized the sparsity of mass spectra and theoretical spectra. We do not currently perform blind modification searches for cyclic peptides due to the inherent computational complexity. (d) Enlarging the set of identified RiPPs via spectral networking. The set of RiPP identifications is enlarged via spectral networks (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012).Post-translational modifications of RiPPs. While constructing target and decoy databases of post-translationally modified RiPPs (Figure 1b), MetaMiner considers various types of modifications based on the class of the RiPPs. Table S3 lists the modifications considered by MetaMiner.Extraction and tandem mass spectrometry. Below we describe the process of growth (for isolated samples), extraction, and analysis of each dataset by mass spectrometry. ACTI dataset. A total of 39 strains of Streptomyces were grown on A1, MS and R5 agar, extracted sequentially with ethyl acetate, butanol and methanol, and analyzed on Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1260 LC system.BACIL dataset. Bacillus strains were grown on ISP2 agar, extracted with a solvent mixture of 65:35 acetonitrile:water with 0.05% formic acid, and analyzed on a NanoDESI LTQ-FT (Thermo Electron) mass spectrometer.SPACE dataset. Samples from International Space Station were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP-UHPLC.CYANO dataset. A total of 317 cyanobacterial collections were extracted repetitively with CH2Cl2:MeOH 2:1, dried in vacuo, and fractionated into nine fractions (A-I) by silica gel vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) using a stepwise gradient of hexanes/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH, and analyzed on a Maxis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP-UHPLC.HUMAN-iso dataset. Cultures of reference human microbiome isolates were extracted using 50% EtOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific) as described here (Bouslimani et al. 2015).HUMAN-CF dataset. Microbial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis qTof mass spectrometer coupled to UltiMate 3000 Dionex UPLC system.Confirmation of wewakazole structure. HESIRMS data was collected using an Agilent 6230 Accurate-Mass TOFMS in positive ion mode by the UCSD Chemistry and Biochemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility. UV-Vis data were recorded on a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer at room temperature in MeOH (λmax at 214 nm and 217 nm). The ECCD spectrum was measured in MeOH using an Aviv 215 CD spectrometer. Optical rotation was measured at 25 °C using a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter ([α]25 −3.9 (c 0.022, MeOH) (lit. (Nogle et al., 2003), [α]21D −46.8 (c 0.41, MeOH)). A Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz NMR with a 1.7 mm dual tune TCI cryoprobe was used to record 1H, HMBC and HSQC NMR data at 298 °K with standard Bruker pulse sequences. A Varian Vx 500 NMR with a cold probe and z-gradients was used to record 1H NMR data at 298 K with standard pulse sequences. NMR data were recorded in CDCl3 and calibrated using residual solvent peaks (δH 7.26 and δC 77.16). For LC-MS analysis, a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC System was used with a Phenomenex Kinetex 5 μm C18 100 × 4.6 mm column coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ Advantage Max Mass Spectrometer. Samples were separated using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN + 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 30% B followed by an increase to 99% B over 17 min, which was held at 99% B for 5 min and then moved to 30% B in 1 min, and then held for 4 min. Mass spectra were acquired with an ESI source ranging from m/z 200-1600. Preparative HPLC was done using a Kinetex 5 μm C18 150 × 10.0 mm semi-preparative column coupled to a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 pump, RS autosampler, RS diode array detector, and automated fraction collector.Isolation of wewakazole. The fraction in which MetaMiner identified wewakazole from sample PNG26APR06-4. This fraction (26.5 mg) was initially separated using a 500 mg/8mL Xpertek® C18 SPE cartridge with 100% CH3CN to yield 10.7 mg after concentration under vacuum. The compound was isolated from this eluent by semi-preparative HPLC using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN at a flow rate of 4 mL/min, and the chromatogram was monitored at 218 nm. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 40% B followed by an increase to 95% B in 25 min. Approximately 2.5 mg of the sample were injected per run to yield 31.2 mg of wewakazole (tR=13.0 min).Practical guidelines for MetaMiner. MetaMiner takes paired genomic and metabolomics data as input. For genomic data, MetaMiner accepts raw nucleotide sequences (.fasta file), antiSMASH output (.final.gbk file) or BOA output (.fasta file). For users who have raw DNA short reads data (.fastq file), we provide a brief guidance about how to assemble the short read by SPAdes/metaSPAdes in the MetaMiner manual. For metabolomics data, MetaMiner accepts MGF or mzXML files. MetaMiner output is the report of the detected RiPPs in the plain text tab-separated files (.tsv). The spectral network step can be done either through the MetaMiner pipeline, or the GNPS infrastructure (https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/). For more details, please refer to the MetaMiner manual at https://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Estimating false discovery rate For each dataset, we use 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for RiPP identification. The FDR is estimated with a target-decoy approach. For each target RiPP, we create a corresponding decoy RiPP by first randomly shuffling its precursor peptide sequence and then applying all the modifications of the target RiPP to the shuffled precursor peptide. Given a p-value threshold, denote the number of peptide-spectrum matches in the decoy database and target database as Ndecoy and Ntarget. The FDR can be estimated as follows: FDR=NdecoyNtarget DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY MetaMiner is available as a command line tool at https://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner.",

MetaMiner pipeline (Figure 1) analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative biosynthetic gene clusters and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed RiPP structure databases using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012). Figure 1. Open in a new tab MetaMiner pipeline analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative Biosynthetic gene cluster and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed post-translationally modified RiPP structures database using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012). In addition to DNA assemblies, MetaMiner software can also accept various types of input data, including shotgun reads data, antiSMASH output and BOA output. Advances of MetaMiner. In step (a), MetaMiner searches for diverse classes of RiPPs, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, linear azole containing peptides (LAPs), linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, phenol-soluble modulins, AIP, and proteusins (versus only lanthipeptides by RiPPquest). Moreover, MetaMiner supports searching for user-defined classes of RiPPs. In step (b)-(c), MetaMiner implement an approach to estimate false discovery rate through target decoy analysis by searching mass spectra against decoy RiPP structures generated by random shuffling. In step (c), MetaMiner uses an efficient algorithm for searching sparse vectors corresponding to mass spectra and RiPP structures, increasing the speed by two orders of magnitude compared to RiPPquest, thus enabling searches of the entire GNPS databases against metagenomes. Unusual modifications are handled through blind post-translational modification searching. In addition, in contrast to RiPPquest (which was designed for analyzing low-resolution spectra), MetaMiner enables searching high-resolution mass spectra, and allows user-adjustable precursor and product ion thresholds. Genome mining. MetaMiner uses antiSMASH, and BOA for the identification of RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters and has two genome mining modes for selecting Open Reading Frames (ORFs), a slow all-ORF mode introduced in RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a), and a fast motif-ORF mode. The all-ORF approach analyzes all short ORFs within a biosynthetic gene cluster, while the motif-ORF approach relies on RiPP motif finding (Blin et al., 2014) to narrow the set of putative RiPP-encoding ORFs. We illustrate positive and negative features of these approaches through genome mining of the Streptomyces roseosporous NRRL 11379 genome obtained from the ACTI dataset (see STAR methods for details of all the datasets). AntiSMASH found 30 biosynthetic gene clusters in this genome, including six RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. Within these six biosynthetic gene clusters, the motif-ORF approach identified only two short ORFs matching core RiPP motifs, while the all-ORF approach identified 14,694 short ORFs. When analyzing all the 36 strains from the ACTI strains, antiSMASH discovered 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 168 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. MetaMiner in the motif-ORF and all-ORF modes identified 67 and 565,138 short ORFs, respectively. This example illustrates that the motif-ORF mode may result in a four order of magnitude reduction in the number of ORF candidates as compared to the all-ORF mode. However, antiSMASH predictions are based on searching for a set of known motifs, therefore the motif-ORF mode misses some ORFs with novel RiPP motifs. BOA is based on identifying known proximal genes (“context genes”) that reside next to a RiPP, rather than by the RiPP sequence itself. Therefore, BOA has a capability to identify non-orthologous RiPP replacements if those RiPPs maintain homologous context genes. However, if the RiPPs do not have context genes, BOA may not detect those RiPPs. Also, since BOA is trained on bacteriocin context genes only, it is most suited for that type of RiPPs. Although the all-ORF mode searches a larger set of ORFs than the motif-ORF mode, it does not necessarily result in an increased number of identified RiPPs after matching ORFs against the spectral dataset. Indeed, the peptide-spectrum matches that are statistically significant in the motif-ORF mode may become statistically insignificant in the all-ORF mode because the search space in the all-ORF mode is orders of magnitude larger than in the motif-ORF mode, resulting in an increased false discovery rate (FDR). Because MetaMiner only reports statistically significant peptide-spectrum matches, the all-ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the motif-ORF mode. Conversely, because MetaMiner searches more ORFs in the all-ORF mode than in the motif-ORF mode, the motif-ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the all-ORF mode. Figure S1 shows a comparison of the performance of MetaMiner with all-ORF and motif-ORF genome mining approaches on the ACTI dataset. At the extremely conservative 0% FDR, MetaMiner in the motif-ORF mode identified three unknown RiPPs and five known RiPPs. MetaMiner in the all-ORF mode identified only two known RiPPs at 0% FDR. Note that while the all-ORF mode improves on the motif-ORF mode for the STANDARD dataset, the motif-ORF mode improves on the all-ORF mode for the ACTI dataset. RiPP Discovery. MetaMiner identified 31 known RiPPs and discovered seven unknown RiPPs in various datasets, including Actinomyces strains, Bacillus strains, Cyanobacteria strains, sponge microbiome, microbial isolates from the International Space Station, and human microbiome (see STAR methods for details). Table S1 provides information about all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR by MetaMiner. Among the 31 known RiPPs, 23 were identified in the strains identical to the previous reports, three were identified in strains with 99% or higher 16S rRNA similarity, two were identified in the same species, one was identified in the same genus, and two were identified in the same samples (Table S2, Figures S7-S11, S13). The seven unknown RiPPs belong to various classes, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, cynobactins, and phenol-soluble modulins classes (Figure 2). Their putative biosynthetic gene clusters contain all the essential genes responsible for the modifications (Figures 2, S2-S6, S12, and S14). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Chemotypes and putative gene clusters of seven unknown RiPPs discovered by MetaMiner as well as wewakazole. In the column chemotype, post-translationally modified amino acids are shown in bold red. In the precursor column, the green part will be cut and modified, to produce the chemotype. In gene cluster, different colors indicate different types of proteins annotated by DFAST (Tanizawa et al., 2018) and HMMER (Eddy, 2011). Confirmation of wewakazole identification. MetaMiner identified wewakazole in a polar fraction from the extract of the strain PNG26APR06-4, a marine cyanobacterium collected at Kape Point, Papua New Guinea. Wewakazole was first reported by the co-authors of this paper (W.H.G.) from another Papua New Guinea collection of Lyngbya majuscula (revised to Moorea producens) obtained from Wewak Bay (Nogle et al., 2003). Subsequently a related compound, wewakazole B was isolated from a Red Sea collection of this cyanobacterium (Lopez et al., 2016). To validate the MetaMiner’s identification of wewakazole from strain PNG26APR06-4, reverse phase C18 column chromatography and preparative HPLC separations were successful in the isolation of 31.2 μg of this compound. The compound possessed the same molecular formula as wewakazole, C59H72N12O12, based on the molecular ion sodium adduct [M+Na]+ in the HR-ESI-MS (m/z 1163.5282, Figure S15). Its chemical identity was further confirmed utilizing 1H, HSQC and HMBC NMR data, which allowed for direct comparison with data previously reported for wewakazole (Supplementary Figure S16-S18) (Nogle et al., 2003). Moreover, the tandem mass spectrum and retention time of the isolated compound matched the data previously reported for wewakazole (Figures S19 and S20) (Nogle et al., 2003). Furthermore, the ECCD spectrum resembled that of wewakazole B (Lopez et al., 2016), and the specific rotation showed the same sign as previously reported for wewakazole (Nogle et al., 2003), excluding the possibility of an enantiomeric relationship of this isolate to that of wewakazole (Figure S21). Thus, the compound identified by MetaMiner was isolated and its identity was confirmed as wewakazole.",
    "discussion": "Discussion While recent genome mining efforts have revealed over 20,000 hypothetical RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (Hadjithomas et al., 2015), only 35 RiPPs matching these biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified so far. To keep pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing, high-throughput methods for structure elucidation of RiPPs are needed that combine metagenomics, genome mining, and peptidomics. MetaMiner extends our previous RiPPquest tool (limited to lanthipeptides) to lassopeptides, LAPs, linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, and proteusins, and enables the blind search for RiPPs with unusual modifications. Studies describing RiPPs are usually limited to the analysis of a single peptide or a few related peptides. The first application of MetaMiner revealed many known RiPPs, as well as their unknown analogs, and seven novel RiPPs (three lanthipeptide, one lassopeptide, two peptide-spectrum matches and one cyclic cyanobactin) along with their numerous analogs, from only eight spectral datasets. MetaMiner identifications were validated by the isolation of the RiPP metabolite wewakezole and confirmation of its structure by orthogonal approaches, confirming that the MetaMiner prediction was correct. In contrast to the existing genome mining approaches that rely on known biosynthetic gene cluster motifs (Weber et al., 2015), MetaMiner in the all-ORF mode has the ability to discover unknown biosynthetic gene clusters (with previously unknown motifs) that encode novel RiPPs (e.g. Compound Bac-ISS-2196 and cyanobactin X) that are very different from all the currently known RiPPs and thus are not captured by the existing genome mining tools. MetaMiner can potentially make RiPP identification as robust as peptide identification in the traditional proteomics. We further evaluated the performance of MetaMiner on eight paired mass spectral and genomics/metagenomics datasets. In a positive control dataset collected on various isolated RiPPs, MetaMiner correctly identified all the 18 known RiPPs. In a dataset collected on various Actinomyces strains, MetaMiner identified eight RiPPs, among which five have been previously reported in similar strains. In a dataset collected on sponge microbiome, MetaMiner successfully discovered a known compound polytheonamide previously reported in the same sample. In a dataset of Bacillus strains, a known RiPP lichenicidin is discovered in an unknown producer. In a dataset collected on strains from the human microbiome, MetaMiner discovered an interesting known quorum sensing autoinducer peptide from a Staphylococcus strain. Moreover, MetaMiner identified multiple phenol-soluble modulins, a class of secreted staphylococcal peptides that have the ability to lyse human neutrophils, the main cellular defense line against Staphylococcus aureus infection. The production of AIP and phenol-soluble modulins have been previously reported in related Staphylococcus strains, but this is the first time these molecules are identified in the human microbiome. MetaMiner also identified a known RiPP, wewakezole, in a cyanobacterial strain, which was confirmed by subsequent isolation and identification by nuclear magnetic resonance. In this paper we used a target-decoy strategy to control the false discovery rate of MetaMiner. For each dataset, we reported all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR threshold. This resulted in the identification of 38 RiPPs after analyzing 10 million spectra. While the discovery of only 38 RiPPs might look pessimistic at first glance, our spectral networking analysis shows that these 10 million spectra cluster into only 8071 families. Moreover, searching these families against known chemical structures using Dereplicator+ shows that many of these families belong to non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes and other classes of natural products. While the discovery of 38 RiPPs by searching 10 million spectra provides a proof of concept for the MetaMiner method, the presented method is applicable to any mass spectral / genomics / metagenomics data collected on the isolated microbes/microbial communities. Currently, only 1% of the spectra from GNPS dataset has been searched against the genomic/metagenomic references using MetaMiner. The other 99% of the spectra in GNPS are not accompanied with the genomics/metagenomics data, making it impossible to search them. Recent genome/metagenome mining studies have revealed hundreds of thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with uncharacterized small molecules from the publicly available genomic / metagenomic data in the  () and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) repositories. A portion of the unannotated spectra in GNPS datasets are likely formed by the small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters from these publicly available genomes/metagenomes. MetaMiner enables rapid search of billions of mass spectra from GNPS infrastructure against the metagenomics/reference genome datasets collected on the microbial communities. MetaMiner is capable of searching large metagenomics and mass spectral datasets in order to construct catalogues of unknown antimicrobial molecules that can be used as drug leads in high-throughput screening efforts.",

The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and they fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. We present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities including human microbiome, lichen microbiome, and micro-organisms isolated from the International Space Station. Keywords: Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, computational mass spectrometry, metagenomics, natural products discovery, microbial metabolitesGraphical Abstract eTOC Blurb We have developed an efficient method for discovering ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides with unknown post-translational modifications from microbial communities through the database search of mass spectra against peptides predicted by genome/metagenome mining. Searching eight datasets collected from various environments including human microbiome, marine cyanobacteria and international space station resulted in the discovery of seven unknown RiPPs.Introduction Natural products are back at the center of attention as pharmaceutical leads, as exemplified by the recent discoveries of bioactive natural product drugs (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009; Harvey et al., 2015; Li and Vederas, 2009; Ling et al., 2015). Recent advances in metagenomics are transforming the field of natural product discovery by enabling the recovery of microbial genomes directly from the environmental samples. This has revolutionized our understanding about the microbial composition of various communities and their biosynthetic gene clusters. Biosynthetic gene cluster are sets of genes that synthesize microbial small molecules from simple building blocks. The metagenomes of microbial communities contain thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with unknown small molecule products, making them an untapped resource for the future antimicrobial drug discovery (Charlop-Powers et al., 2016; Donia et al., 2014; Hadjithomas et al., 2015). The biosynthetic gene clusters of natural products in microbial genomes can be identified by sequence similarity searches (Li et al., 2009). Moreover, in the case of peptide natural products (PNPs), it is possible to predict the corresponding putative structures based on the genes present in their biosynthetic gene clusters (Oman and van der Donk, 2010; Stachelhaus et al., 1999). However, the structure of PNPs usually differs from these predictions due to post-translational modifications applied by the enzymes in the biosynthetic gene cluster. For example, in the case of polytheonamides, the PNP has 49 residues, with 21 post-translational modifications, making it nearly impossible to predict the PNP structure solely based on the genomic data. Therefore, in addition to genome mining, metabolomics methods including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance are routinely used for determining the structure of the molecular product of biosynthetic gene cluster (Doroghazi et al., 2014; Medema et al., 2014; Mohimani et al., 2014a; Mohimani et al., 2014b). The recent launch of the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure (Wang et al., 2016) brought together over a thousand laboratories worldwide that have already generated an unprecedented amount of tandem mass spectra of natural products. Computational mass spectrometry methods have revealed thousands of known small molecules and their unknown variants in various microbiome datasets from the GNPS molecular networking (Gurevich et al., 2018; Mohimani et al., 2017; Mohimani et al., 2018). However, the majority of the spectra in these datasets remains unannotated, which is often referred as the ‘dark matter of metabolomics’. A portion of these spectra represent unknown small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters encoded in the microbial genomes, and computational algorithms are needed for illuminating this dark matter (Donia and Fischbach, 2015; Medema and Fischbach, 2015; Mohimani and Pevzner, 2016; Vaniya and Fiehn, 2015; Walsh, 2015). This paper focuses on the integration of computational mass spectrometry and genome mining for discovering unknown Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs). RiPPs are a rapidly expanding group of natural products with applications in pharmaceutical and food industries (Arnison et al., 2013). RiPPs are produced through the Post Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis (PRPS) pathway (Arnison et al., 2013). Initially, RiPPs are synthesized as precursor peptides encoded by RiPP structural genes. The RiPP structural genes are often short, making their annotations difficult (Mohimani et al., 2014a). The precursor peptide consists of a prefix leader peptide appended to a suffix core peptide. The leader peptide is important for the recognition by the RiPP post-translational modification enzymes and for exporting the RiPP out of the cell. The core peptide is post-translationally modified by the RiPP biosynthetic machinery, proteolytically cleaved from the leader peptide to yield the mature RiPP, and exported out of the cell by transporters. The precursor peptide and the enzymes responsible for its post-translational modifications (PTMs), proteolytic cleavage, and transportation are usually located within a contiguous biosynthetic gene cluster of the RiPP. The length of a microbial RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster typically varies from 1,000 to 40,000 bp (average length 10,000 bp). Since RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters are much longer than the current length of short reads generated by next generation sequencing, DNA assembly is a critical part of any RiPP discovery approach based on short reads. Genome mining refers to the interpretation of a natural product biosynthetic gene cluster to infer information about the natural product itself. The discoveries of coelichelin in Streptomyces coelicolor (Challis and Ravel, 2000; Lautru et al., 2005) and orfamide in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 (Gross et al., 2007; Paulsen et al., 2005) were the first examples of genome mining that were followed by discoveries of various bioactive RiPPs in microbial samples. Donia et al. discovered lactocillin, a thiopeptide antibiotic from the human vaginal isolates that showed activity against vaginal pathogens (Donia et al., 2014). Zhao et al. discovered eight novel lanthipeptides with antibiotic activity from a ruminant bacterium (Zhao and van der Donk, 2016). Freeman et al. and Wilson et al. used metagenome mining of a sponge to assign a biosynthetic gene cluster to the known RiPP polytheonamide, with post-translational modifications distributed across 49 residues (Freeman et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2014). Thus, large-scale metagenomics projects, such as Earth Microbiome Project (Gilbert et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2017), American Gut Project (McDonald et al., 2018), and Human Microbiome Project (Human Microbiome Project, 2012a, b; Lloyd-Price et al., 2017), have the potential to contribute to RiPP discovery, provided that improved bioinformatics tools for the enhanced identification of novel RiPPs are available. However, discovery of lactocillin and other recently identified RiPPs were not achieved by an automated process, but rather used time-consuming manual analysis that required the isolation of microbes, and the purification of microbial metabolites. Our goal is to discover the RiPPs directly from the mass spectrometry and metagenomics information using a fully automated approach. While recent analysis of thousands of bacterial and fungal genomes has already resulted in the discovery of many putative biosynthetic gene clusters, including 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in the Integrated Microbial Genome Atlas of biosynthetic Gene Clusters (IMG-ABC), connecting these biosynthetic gene clusters to their metabolites has not kept pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing (Hadjithomas et al., 2015). Currently, only 35 out of these roughly 20,000 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters in IMG-ABC have been experimentally connected to their RiPPs (Hadjithomas et al., 2015; Medema et al., 2015). Linking RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters to unknown RiPPs requires the development of computational tools. Kersten et al. introduced the peptidogenomics approach to RiPP discovery, which refers to finding sequential amino acid tags from the tandem mass spectra (peptidomics) and mining them in the assembled DNA reads obtained from the same sample (Kersten et al., 2011). Mohimani et al. introduced RiPPquest, the first automated approach to RiPP discovery by combining mass spectrometry and genome mining (Mohimani et al., 2014a). This tool is based on Peptide-Spectrum Matches, which are generated by aligning predicted spectra of putative RiPPs annotated by genome mining. If a peptide-spectrum match between a candidate RiPP predicted from the assembled genome and a spectrum is statistically significant, then RiPPquest reports it as a putative annotation of the spectrum. RiPPquest resulted in the identification of the lanthipeptide ‘informatipeptin’, the first natural product discovered in a fully automatic fashion by a computer. However, RiPPquest has a number of limitations: (a) it is limited to lanthipeptides which constitutes only one of 19 classes of RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013), (b) it is designed for small genomes and small spectral datasets, making it rather slow in the case of large metagenomic datasets and the entire GNPS infrastructure, (c) it does not report the statistical significance of the identified RiPPs, a key requirement for any high-throughput peptide identification tool, and (d) it is limited to searches for a predefined set of post-translational modification (PTMs) and does not enable blind searches for unknown PTMs. Since RiPPquest, other tools have been developed that combine genomics with mass spectrometry based discovery (Medema et al., 2014; Skinnider et al., 2015). However, these tools are limited to the analysis of a single or few spectra from isolated genomes and cannot scale to search billions of spectra from GNPS against metagenomics datasets. This paper describes MetaMiner, a tool that enables searching mass spectrometry databases against metagenomics short reads sequenced from microbiome samples for rapid discovery of RiPPs. Application of MetaMiner to mass spectrometry and metagenomics data from the human microbiome resulted in the identification of known and unknown peptides from the human microbiota, including autoinducer peptide (AIP), Mec-PSM, delta-toxin, and their unknown variants.Results Brief description of MetaMiner. MetaMiner pipeline (Figure 1) analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative biosynthetic gene clusters and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed RiPP structure databases using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012). Figure 1. Open in a new tab MetaMiner pipeline analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative Biosynthetic gene cluster and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed post-translationally modified RiPP structures database using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012). In addition to DNA assemblies, MetaMiner software can also accept various types of input data, including shotgun reads data, antiSMASH output and BOA output.Advances of MetaMiner. In step (a), MetaMiner searches for diverse classes of RiPPs, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, linear azole containing peptides (LAPs), linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, phenol-soluble modulins, AIP, and proteusins (versus only lanthipeptides by RiPPquest). Moreover, MetaMiner supports searching for user-defined classes of RiPPs. In step (b)-(c), MetaMiner implement an approach to estimate false discovery rate through target decoy analysis by searching mass spectra against decoy RiPP structures generated by random shuffling. In step (c), MetaMiner uses an efficient algorithm for searching sparse vectors corresponding to mass spectra and RiPP structures, increasing the speed by two orders of magnitude compared to RiPPquest, thus enabling searches of the entire GNPS databases against metagenomes. Unusual modifications are handled through blind post-translational modification searching. In addition, in contrast to RiPPquest (which was designed for analyzing low-resolution spectra), MetaMiner enables searching high-resolution mass spectra, and allows user-adjustable precursor and product ion thresholds.Genome mining. MetaMiner uses antiSMASH, and BOA for the identification of RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters and has two genome mining modes for selecting Open Reading Frames (ORFs), a slow all-ORF mode introduced in RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a), and a fast motif-ORF mode. The all-ORF approach analyzes all short ORFs within a biosynthetic gene cluster, while the motif-ORF approach relies on RiPP motif finding (Blin et al., 2014) to narrow the set of putative RiPP-encoding ORFs. We illustrate positive and negative features of these approaches through genome mining of the Streptomyces roseosporous NRRL 11379 genome obtained from the ACTI dataset (see STAR methods for details of all the datasets). AntiSMASH found 30 biosynthetic gene clusters in this genome, including six RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. Within these six biosynthetic gene clusters, the motif-ORF approach identified only two short ORFs matching core RiPP motifs, while the all-ORF approach identified 14,694 short ORFs. When analyzing all the 36 strains from the ACTI strains, antiSMASH discovered 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 168 RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters. MetaMiner in the motif-ORF and all-ORF modes identified 67 and 565,138 short ORFs, respectively. This example illustrates that the motif-ORF mode may result in a four order of magnitude reduction in the number of ORF candidates as compared to the all-ORF mode. However, antiSMASH predictions are based on searching for a set of known motifs, therefore the motif-ORF mode misses some ORFs with novel RiPP motifs. BOA is based on identifying known proximal genes (“context genes”) that reside next to a RiPP, rather than by the RiPP sequence itself. Therefore, BOA has a capability to identify non-orthologous RiPP replacements if those RiPPs maintain homologous context genes. However, if the RiPPs do not have context genes, BOA may not detect those RiPPs. Also, since BOA is trained on bacteriocin context genes only, it is most suited for that type of RiPPs. Although the all-ORF mode searches a larger set of ORFs than the motif-ORF mode, it does not necessarily result in an increased number of identified RiPPs after matching ORFs against the spectral dataset. Indeed, the peptide-spectrum matches that are statistically significant in the motif-ORF mode may become statistically insignificant in the all-ORF mode because the search space in the all-ORF mode is orders of magnitude larger than in the motif-ORF mode, resulting in an increased false discovery rate (FDR). Because MetaMiner only reports statistically significant peptide-spectrum matches, the all-ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the motif-ORF mode. Conversely, because MetaMiner searches more ORFs in the all-ORF mode than in the motif-ORF mode, the motif-ORF mode may miss some peptides identified in the all-ORF mode. Figure S1 shows a comparison of the performance of MetaMiner with all-ORF and motif-ORF genome mining approaches on the ACTI dataset. At the extremely conservative 0% FDR, MetaMiner in the motif-ORF mode identified three unknown RiPPs and five known RiPPs. MetaMiner in the all-ORF mode identified only two known RiPPs at 0% FDR. Note that while the all-ORF mode improves on the motif-ORF mode for the STANDARD dataset, the motif-ORF mode improves on the all-ORF mode for the ACTI dataset.RiPP Discovery. MetaMiner identified 31 known RiPPs and discovered seven unknown RiPPs in various datasets, including Actinomyces strains, Bacillus strains, Cyanobacteria strains, sponge microbiome, microbial isolates from the International Space Station, and human microbiome (see STAR methods for details). Table S1 provides information about all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR by MetaMiner. Among the 31 known RiPPs, 23 were identified in the strains identical to the previous reports, three were identified in strains with 99% or higher 16S rRNA similarity, two were identified in the same species, one was identified in the same genus, and two were identified in the same samples (Table S2, Figures S7-S11, S13). The seven unknown RiPPs belong to various classes, including lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, cynobactins, and phenol-soluble modulins classes (Figure 2). Their putative biosynthetic gene clusters contain all the essential genes responsible for the modifications (Figures 2, S2-S6, S12, and S14). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Chemotypes and putative gene clusters of seven unknown RiPPs discovered by MetaMiner as well as wewakazole. In the column chemotype, post-translationally modified amino acids are shown in bold red. In the precursor column, the green part will be cut and modified, to produce the chemotype. In gene cluster, different colors indicate different types of proteins annotated by DFAST (Tanizawa et al., 2018) and HMMER (Eddy, 2011).Confirmation of wewakazole identification. MetaMiner identified wewakazole in a polar fraction from the extract of the strain PNG26APR06-4, a marine cyanobacterium collected at Kape Point, Papua New Guinea. Wewakazole was first reported by the co-authors of this paper (W.H.G.) from another Papua New Guinea collection of Lyngbya majuscula (revised to Moorea producens) obtained from Wewak Bay (Nogle et al., 2003). Subsequently a related compound, wewakazole B was isolated from a Red Sea collection of this cyanobacterium (Lopez et al., 2016). To validate the MetaMiner’s identification of wewakazole from strain PNG26APR06-4, reverse phase C18 column chromatography and preparative HPLC separations were successful in the isolation of 31.2 μg of this compound. The compound possessed the same molecular formula as wewakazole, C59H72N12O12, based on the molecular ion sodium adduct [M+Na]+ in the HR-ESI-MS (m/z 1163.5282, Figure S15). Its chemical identity was further confirmed utilizing 1H, HSQC and HMBC NMR data, which allowed for direct comparison with data previously reported for wewakazole (Supplementary Figure S16-S18) (Nogle et al., 2003). Moreover, the tandem mass spectrum and retention time of the isolated compound matched the data previously reported for wewakazole (Figures S19 and S20) (Nogle et al., 2003). Furthermore, the ECCD spectrum resembled that of wewakazole B (Lopez et al., 2016), and the specific rotation showed the same sign as previously reported for wewakazole (Nogle et al., 2003), excluding the possibility of an enantiomeric relationship of this isolate to that of wewakazole (Figure S21). Thus, the compound identified by MetaMiner was isolated and its identity was confirmed as wewakazole.Discussion While recent genome mining efforts have revealed over 20,000 hypothetical RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (Hadjithomas et al., 2015), only 35 RiPPs matching these biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified so far. To keep pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing, high-throughput methods for structure elucidation of RiPPs are needed that combine metagenomics, genome mining, and peptidomics. MetaMiner extends our previous RiPPquest tool (limited to lanthipeptides) to lassopeptides, LAPs, linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, and proteusins, and enables the blind search for RiPPs with unusual modifications. Studies describing RiPPs are usually limited to the analysis of a single peptide or a few related peptides. The first application of MetaMiner revealed many known RiPPs, as well as their unknown analogs, and seven novel RiPPs (three lanthipeptide, one lassopeptide, two peptide-spectrum matches and one cyclic cyanobactin) along with their numerous analogs, from only eight spectral datasets. MetaMiner identifications were validated by the isolation of the RiPP metabolite wewakezole and confirmation of its structure by orthogonal approaches, confirming that the MetaMiner prediction was correct. In contrast to the existing genome mining approaches that rely on known biosynthetic gene cluster motifs (Weber et al., 2015), MetaMiner in the all-ORF mode has the ability to discover unknown biosynthetic gene clusters (with previously unknown motifs) that encode novel RiPPs (e.g. Compound Bac-ISS-2196 and cyanobactin X) that are very different from all the currently known RiPPs and thus are not captured by the existing genome mining tools. MetaMiner can potentially make RiPP identification as robust as peptide identification in the traditional proteomics. We further evaluated the performance of MetaMiner on eight paired mass spectral and genomics/metagenomics datasets. In a positive control dataset collected on various isolated RiPPs, MetaMiner correctly identified all the 18 known RiPPs. In a dataset collected on various Actinomyces strains, MetaMiner identified eight RiPPs, among which five have been previously reported in similar strains. In a dataset collected on sponge microbiome, MetaMiner successfully discovered a known compound polytheonamide previously reported in the same sample. In a dataset of Bacillus strains, a known RiPP lichenicidin is discovered in an unknown producer. In a dataset collected on strains from the human microbiome, MetaMiner discovered an interesting known quorum sensing autoinducer peptide from a Staphylococcus strain. Moreover, MetaMiner identified multiple phenol-soluble modulins, a class of secreted staphylococcal peptides that have the ability to lyse human neutrophils, the main cellular defense line against Staphylococcus aureus infection. The production of AIP and phenol-soluble modulins have been previously reported in related Staphylococcus strains, but this is the first time these molecules are identified in the human microbiome. MetaMiner also identified a known RiPP, wewakezole, in a cyanobacterial strain, which was confirmed by subsequent isolation and identification by nuclear magnetic resonance. In this paper we used a target-decoy strategy to control the false discovery rate of MetaMiner. For each dataset, we reported all the RiPPs identified at 1% FDR threshold. This resulted in the identification of 38 RiPPs after analyzing 10 million spectra. While the discovery of only 38 RiPPs might look pessimistic at first glance, our spectral networking analysis shows that these 10 million spectra cluster into only 8071 families. Moreover, searching these families against known chemical structures using Dereplicator+ shows that many of these families belong to non-ribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes and other classes of natural products. While the discovery of 38 RiPPs by searching 10 million spectra provides a proof of concept for the MetaMiner method, the presented method is applicable to any mass spectral / genomics / metagenomics data collected on the isolated microbes/microbial communities. Currently, only 1% of the spectra from GNPS dataset has been searched against the genomic/metagenomic references using MetaMiner. The other 99% of the spectra in GNPS are not accompanied with the genomics/metagenomics data, making it impossible to search them. Recent genome/metagenome mining studies have revealed hundreds of thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with uncharacterized small molecules from the publicly available genomic / metagenomic data in the  () and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) repositories. A portion of the unannotated spectra in GNPS datasets are likely formed by the small molecule products of biosynthetic gene clusters from these publicly available genomes/metagenomes. MetaMiner enables rapid search of billions of mass spectra from GNPS infrastructure against the metagenomics/reference genome datasets collected on the microbial communities. MetaMiner is capable of searching large metagenomics and mass spectral datasets in order to construct catalogues of unknown antimicrobial molecules that can be used as drug leads in high-throughput screening efforts.STAR Methods LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITY Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Hosein Mohimani (hoseinm@andrew.cmu.edu). This study did not generate new unique reagents.METHOD DETAILS Datasets. We analyzed the following paired datasets of spectra and genome/metagenome data (all datasets, with the exception of the BACIL dataset, contain high-resolution spectra): Standard dataset (STANDARD). This small dataset consists of 18 spectra of known RiPPs that were used for benchmarking MetaMiner (GNPS datasets MSV000079506 and MSV000079622). Spectra were collected from purified RiPPs from Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313 (four analogs of prochlorosins), Geobacillus thermodenitrificans NG80 (geobacillin), Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610 (sublancin), Bacillus halodurans C-125 (haloduracin), Lactococcus lactis (lacticin), Bacillus cereus SJ1 (two analogs of bicereusins) and Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 (eight analogs of flavecins). For these strains, we used genome sequence information available from the  RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 70 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 29 RiPP-encoding clusters. Since the genome sequence of the lacticin producer is not available, we searched its spectrum against its described biosynthetic gene clusters (Rince et al., 1997).Actinomycetes dataset (ACTI). This dataset consists of 473,135 spectra from bacterial extracts of 36 Actinomycetales strains with sequenced genomes (Duncan et al., 2015; Mohimani et al., 2014b) (GNPS datasets MSV000078839 and MSV000078604). We downloaded sequence information for these 36 genomes from the  RefSeq database. AntiSMASH identified 1,140 biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, including 168 RiPP-encoding clusters. Furthermore, we downloaded and mixed the short reads from 21 out of 36 strains that were available from the  Short Reads Archive (read length 150 bp, insert sizes varying between 200 bp to 300 bp). We randomly down-sampled each dataset to 10 million reads (resulting in an approximate 300-fold coverage), and mixed all the reads to simulate a metagenomic dataset for this sample. Running MetaMiner on the separate genomes from this dataset resulted in the same set of identified RiPPs as obtained from the simulated metagenome.Bacillus dataset (BACIL). This dataset consists of 40,051 low-resolution spectra from bacterial extracts of two Bacillus strains with known genomes (Nguyen et al., 2013) (MSV000078552). We downloaded genome sequence information for these isolates from the  RefSeq dataset. AntiSMASH identified 12 biosynthetic gene clusters (one RiPP-encoding cluster) in B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 and 11 biosynthetic gene clusters (four RiPP-encoding clusters) in B. licheniformis ES-221.Space station dataset (SPACE). This dataset consists of 58,422 spectra from bacterial extracts of 21 isolated strains collected at the International Space Station (MSV000080102). Among these strains, twelve are Staphylococcus, six Bacillus, four Enterobacteria and one Acinetobacter strain. The complete genomes are available for all of these strains (Singh et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017). AntiSMASH identified 119 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 27 RiPP-encoding clusters.Sponge dataset (SPONGE). This dataset contains 223,135 spectra from bacterial extracts of Theonella swinhoei (GNPS dataset MSV000078670). Wilson et al. (Wilson et al., 2014) used the SPONGE dataset to analyze the RiPP polytheonamide. We searched spectra from the SPONGE dataset against the genome of Theonella swinhoei symbiont Candidatus Entotheonella sp. TSY1. In this dataset, AntiSMASH identified 27 biosynthetic gene clusters, including four RiPP-encoding clusters.Cyanobacteria dataset (CYANO). This dataset consists of 11,921,457 spectra from the extracts of 317 cyanobacterial samples (Luzzatto-Knaan et al., 2017) (GNPS dataset MSV000078568). Each sample represents a mini-metagenome (Nurk et al., 2013; Nurk et al., 2017) with one or a few highly abundant strains. The metagenomic reads were collected from 195 of these samples. AntiSMASH identified 2,898 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 195 cyanobacterial metagenomes, including 491 RiPP-encoding clusters.Reference Human Microbiome isolates (HUMAN-iso). This dataset contains 137,556 spectra from 17 human microbiome isolates (GNPS dataset MSV000078556). AntiSMASH identified 55 biosynthetic gene clusters in the 17 human microbiome isolate references, including 12 RiPP-encoding clusters.Human Microbiome isolates from Cystic Fibrosis patients. (HUMAN-CF). This dataset contains 7,554,646 spectra from 276 microbial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients, (GNPS dataset MSV000080251). The short reads were collected on these 276 samples, and each sample contains a mixture of few (from one to eleven) bacteria. AntiSMASH identified 1,111 biosynthetic gene clusters, including 171 RiPP-encoding clusters.MetaMiner pipeline. MetaMiner works with paired genomic/metagenomic and tandem mass spectral data collected on isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. The genomic input to MetaMiner could be short-read data, genome assemblies or extracted biosynthetic gene clusters, in fastq or fasta format. The mass spectral input to MetaMiner is in MGF or mzXML format. If the input is short read data, MetaMiner first assembles the reads into contigs. The pipeline for MetaMiner is described below: (a) Constructing the database of putative RiPP precursor peptides. MetaMiner uses two strategies to search for precursor peptides, motif-ORF and all-ORF strategy. The motif-ORF strategy is based on the annotations from antiSMASH (Medema et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2015), and BOA (Morton et al., 2015). In this mode, MetaMiner first extracts genes related to secondary metabolites and their neighboring fragments from antiSMASH and BOA annotations. Then, putative peptides are constructed based on the ORFs within these clusters that are sequentially similar to known RiPPs. This strategy usually identifies a small number of putative precursor peptides per biosynthetic gene cluster, resulting in a fast and specific peptidogenomics approach. This strategy is not sensitive, as the peptides that do not have sequence similarity to the known RiPPs are missed. In all-ORF mode, MetaMiner (i) translates DNA sequence into protein sequence using 6-frame translation, (ii) runs HMMer (Eddy, 2011) on the resulting sequences to detect all the modification enzymes, (iii) constructs a 10kbp window centered at each modification enzyme (this window is called the putative biosynthetic gene cluster), (iv) identifies all the ORFs shorter than a pre-defined threshold (default is 200 amino acids) in each putative biosynthetic gene cluster. This approach is capable of discovering RiPPs that do not have any sequence similarity to the known RiPPs. (b) Constructing target and decoy databases of post-translantionally modified RiPPs. To construct the target RiPP structure database, MetaMiner first searches the biosynthetic gene clusters for all the modification enzymes previously reported in RiPPs (Arnison et al., 2013) using HMMer. If a specific modification enzyme is found in a biosynthetic gene cluster, MetaMiner considers the corresponding modification for the identified precursor peptide/peptides. Table S3 lists the modifications currently considered by MetaMiner, along with the corresponding amino acid residues and mass shifts. To construct the database of decoy RiPPs, MetaMiner (i) creates a decoy database of RiPP precursor peptides by randomly shuffling each peptide in the target precursor database (Elias and Gygi, 2007), and (ii) creates decoy RiPPs from decoy precursors in the same way as the target RiPPs. (c) Matching spectra against the target and decoy RiPPs. MetaMiner uses a modified version of Dereplicator (Mohimani et al., 2017) for searching spectra against the database of putative target/decoy RiPPs as follows (i) theoretical spectra for all the target/decoy RiPPs are constructed, (ii) peptide-spectrum matches are generated and scored, (iii) p-values of the peptide-spectrum matches are computed using MS-DPR (Mohimani et al., 2013), (iv) false discovery rates are computed using the decoy database, and (v) statistically significant peptide-spectrum matches are output as putative RiPP identifications. While exhaustive generation of the candidate RiPPs and scoring by Dereplicator is feasible when a small number of modifications are considered, the running time rapidly increases with the increase in the number of modifications. We use the spectral alignment technique to efficiently find modifications of the core peptide that best matches the spectrum (Mohimani et al., 2014a; Pevzner et al., 2000; Pevzner et al., 2001; Tsur et al., 2005). This dynamic programming approach restricts the number of modifications and penalizes high score matches with more than one modification. While the dynamic programming approach from RiPPquest (Mohimani et al., 2014a) can handle modifications in linear peptides, it is not applicable to cyclic peptides. MetaMiner uses a brute-force approach to search all the RiPP modifications of each candidate cyclic peptide against all the spectra. To make this possible, MetaMiner uses a faster scoring strategy that utilized the sparsity of mass spectra and theoretical spectra. We do not currently perform blind modification searches for cyclic peptides due to the inherent computational complexity. (d) Enlarging the set of identified RiPPs via spectral networking. The set of RiPP identifications is enlarged via spectral networks (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012).Post-translational modifications of RiPPs. While constructing target and decoy databases of post-translationally modified RiPPs (Figure 1b), MetaMiner considers various types of modifications based on the class of the RiPPs. Table S3 lists the modifications considered by MetaMiner.Extraction and tandem mass spectrometry. Below we describe the process of growth (for isolated samples), extraction, and analysis of each dataset by mass spectrometry. ACTI dataset. A total of 39 strains of Streptomyces were grown on A1, MS and R5 agar, extracted sequentially with ethyl acetate, butanol and methanol, and analyzed on Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1260 LC system.BACIL dataset. Bacillus strains were grown on ISP2 agar, extracted with a solvent mixture of 65:35 acetonitrile:water with 0.05% formic acid, and analyzed on a NanoDESI LTQ-FT (Thermo Electron) mass spectrometer.SPACE dataset. Samples from International Space Station were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP-UHPLC.CYANO dataset. A total of 317 cyanobacterial collections were extracted repetitively with CH2Cl2:MeOH 2:1, dried in vacuo, and fractionated into nine fractions (A-I) by silica gel vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) using a stepwise gradient of hexanes/EtOAc and EtOAc/MeOH, and analyzed on a Maxis Impact mass spectrometer coupled to C18 RP-UHPLC.HUMAN-iso dataset. Cultures of reference human microbiome isolates were extracted using 50% EtOH and analyzed on a maXis Impact mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a UltiMate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Scientific) as described here (Bouslimani et al. 2015).HUMAN-CF dataset. Microbial isolates from the sputum culture of cystic fibrosis patients were extracted using 50% MeOH and analyzed on a maXis qTof mass spectrometer coupled to UltiMate 3000 Dionex UPLC system.Confirmation of wewakazole structure. HESIRMS data was collected using an Agilent 6230 Accurate-Mass TOFMS in positive ion mode by the UCSD Chemistry and Biochemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility. UV-Vis data were recorded on a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer at room temperature in MeOH (λmax at 214 nm and 217 nm). The ECCD spectrum was measured in MeOH using an Aviv 215 CD spectrometer. Optical rotation was measured at 25 °C using a JASCO P-2000 polarimeter ([α]25 −3.9 (c 0.022, MeOH) (lit. (Nogle et al., 2003), [α]21D −46.8 (c 0.41, MeOH)). A Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz NMR with a 1.7 mm dual tune TCI cryoprobe was used to record 1H, HMBC and HSQC NMR data at 298 °K with standard Bruker pulse sequences. A Varian Vx 500 NMR with a cold probe and z-gradients was used to record 1H NMR data at 298 K with standard pulse sequences. NMR data were recorded in CDCl3 and calibrated using residual solvent peaks (δH 7.26 and δC 77.16). For LC-MS analysis, a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC System was used with a Phenomenex Kinetex 5 μm C18 100 × 4.6 mm column coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ Advantage Max Mass Spectrometer. Samples were separated using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN + 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 30% B followed by an increase to 99% B over 17 min, which was held at 99% B for 5 min and then moved to 30% B in 1 min, and then held for 4 min. Mass spectra were acquired with an ESI source ranging from m/z 200-1600. Preparative HPLC was done using a Kinetex 5 μm C18 150 × 10.0 mm semi-preparative column coupled to a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 pump, RS autosampler, RS diode array detector, and automated fraction collector.Isolation of wewakazole. The fraction in which MetaMiner identified wewakazole from sample PNG26APR06-4. This fraction (26.5 mg) was initially separated using a 500 mg/8mL Xpertek® C18 SPE cartridge with 100% CH3CN to yield 10.7 mg after concentration under vacuum. The compound was isolated from this eluent by semi-preparative HPLC using a linear gradient with (A) H2O + 0.1% FA to (B) CH3CN at a flow rate of 4 mL/min, and the chromatogram was monitored at 218 nm. The gradient started with a 5 min isocratic step at 40% B followed by an increase to 95% B in 25 min. Approximately 2.5 mg of the sample were injected per run to yield 31.2 mg of wewakazole (tR=13.0 min).Practical guidelines for MetaMiner. MetaMiner takes paired genomic and metabolomics data as input. For genomic data, MetaMiner accepts raw nucleotide sequences (.fasta file), antiSMASH output (.final.gbk file) or BOA output (.fasta file). For users who have raw DNA short reads data (.fastq file), we provide a brief guidance about how to assemble the short read by SPAdes/metaSPAdes in the MetaMiner manual. For metabolomics data, MetaMiner accepts MGF or mzXML files. MetaMiner output is the report of the detected RiPPs in the plain text tab-separated files (.tsv). The spectral network step can be done either through the MetaMiner pipeline, or the GNPS infrastructure (https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/). For more details, please refer to the MetaMiner manual at https://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Estimating false discovery rate For each dataset, we use 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for RiPP identification. The FDR is estimated with a target-decoy approach. For each target RiPP, we create a corresponding decoy RiPP by first randomly shuffling its precursor peptide sequence and then applying all the modifications of the target RiPP to the shuffled precursor peptide. Given a p-value threshold, denote the number of peptide-spectrum matches in the decoy database and target database as Ndecoy and Ntarget. The FDR can be estimated as follows: FDR=NdecoyNtargetDATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY MetaMiner is available as a command line tool at https://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner.Supplementary Material 1 MS1545138-supplement-1.pdf (3.6MB, pdf) KEY RESOURCES TABLE REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Deposited Data Standard dataset (STANDARD) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079506; ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000079622 Actinomycetes dataset (ACTI) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078839; ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078604 Bacillus dataset (BACIL) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078552 Space station dataset (SPACE) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000080102 Sponge dataset (SPONGE) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078670 Cyanobacteria dataset (CYANO) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078568 Reference Human Microbiome isolates (HUMAN-iso) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000078556 Human Microbiome isolates from Cystic Fibrosis patients (HUMAN-CF) tandem mass spectra GNPS ftp://massive.ucsd.edu/MSV000080251 Software and Algorithms MetaMiner This paper https://github.com/mohimanilab/MetaMiner antiSMASH (Medema et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2015) https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/#!/download BOA (Morton et al., 2015) https://github.com/idoerg/BOA SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012) https://github.com/ablab/spades metaSPAdes (Nurk et al., 2017) https://github.com/ablab/spades HMMER (Eddy, 2011) http://hmmer.org/ DFAST (Tanizawa et al., 2018) https://dfast.nig.ac.jp/ Dereplicator (Mohimani et al., 2017) https://github.com/ablab/npdtools GNPS (Wang et al., 2016) https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp Spectral network (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012) https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/networking/ Open in a new tabHighlights: A tool for discovering and post-translationally modified peptides Handles unknown post-translational modifications Enables searching millions of spectra against thousands of genomes/metagenomes Searches for lanthipeptides, lassopeptides, linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, etc. Acknowledgments The work of H.M. and L.C. was supported by a start-up fund from the Computational Biology Department, Carnegie Mellon University.

Copyright notice ID: 7303416 PMID: 32554796 The draft genome sequences of three Sphingomonas strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were assembled. These genomic sequences will help in understanding the influence of microgravity conditions on their potential bioactive compound production and other important characteristics compared to their Earth counterparts.ABSTRACT The draft genome sequences of three Sphingomonas strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were assembled. These genomic sequences will help in understanding the influence of microgravity conditions on their potential bioactive compound production and other important characteristics compared to their Earth counterparts.ANNOUNCEMENT Sphingomonas species have been isolated from a variety of habitats, and some species possess the unique capability to degrade pollutants (1). Some of the species are known for biofilm formation and eventually corrode the metal surfaces (2), production of bioactive compounds (3), and plant-pathogenic characteristics (4). Sphingomonas paucimobilis has been reported to be associated with infections in immunocompromised patients (5, 6). In an ongoing microbial observatory experiment, several microbial strains were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) (7). The generation of whole-genome sequences (WGS) to enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS Sphingomonas species with their Earth counterparts would lead to the identification of the genetic determinants potentially responsible for their important characteristics due to microgravity and elevated radiation conditions. The WGS belonging to two Sphingomonas sanguinis strains and one S. paucimobilis isolate were assembled into scaffolds. Sample collection, processing, and presumptive identification of these isolates based on 16S rRNA gene sequences were published elsewhere (7). Briefly, samples collected from the ISS were processed, and 100 μl of each dilution was plated on Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) agar. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was restreaked onto R2A plates and incubated at 25°C for 3 days. A biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected for each strain and pooled for DNA extraction. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using a ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes; Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using a Bertin Precellys instrument. This was followed by library preparation using the Nextera Flex protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5 to 12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell in paired-end (PE) 2 × 150-bp format. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (8) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained (Table 1) was used for assembly with the SPAdes v3.14.0 (9) genome assembler (k-mer size, 32 to 72 bases). The genome was annotated using the  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) v4.11 (10, 11). Default parameters were used for all software except where otherwise noted. TABLE 1.

The details of the final assembly are shown in Table 1. The phylogenetic affiliations of the strains isolated in this study were confirmed based on the similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences extracted from the genomes (12) and the average nucleotide identity (13). The average nucleotide identities (ANIs) of the queried genomes were calculated using EzBioCloud (14) with their corresponding type strains. Data availability. The WGS and raw data are deposited under BioProject accession number PRJNA629834. The WGS accession numbers are listed in Table 1. The WGS was also deposited at GeneLab (GeneLab data set GLDS-298, https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-298/). The version described in this paper is the first version.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.

Further characterization of these sequences will aid in the understanding of the influence of microgravity conditions on these organisms’ potential pathogenicity.ANNOUNCEMENT In an ongoing microbial observatory experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), species belonging to the class Tremellomycetes were identified (1). This class comprises yeasts, dimorphic fungi, and organisms that form hyphae or complex fruiting bodies (2). In this class, the genera Naganishia and Papiliotrema were amended to accommodate the Cryptococcus albidus clade and a few other Cryptococcus species, respectively (3). Among the Cryptococcus species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are the most common human pathogens; however, recently, there has been an increase in infections caused by non-neoformans Cryptococcus species (4–8). This report presents the draft genome assemblies of four such non-neoformans Cryptococcus species, enabling the identification of genetic determinants responsible for their potential pathogenicity under the influence of microgravity compared to their ground controls. In this study, the draft genome sequences of six strains belonging to the class Tremellomycetes isolated from the ISS were determined (1). Descriptions of the sample collection, processing, and presumptive identification of these isolates were published elsewhere (1). Briefly, samples collected from the ISS were processed, and 100 μl of each dilution was plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 7 days. The single colony obtained was restreaked onto PDA plates and incubated at 25°C for 3 days, and a biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected and pooled for DNA extraction. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using a ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (Lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, USA) after bead beating using a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and depending on the input DNA concentration, 5 to 12 cycles of PCR were carried out to normalize the output. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end (PE) 2 × 150-bp platform with a paired-end module. The data were filtered with the NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (9) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The numbers of filtered reads obtained are listed in Table 1, and they were used for assembly with the SPAdes v3.14.1 (10) genome assembler (k-mer size, 32 to 72 bases). Default parameters were used for all software. The details of the final assembly are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1.

The species were identified based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences extracted from the assembled genomes. The ITS sequence of Naganishia sp. strain IF7SW-B1 retrieved from the assembled genome did not show ≥98% identity to any Naganishia species and, therefore, requires taxonomic characterization. Isolation of Naganishia and Papiliotrema species from the ISS is significant, and their persistence during space flight needs to be further studied. Data availability.

Copyright notice ID: 7393961 PMID: 32732232 The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 28 isolates from the International Space Station were generated and identified as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a pigmented yeast that has been classified as an emerging human pathogen in recent times. These WGS enable the identification of genes responsible for synthesizing compounds with biological implications.ABSTRACT The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 28 isolates from the International Space Station were generated and identified as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a pigmented yeast that has been classified as an emerging human pathogen in recent times. These WGS enable the identification of genes responsible for synthesizing compounds with biological implications.ANNOUNCEMENT Rhodotorula mucilaginosa of phylum Basidiomycota is found in soil, air, food, stool, and other environments (1) and produces carotenoids, making it easily identifiable by its distinctive pink, yellow, orange, or red colonies (2). Carotenoids are important for various biological activities, including vitamin A biosynthesis, enhancement of the immune system, reduction of the risk of various diseases (3), and protection from radiation (4). For these reasons, R. mucilaginosa carotenoids are used as food additives and hold pharmaceutical potential (5). R. mucilaginosa, which was previously considered to be nonpathogenic, has now been classified as an emerging pathogen (6, 7) and has been shown to colonize central venous catheters, causing fungemia due to biofilm formation (8). Among the 28 recognized members of the genus Rhodotorula (9), R. mucilaginosa is the most common species isolated from the environment (7) and the most abundant yeast isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (10). The ability of this yeast to produce biofilms makes it very important to study ISS strains since the harsh conditions of the ISS (microgravity and radiation) were shown to enhance antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation (11, 12). Due to their ability to form biofilms and colonize life support systems, such as water tanks and pipes containing clean water, characterization of whole-genome sequences (WGS) of R. mucilaginosa would allow for the development of countermeasures to eradicate this potential threat. Samples were collected from ISS surfaces using premoistened polyester wipes (10). Each sample was aseptically transferred into 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, vigorously shaken, and concentrated using an InnovaPrep (Drexel, MO) CP-150 concentrated pipette. A 100-μl aliquot from each sample was plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol (25°C; 7 days). A single colony was obtained and restreaked onto PDA plates (25°C; 7 days), and a single colony was collected for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted by using a ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA). To acquire the WGS of these 28 fungal strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol (13). Paired-end sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell paired-end (PE) 2 × 150-bp platform. Quality analysis was performed with FastQC (v0.11.7) (14) to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data. For quality control, adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using the software fastp (v0.20.0) (15), and then the cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (16). Three functions of fastp were used, namely, correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and quality trimming at the 5′ and 3′ ends. SPAdes ran using an option to reduce the number of mismatches and short indels in the final contigs, the automatic read coverage cutoff value, and the default values of k-mer sizes. To assess the assembly quality, the number of contigs, N50 values, median coverage, and the genome size were calculated using QUAST (v5.0.2) (17) (Table 1).

Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment.ABSTRACT The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the order Enterobacteriales. Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment.ANNOUNCEMENT Members of the order Enterobacteriales have been found to exhibit human pathogenicity and therefore pose a health risk for people on Earth and for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (1, 2). The latter is of concern for long-duration missions, as astronauts have been shown to be immunocompromised (3). Importantly, these bacteria are able to adapt to extreme conditions such as microgravity and radiation and thus persist, necessitating the development of appropriate countermeasures to control them. Members of the order Enterobacteriales that were found on ISS surfaces were Pantoea brenneri, Pantoea agglomerans, Kalamiella piersonii, and Enterobacter bugandensis (4–6). On Earth, P. agglomerans and P. brenneri were reported to have been isolated from human infections (4). K. piersonii is a member of a novel genus in the family Erwiniaceae that has exhibited resistance to multiple clinical drugs, such as penicillin and vancomycin, allowing it to be an emerging pathogen (5). E. bugandensis was documented from blood as a causative agent of septicemia in various geological locations (7). Analyses of draft genome assemblies for these species might pave the way to identify the genetic processes responsible for potential pathogenicity, as previously reported for some of these strains (5, 6). The strains used for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were isolated from four different locations in the ISS across three flights and are detailed in Table 1 (8). The ISS surface samples collected and brought back to Earth were aseptically handled, suitable aliquots of the sample concentrate (100 μl) were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) medium and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and a single well-isolated colony was archived at −80°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from cultures grown in R2A medium using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TABLE 1.

The bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain (E. bugandensis DSM 29888T, K. piersonii DSM 108198T, P. agglomerans DSM 3493T, or P. brenneri DSM 24232T). The whole-genome sequence of the nearest neighbor was further selected for ANI evaluation. The ANI value for all strain comparisons was 99%. bHyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F1-2 indicates flight 1 and location 2.

WGS of 26 bacterial isolates from the ISS was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, as used in similar studies (6). The NovaSeq 6000 system with an S4 flow cell (paired-end 2 × 150-bp reads) was used to execute paired-end sequencing. FastQC (v0.11.7) was used to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data (9). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the software fastp (v0.20.0) to perform quality control (10). The cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (11). The N50 values, numbers of contigs, and total genome lengths were generated using QUAST (v5.0.2) and used to assess the quality of the final assembly (12). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were calculated by comparing all strains to their respective type strains, and their taxonomic affiliations and genome statistics are given in Table 1 (13). The  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) (v.4.11 and v.4.12) was used for genome annotation. Default parameters were used for all software. Data availability.

WGS would permit the characterization of these potentially pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the extreme conditions of the space environment.ANNOUNCEMENT The order Lactobacillales consists of Gram stain-positive, facultative anaerobes validly described by Ludwig et al. (1). Members of the genus Enterococcus are found to possess human pathogenicity characteristics such as antibiotic resistance (2) and therefore pose health concerns for those on Earth and astronauts residing in the International Space Station (ISS). However, Aerococcus urinaeequi, a nonpathogenic strain, was first isolated from horse urine (3). Astronauts on long flights are immunocompromised due to microgravity-induced physiological and mental stress. Decreased immune response allows bacteria to take growth advantage due to their adaptability potential in the space environment (4). Understanding the genomic makeup of these potential pathogens will help the development of suitable countermeasure and mitigation strategies. Members of the order Lactobacillales isolated from the ISS and the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) surfaces were Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Aerococcus urinaeequi (5, 6). E. faecalis and E. faecium have been reported as nosocomial isolates harboring vancomycin and ampicillin resistance (5). A. urinaeequi was isolated from a chronic kidney disease patient and has also been reported to be resistant to vancomycin (6). Further characterization of the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these ISS environmental strains, including virulence genes, and subsequent confirmation in animal models are required to decipher their potential pathogenicity. The strains used for the WGS were collected from three different ISS locations across two flights and seven different surface locations, including one field control on CRV6, and are detailed in Table 1 (7). The samples collected from the ISS were brought back to Earth and aseptically processed, and suitable aliquots of the sample concentrate (100 μl) were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) or Trypticase soy agar (TSA) medium and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. A single well-isolated colony on a culture plate was archived at −80°C. Genomic DNA was extracted from the overnight-grown cultures on TSA medium using a ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TABLE 1.

The bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strain. The WGS of the nearest neighbor was further selected for ANI evaluation: A, A. urinaeequi DSM 20341T; B, E. faecalis DSM 20478T; C, E. faecium DSM 20477T. cHyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F1-1 indicates flight 1 and location 1. The WGS of 19 bacterial isolates were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, as used in similar studies (8). The NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform was used to execute paired-end sequencing. FastQC v0.11.7 was used to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data (9). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the software fastp v0.20.0 to perform quality control (10). The cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes v3.11.1 (11). The N50 values, numbers of contigs, and total genome lengths were generated using QUAST v5.0.2 and used to assess the quality of the final assembly (12). The average nucleotide identity was calculated by comparing all strains with their respective type strains, and their taxonomic affiliations, as well as genome statistics, are given in Table 1 (13). The  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline v4.12 was used for genome annotation. Default parameters were used for all software. Data availability.

Copyright notice ID: 7561690 PMID: 33060271 Isolated across four locations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 10 bacterial strains were compared using whole-genome sequencing analysis and were phylogenetically identified as Klebsiella. The whole-genome sequences will aid in comparative genomic studies of ISS Klebsiella strains with Earth counterparts, to gain insight into their adaptation to space conditions.ABSTRACT Isolated across four locations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 10 bacterial strains were compared using whole-genome sequencing analysis and were phylogenetically identified as Klebsiella. The whole-genome sequences will aid in comparative genomic studies of ISS Klebsiella strains with Earth counterparts to gain insight into their adaptation to space conditions.ANNOUNCEMENT The genus Klebsiella was discovered by Carl Friedlander in 1882 from the lungs of patients who had died of pneumonia (1). In infected individuals, Klebsiella species can populate the gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx, surviving on mucosal surfaces, and are known for being highly virulent and resistant to antibiotics (2, 3). When found on Earth, this genus of bacterial pathogens has various degrees of pathogenicity, which can lead to severe breathing problems necessitating a ventilator and rapid on-site treatment (4). When exposed to space conditions, however, Klebsiella species might become immunogenic and thus pose a risk to already immunocompromised astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (5, 6). Since microgravity and radiation in space are reported to induce multiple genetic adaptations in microbial species, such as structural modifications of the cell membrane, that can subsequently alter their virulence (5), the strains identified here might potentially pose a problem for the health of astronauts. Therefore, a genetic comparison is necessary to provide more details on the survival of Klebsiella species, which have gained more attention because classical Klebsiella pneumoniae and its hypervirulent pathotype are becoming increasingly resistant to various antibiotics, such as carbapenems (3, 4, 7). The pathogenicity and resistance of the members of the genus Klebsiella might potentially create a problem for space travel, specifically for the safety of astronauts. Several strains of Klebsiella species, including K. aerogenes (n = 1), K. pneumoniae (n = 1), and K. quasipneumoniae (n = 8), were isolated from various locations on ISS environmental surfaces (8). The flight number, location, and other sampling characteristics of the ISS Klebsiella isolates are detailed in Table 1. Briefly, the environmental samples collected from the ISS and subsequently brought down to Earth at room temperature were aseptically handled according to established procedures (8), and 100-μl aliquots of concentrated samples were spread onto either Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) agar (25°C for 7 days) or blood agar (37°C for 2 days) for isolation of microorganisms. After morphological observation, pure colonies were archived at −80°C until further analyses. Cultures of the 10 Klebsiella strains were grown overnight on tryptic soy agar at 25°C until harvesting and DNA extraction using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Magbead kit. TABLE 1.

Genomes were sequenced using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, and a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (paired end, 2 × 150 bp) was used for paired-end sequencing. The quality was assessed with FastQC (v0.11.7) (9). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were then carried out with fastp (v0.20.0) (10). After quality control, the sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (11). To assess the quality of the final sequences, a QUAST (v5.0.2) analysis (12) was performed to check the N50 values, the number of contigs, and the total genome length (Table 1). The GC contents are 54.96% for K. aerogenes, 57.25% for K. pneumoniae, and 58.11 to 58.13% for K. quasipneumoniae. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the Klebsiella strains were compared to find the nearest neighbor, and phylogenic characterization was determined by calculating the average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the EZBioCloud calculator (13), in comparison with the respective type strains (K. aerogenes ATCC 13048T, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883T, and K. quasipneumoniae 01A030T). Default parameters were used for all software. Data availability.

Further analysis of these sequences will enable us to understand their roles for space and biotechnological applications.ANNOUNCEMENT The family Bacillaceae is composed of mostly aerobic or facultatively anaerobic rods with a Gram-positive cell wall. Members of this group are ubiquitous in nature, found in soil, sediments, air, freshwater, marine ecosystems, and foods and in extreme environments with high temperatures (1). Bacillaceae groups are reported to produce a wide range of valuable and thermostable extracellular enzymes (2). The majority of Bacillaceae can form endospores that are crucial for survival in harsh environments (3, 4). This spore-forming property makes it important for NASA planetary protection purposes because spore-forming bacteria are more likely to survive sterilization procedures and the harsh environments of outer space, making them a potential threat for forward contamination (5). This report presents the draft genome sequences of three species (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, and Paenibacillus polymyxa) belonging to the family Bacillaceae, isolated from predefined surfaces at various locations on the International Space Station. The samples were collected using premoistened polyester wipes (6), brought back to Earth, aseptically transferred to a 500-ml bottle containing 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, mixed by vigorously shaking, and concentrated via a filtration system. An appropriate aliquot of each sample was inoculated onto either Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) (25°C; 7 days) or blood (37°C; 2 days) agar. A single colony from each incubated plate was used for genomic DNA extraction using the ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Zymo Research, USA). All isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing based on similarity to their type strain 16S rRNA, as previously reported (6). To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol (7), using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 (8). Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 (9), and then SPAdes v3.11.1 (10) was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 5′ and 3′ ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the N 50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 (11). Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) (12) was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the 29 Bacillaceae scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. The ANI range was 93.98% to 94.17% for B. amyloliquefaciens, and the ANI was 98% for both B. cereus and P. polymyxa. All other genomic statistics are given in Table 1. TABLE 1.

    "title": "Assessing the risk of transfer of microorganisms at the International Space Station due to cargo delivery by commercial resupply vehicles",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677455/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background With increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions.Results Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes and members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome.Conclusions The metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.Keywords: forward contamination, microbial diversity, commercial resupply vehicle, viability, International Space Station",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spacefaring nations carrying out interplanetary missions are subject to rules and regulations that were designed and instigated by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1967 (COSPAR, 2011). Protocols for cleaning and sterilization are of the highest priority and are regularly practiced and meticulously followed during spacecraft assembly for various missions (Benardini et al., 2014). Cleanrooms are where various spacecraft subsystems, including commercial resupply vehicles (CRV) transporting cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), are assembled. These cleanrooms undergo daily cleaning procedures, including vacuuming and mopping of floors with 70% Isopropanol, high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) air filtration, regular replacement of sticky mats at the entrance, and strict gowning procedures. Utmost care is taken by personal entering these facilities, as they are required to put on face masks, gloves, bodysuits, shoe covers, cleanroom boots, and cover hair and beards with nets (Benardini et al., 2014). These precautionary measures are a part of routine exercises, because humans are the primary source of microbial contamination (Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2015; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). On average, humans shed 1.5 million skin cells an hour which carry approximately 15 million bacterial cells, thus becoming a significant source of the indoor microbiome (Jaffal et al., 1997; Lax et al., 2014). Many reports showed transfer of microorganisms via direct contact to indoor surfaces like keyboards (Fierer et al., 2010), restrooms (Flores et al., 2011), offices (Hewitt et al., 2012), kitchens (Flores et al., 2013), airplanes (McManus and Kelley, 2005; Korves et al., 2013), and hospitals (Kembel et al., 2012; Lax et al., 2017). Because of the human presence in these cleanrooms, their surfaces are not expected to be free of microbial burden. The ISS and CRV assembly cleanrooms, including spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) environments, are strictly controlled and monitored for airflow, water circulation, temperature, and humidity; however, individual differences do exist between the two systems (Checinska et al., 2015). The ISS is a closed system where the air is recirculated after purification, while cleanrooms get a constant supply of fresh air from the outside environment. Additionally, astronauts live and work on the ISS as humans do in a typical household on Earth, while SAF cleanrooms have strict requirements that avoid activities like eating or sleeping. At a given point in time, the ISS harbors around six astronauts with a maximum of around 13 crew, while approximately 50 people can work in a cleanroom every day in a highly regulated manner. Despite high human traffic in SAF, the microbial burden was minimal and ranged between 102 and 104 cells per m2 (Hendrickson et al., 2017). It has also been shown that the cleaning procedures followed at SAF significantly decreased the number of microorganisms, but these procedures led to the selection of hardy, robust microorganisms capable of surviving extreme oligotrophic conditions (Gioia et al., 2007; Vaishampayan et al., 2012; Mahnert et al., 2015). Cargos such as food and equipment for scientific experiments are assembled in clean conditions and delivered to the ISS via CRV. All spacefaring nations impose cleanroom requirements when packaging their cargos that are resupplying the ISS. The objective of this study is to decipher the role of CRV systems in potentially transporting microorganisms to the ISS to understand if CRV could be a source of microbial contamination of the ISS. Sampling of various surfaces of CRV systems (CRV1, CRV2, and CRV3) was carried out prior to launch (∼1 month) and corresponding in-flight sampling of the ISS (Flight 1, Flight 2, and Flight 3) was designed to be within 25–51 days after docking of the respective CRV systems (see Figure 1 for a timeline). This sampling scheme was implemented to help understand whether CRV1 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 1, whether CRV2 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 2, or whether CRV3 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 3. Microbial burden associated with CRV environmental surface samples were estimated using traditional techniques (e.g., colony counts), and molecular techniques like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay and 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (fungi) quantification using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. In addition to characterizing cultivable microbial diversity using the Sanger sequencing method, the CRV samples were more thoroughly analyzed using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. Subsequently, the microbial diversity of the CRV samples was compared with the ISS environmental microbiome (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019) to understand the potential transfer of biological materials from Earth to the ISS.

    "methods": "Materials and Methods In this study, internal surfaces and external ground support equipment (GSE) of three CRV destined to the ISS were sampled (N = 22 and 3 controls; Table 1). Samples collected aboard the ISS were done during the berthing period of their respective vehicles, except for CRV1 (see Figure 1 for a timeline) (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Eight samples were collected in 2014 for CRV1, nine in 2015 for CRV2, and eight in 2016 for CRV3. Since CRV3 vehicle surfaces were extremely clean and all analyses, including traditional microbiology assays, were below detection limits, data pertaining to CRV3 vehicle locations are not presented in this study. Since CRV were not reused during this study, we could not sample from the same capsule multiple times. Efforts were taken to collect samples as close together as possible in subsequent CRV, but due to differences in configuration of each vehicle, it was not always possible to collect samples from the same locations. All CRV sampled were manufactured by the same vendor. TABLE 1. Descriptions of sampling locations on commercial resupply vehicles.

CRV, commercial resupply vehicle; GSE, ground support equipment. Sampling kits were assembled as detailed in our previous ISS studies (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020) to facilitate comparisons between these datasets. Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ, United States) was soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 30 min followed by transfer to a sterile zip lock bag (Venkateswaran et al., 2012). Several locations were sampled on CRV surfaces using polyester wipes, and descriptions of the locations are summarized in Table 1. A single wipe was used for each location by donning sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) to collect a sample of one-meter square area. The samples were stored at 4°C and shipped to Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA, United States) for processing. Microbiological analyses were carried out within 48 h of sampling at JPL. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each CRV sampling session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the sampling location and brought back to JPL along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. If field controls (wipes that were exposed to the CRV environment but not used in active sampling) showed any signs of microbial growth, then negative controls would be assayed for cultivable counts to check sterility of the wipes used for sampling. However, none of the field controls showed any colony forming units (CFU) for all CRV sampling events. Sample Collection and Processing Samples from CRV were processed in the same way as ISS samples from our previous studies (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). Briefly, each wipe was transferred to an individual 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) and vigorously hand shaken for 2 min. The resulting suspension was then concentrated to 4 mL using a CP-150 concentration pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO, United States). Both negative and field controls used in this study were processed the same way as other samples for comparison. The concentrated sample (4 mL) were further aliquoted to four different parts for shotgun metagenome analysis (2 × 1.5 mL; PMA treated and untreated), ATP analysis (900 μL), and for growing microorganisms (100 μL). Due to the measurement of different kinds of microorganisms, that require multiple culture media (3 types) in duplicates, the aliquots kept for growing microorganisms were further diluted (10–1 and 10–2) and used. Culture Based Microbial Diversity Due to proprietary cleaning regimes, the surfaces of CRV might be oligotrophic. Although most nutrient and carbon sources necessary for microbial growth are presumably lacking or at very-low concentrations, these surfaces may still harbor microorganisms that are either dormant or slowly metabolizing. Furthermore, microorganisms adapted to more stringent conditions may not necessarily grow on normal nutrient media. Therefore, to target the slow-growing microbial population, Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A; Difco, MI, United States) media (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985) was used. Similarly, as humans are always near the CRV during the assembly and packaging processes, potential opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms may transfer to the CRV surfaces. As a result, the CRV samples were also plated on blood agar media (BA; Difco, MI, United States) to decipher the potentially pathogenic microbial population. Additionally, the samples were also plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, MI, United States) medium, thus targeting the fungal population on CRV. To estimate the bacterial and fungal populations, the concentrated sample was diluted to a suitable serial 10-fold dilution in sterile PBS. A volume of 100 μl of suspension from the serially diluted sample was spread onto R2A media plates and PDA plates with chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), incubated at 25°C for 7 days for bacterial and fungal population enumeration, respectively. For enumeration of human commensal microorganisms, 100 μl of serially diluted sample was also spread onto BA and incubated at 35°C for 2 days. Distinct isolated colonies were transferred to fresh media and subsequently archived in semi-solid R2A media (dilution 1:10) and stored at room temperature. Strain Identification Bacterial isolates were identified by amplifying partial 16S rRNA genes using the primers 9bF (5′- GRGTTTGATCCTGG CTCAG-3′) (Huber et al., 2002) and 1406uR (5′- ACGGG CGGTGTGTRCAA-3′) (Lane, 1991) and the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of denaturing at 96°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 60 s, followed by another 25 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 60 s and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. The template was either a small fraction of a picked colony in a colony-PCR assay or 5–20 ng of DNA purified from culture via the peqGOLD Bacterial DNA Kit (peqlab, Germany). The 16S rRNA gene amplicons were Sanger-sequenced (Eurofins, Germany) and the obtained sequences were classified using the EzTaxon identification service (Yoon et al., 2017). Fungal isolates were identified by amplifying their ITS region using the primers ITS1F (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGG AAGTAA-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (Manter and Vivanco, 2007) at the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 60 s, annealing at 51°C for 60 s, elongation at 72°C for 60 s, and a final elongation step at 72°C for 8 min. The amplicons were Sanger-sequenced (Eurofins, Germany) and the obtained sequences were classified using the curated databases UNITE version 7.2 (Kõljalg et al., 2013) and BOLD version 4 (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013). Molecular Methods for Quantitation of Total and Viable Microorganisms ATP Assay To determine the total and intracellular ATP from all samples, a bioluminescence assay was performed using the CheckLite HS Kit (Kikkoman, Japan) and the manufacturer’s protocol, as described previously (Venkateswaran et al., 2003). For total ATP assay (dead and viable microbes), four replicates of 100 μl sample were mixed with 100 μl of benzalkonium chloride, a cell lysing reagent and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. To this mixture, 100 μl of luciferin-luciferase reagent was added, and the resulting bioluminescence was measured immediately using a Lumitester K-210 luminometer (Kikkoman, Japan). For intracellular ATP (viable microorganisms), 500 μl of the serially diluted sample was amended with a 50 μl of an ATP-eliminating reagent (apyrase, adenosine deaminase) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature for eliminating extracellular ATP. Following which, the ATP assay was performed as described previously for the total ATP. It has been reported that one relative luminescent unit (RLU), the unit of measurement of ATP, was considered equivalent to approximately one CFU (La Duc et al., 2004).PMA-Viability Assay Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps (Nocker et al., 2007). Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) (Nocker et al., 2006, 2007). It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells (Lin et al., 2011; Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Checinska et al., 2015; Jäger et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). A 3 mL aliquot of the concentrated sample was split into two halves. One 1.5 mL aliquot was treated with PMA (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States) to a final concentration of 25 μM, followed by 5 min incubation in the dark at room temperature. The sample was then exposed to photoactivation for 15 min in a PMA-Lite LED Photolysis Device (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States). The other aliquot with no PMA treatment was also incubated in dark for 5 min followed by photoactivation for 15 min like the PMA treated aliquot. Both PMA treated and untreated samples were then each split into half again. One half (750 μl) of each sample was then transferred to Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, United States) and subjected to bead beating for 60 s to allow cell disruption of hardy cells and spores with a limited loss of microbial diversity. The mechanically disrupted sample was then mixed with the unprocessed counterpart and used for DNA extraction via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, United States), per the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was extracted in 50 μl volume and stored at −20°C until further processing.Quantitative PCR Assay Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, targeting the 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi), were performed in triplicate with a SmartCycler (Cepheid, CA, United States) to quantify the bacterial and fungal burden. The following primers were used for targeting the 16S rRNA gene: 1369F (5′-CGGTGAATACGTTCYCGG-3′) and modified 1492R (5′-GGWTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) were used for this analysis (Suzuki et al., 2000). Primers targeting the ITS region, were NS91 (5′-GTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACAC-3′) and ITS51 (5′-ACCTTGTTACGACTTTTACTTCCTC-3′) (Onofri et al., 2012). Each 25 μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), and 1 μL of template DNA. Purified DNA from Model Microbial Consortium (Kwan et al., 2011) served as the positive control and DNase/RNase free molecular-grade distilled water (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) was used as the negative control. These controls were included in all qPCR runs. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, and combined annealing and extension at 55°C for 35 s. The number of gene copies were determined from the standard curve. The 16S rRNA gene of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 and the ITS region of Aureobasidium pullulans 28v1 were synthesized and used for preparing standard curves as described previously (Checinska et al., 2015). The qPCR efficiency was ∼98% for each run. Negative controls yielded similar values (∼100 copies) despite using either 1 or 10 μL of DNA templates.Metagenome Sequencing DNA extracted from all CRV samples was quantified using the Qubit® Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, United States) and samples were selected based on the minimum DNA concentration requirement (∼10 pg/μL) for metagenome sequencing. Only two samples from CRV1 and two samples from CRV2, with and without PMA treatment, satisfied this cutoff, resulting in 8 samples proceeding to metagenomics sequencing (2 CRV × 2 samples × 2 treatments = 8). Sample preparation for metagenome sequencing was carried out using the Illumina Nextera Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Each library was assessed for quality and fragment size using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States). Adapters were added and ligated to DNA sequences in each library. All libraries were then normalized to 2 mM, pooled together and subjected to denaturation followed by dilution to 1.8 pM concentration, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was carried out using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) resulting in 100 bp paired end reads. Data Processing Adapter sequences and low-quality ends were trimmed from the 100 bp paired end reads using Trimmomatic (version 0.32) (Bolger et al., 2014) with a quality cutoff value set at minimum Phred score of 20 along the entire read length. Additionally, reads shorter than 80 bp were removed, followed by data normalization based on guidelines provided by Nayfach and Pollard (2016). Using the MEGAN 6 lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm (Huson et al., 2016), filtered high quality reads were binned to their respective domain and normalized for semi-quantitative comparative analysis. Assigning taxonomy and function to the filtered CRV metagenome sequences was performed using the MEGAN 6 tool kit (Huson et al., 2016). We used the  taxonomy database (Sayers et al., 2008) and -NR protein sequence database with entries from GenPept, SwissProt, PIR, PDB, and RefSeq, to assign taxonomic features to sequences using the sequence comparison tool DIAMOND (version 0.8.29). Assignments were based on the weighted LCA assignment algorithm of MEGAN 6 (Huson et al., 2007). Additionally, filtered DNA sequences were mapped against protein databases like eggnog (Powell et al., 2011), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), and SEED (Overbeek et al., 2005) for functional analysis. Comparison of CRV and ISS Metagenomes Metagenome data from a previously reported study (Singh et al., 2018) of samples collected from the ISS were analyzed in tandem with metagenome data for samples collected from the CRV. These ISS metagenome samples were collected shortly after unberthing of CRV1 from the station or while CRV2 was berthed to the station (see Figure 1 for a timeline). Analyzing ISS and CRV metagenomes together allowed us to focus on microbial dynamics associated with the transfer of materials from CRV to the ISS. Microbial diversity analyses performed on normalized reads were designed to retain a minimum of one unique sequence to avoid the loss of low depth samples or unique sequences. Furthermore, BLAST hits of ≥20 amino acids and ≥90% nucleotide identity were used for taxonomic and functional studies. Normalized read counts for each sample at multiple taxonomic levels (e.g., domain, family, species, etc.) were exported in matrix form from MEGAN 6 and used in downstream statistical analyses. Statistical Analyses To determine the differences in samples collected from the GSE and internal surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 and to compare them with samples collected from the ISS, several statistical analyses were performed. The non-parametric Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test was used to evaluate differences in microbial diversity detected on internal surfaces of CRV and surfaces of their GSE, across CRV sampling events, and with samples collected from the ISS surfaces. The null hypothesis for the MWW test is that the distributions of microorganisms are equal between two conditions tested (e.g., internal or GSE surface), or alternatively these distributions are not equal. Parametric tests were considered for this purpose, but transformation of these data to satisfy assumptions of these tests was not practical. Samples below detection limit were assumed to have a value of 0.01 for all statistical analyses. These analyses were performed using a custom R script1. To measure the diversity in the microbial communities residing on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, various statistical indices were used, including the Shannon–Weaver index (Shannon and Weaver, 1949), Simpson’s index (Simpson, 1949), and the Chao1 metric (Chao, 1984). To visualize differences in relative species abundance among CRV and ISS metagenome samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated from the normalized read counts was used. Analyses were performed using the vegan R package2 and custom R scripts3 ,4.",
    "results": "Results Microbial Burden Microbial burden assays were aimed at using both cultivation-dependent and independent methods to assess the broad diversity of microorganisms on various locations sampled from CRV1 and CRV2 (see Table 1 for a description of each sample). Since CRV3 did not show any cultivable counts, such information was not obtained. Microbial colonies were isolated from all three locations on the GSE surfaces of CRV1 (locations 1, 2, and 7), and only one internal surface (location 4) as shown in Table 2. Using the R2A media, bacteria isolated from three GSE surfaces of CRV1 ranged between 1.3 × 105 to 2.8 × 106 CFU per m2 while 1.8 × 104 CFU per m2 colonies were isolated from the internal location CRV1-L4, an order of magnitude lower than samples from GSE surfaces. The MWW test of colony counts on R2A media show that the three GSE surfaces of CRV1 harbor a significantly different number of cultivable bacteria than the internal locations (W = 12, p-value = 0.0436). No colonies were isolated from internal locations of CRV1 on BA media while GSE surfaces (location 2 and 7) showed 1 × 106 CFU per m2 and location 1 showed 5.1 × 102 CFU per m2 colonies. Fungal colonies isolated on PDA media from GSE of CRV1 ranged between 3.8 × 104 to 2.9 × 105 CFU per m2 while 2 × 104 CFU per m2 were isolated from the internal location CRV1-L4. The MWW test of colony counts on PDA media show that the three GSE surfaces of CRV1 harbor a significantly different amount of cultivable fungi than the internal surfaces (W = 12, p-value = 0.0436).

The microbial colonies isolated from the CRV2-L1 GSE location were 3.7 × 104 and internal locations of CRV2-L7 and CRV2-L8 were 3.3 × 103 and 9.5 × 102 CFU per m2, respectively on R2A media. The MWW test of colony counts on R2A media failed to show a significant difference between bacterial counts among the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8, p-value = 1.0). About 5.0 × 102 (GSE location 1) and 1.5 × 103 (internal location 7) CFU per m2 were isolated on the BA media. The MWW test of colony counts on BA media failed to show a significant difference between bacterial counts among the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8, p-value = 1.0). About 1.5 × 103 CFU per m2 of fungi were isolated from both GSE location CRV2-L1 and internal location CRV2-L7 on the PDA media. The MWW test of colony counts on PDA media failed to show a significant difference between fungal counts between the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8.5, p-value = 0.8437). The microbial colony counts for the CRV2 were lower by almost an order of magnitude as compared to CRV1. However, the MWW test failed to show a significant difference in colony counts between CRV1 and CRV2 on R2A media (W = 38.5, p-value = 0.2094), BA media (W = 35, p-value = 0.3698), or PDA media (W = 41, p-value = 0.1023). Strikingly, no samples from GSE or internal surfaces of the CRV3 vehicle showed any trace of a microbial population. Identification of cultured microbes revealed the presence of four bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes; Supplementary Table S1) and two fungal phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota; Supplementary Table S1). Almost all the bacterial isolates, besides Pseudarthrobacter, Compostimonas, and Mycobacterium, have also been detected by the metagenome derived diversity analysis, at least at the genus level, whereas half of the fungal isolates (Bullera/Papiliotrema, Cryptococcus/Hannaella/Naganishia, Cladosporium, Dioszegia, Rhodotorula, Periconia, Phialemoniopsis, and Phlebia) were not detected. Cultivation-independent methods used to estimate the microbial burden included ATP and qPCR assays. The intracellular ATP assay quantified the content of live cells, and total ATP quantified both dead and live cells to provide an estimate of the viable microbial population in a given sample. In the case of CRV1, the total ATP content for the GSE surfaces ranged between 105 to 106 RLUs per m2, while all internal surface locations had ATP content lower by four orders of magnitude, except for the CRV1-L4 location which had 1.9 × 105 RLUs per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The intracellular ATP content for all GSE surfaces and one internal surface (CRV1-L4) were similar to their respective total ATP content, thus indicating that almost 100% of the microorganisms were viable at these locations. However, the intracellular ATP content was considerably lower for other internal locations of CRV1 and indicated that only 15–30% of the total microorganisms were viable. Incidentally, cultivable populations were isolated only from the CRV1-L4 sample. In the case of the CRV2, all GSE surfaces showed total ATP content of 105 RLUs per m2, except for CRV2-L2 which had only 101 RLUs per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The total ATP RLU values for all internal locations of CRV2 were similar to CRV1 with only 101 RLUs per m2. The MWW test failed to show a significant difference in total or intracellular ATP content between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 45.5, p-value = 0.3859 or W = 49, p-value = 0.2359). The intracellular ATP content for all internal locations of CRV2 was lower than the respective total ATP content thus indicating that 5–36% of the total microorganisms were viable. The qPCR-based DNA quantification using the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region provided an estimate of the bacterial and fungal burden of the CRV1 and CRV2. In the case of CRV1, the PMA treated samples (viable microbes) from the GSE sample locations had very high bacterial density for locations 2 and 7, ranging between 107–108 16S rRNA gene copies per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2A). However, location 1 (GSE) and all internal locations of CRV1 showed 105 viable bacterial population per m2. In general, the PMA treated CRV1 samples showed 16S rRNA gene copy numbers lower by one to two orders of magnitude for the intact cells from GSE locations samples, while there was an only minute difference in the intact cell population for all internal CRV surface samples. The percentage of the intact cells for both internal and GSE locations of CRV1 ranged between 40 and 64%, except for the location 2 and 6, which had 5 and 100% of the intact cells, respectively. Similarly, the fungal density estimated using quantification of the ITS region showed that the ITS gene copies in PMA untreated samples in CRV1 samples were less by three to four orders of magnitude as compared to their bacterial counterpart. The ITS copies for the PMA untreated samples ranged between 105 and 106 for the GSE locations and 104 ITS copies per m2 for internal locations (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2B). The PMA treated samples for both internal and GSE CRV1 locations showed similar ITS copy numbers to the PMA untreated samples, thus making the percentage of intact fungal cells 90–100% for CRV1-L4 and CRV1-L7. However, the GSE location CRV1-L2 showed only 20% of the intact fungal population. In the case of CRV2, the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of PMA untreated samples for the GSE and internal locations were 105 and 104 copies per m2, respectively. The percentage of the intact bacterial cell numbers determined from the PMA treated samples for both GSE and internal locations were in the range of 36–62% and 34–100%, respectively. The fungal density for the CRV2 samples for both GSE and internal locations for the PMA untreated samples was in the range of 105 and 104, respectively. Additionally, these fungal cell numbers were higher by an order of magnitude as compared to their bacterial counterpart. The MWW test of 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of PMA treated samples showed a significant difference in bacterial abundance between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 62, p-value = 0.01408). The MWW test of ITS copy numbers of PMA treated samples, however, failed to demonstrated a significant difference in fungal abundance between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 50, p-value = 0.107). When comparing 16S rRNA or ITS copy numbers from GSE and internal samples, the MWW test failed to find any significant difference (M = 43, p-value = 0.0675 or M = 39, p-value = 0.08197, respectively). Metagenome Derived Microbial Diversity Samples were collected from three CRV vehicles (25 samples in total; Table 1) and each wipe was either treated with PMA or left untreated, resulting in an analysis of 50 samples, including 6 controls. Among the 50 samples subjected for shotgun library preparation, only 8 samples (4 non-PMA and corresponding 4 PMA treated) yielded shotgun metagenome libraries (none from the controls) and all other 42 samples were below the detection limit (0.01 ng DNA/μL). Subsequently, these low DNA concentration samples (42 samples) did not produce any shotgun metagenome sequences. High quality metagenome reads were obtained for four samples; one each from GSE (CRV1-L2; CRV2-L1) and internal (CRV1-L4; CRV2-L7) locations. Interestingly, the microbial burden (both cultivable and qPCR assays) of these four sites were high when compared to other locations (Table 2). At the domain level, bacteria dominated the microbial diversity detected in the metagenomes sampled from internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. In the case of CRV1, bacteria at both internal (CRV1-L4) and GSE (CRV1-L2) locations constituted 99 and 88% of the total reads from PMA treated samples, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3). PMA treated samples from CRV2 were very similar to CRV1 samples when compared at the domain level, both GSE (CRV2-L1) and internal (CRV2-L7) locations were dominated by bacteria (90 and 94%, respectively). Most of the remaining reads belonged to Eukaryota, constituting <1–12% of the total reads from CRV1 and CRV2 internal and GSE locations. The viral and archaeal reads constituted a very minute fraction of the total reads in PMA treated samples from internal and GSE locations of CRV1 and CRV2. At the phylum level (Supplementary Figure S4), the PMA treated samples showed significant differences between internal and GSE locations of both CRV1 and CRV2. The CRV1 GSE was dominated by Proteobacteria (95%) while the internal locations majorly constituted of Proteobacteria (32%), Firmicutes (29%), Actinobacteria (21%), followed by Ascomycota (8%). The CRV2 GSE also showed dominance of Proteobacteria reads (53%) followed by Actinobacteria (11%), Firmicutes (10%), and Ascomycota (7%). The CRV2 internal location had a different composition as compared to the GSE at the phylum level, which was dominated by Firmicutes (40%), closely followed by Proteobacteria (32%), and Actinobacteria (16%) reads. Also, the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 showed relatively similar abundance at the phylum level except for Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota, as mentioned earlier. At the class level (Supplementary Figure S5), the PMA treated GSE samples of CRV1 were dominated by Betaproteobacteria (73%) followed by Alphaproteobacteria (11%), while the internal location was dominated in descending order by Bacilli (28%), Actinobacteria (21%), Gammaproteobacteria (18%), Alphaproteobacteria (8%), Dothideomycetes (6%), and Betaproteobacteria (4%). In the case of CRV2 PMA treated samples, the GSE showed a high abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (21%), followed by Betaproteobacteria (17%), Actinobacteria (11%), Alphaproteobacteria (10%), and Bacilli (10%). On the other hand, Bacilli (39%) dominated the internal location of CRV2 PMA treated samples, followed by Betaproteobacteria (18%), Actinobacteria (15%), and Alphaproteobacteria (8%). Additionally, significant differences were observed at the class level for the internal locations of both CRV1 and CRV2. At the order level (Supplementary Figure S6), Burkholderiales constituted more than 71% of the reads for the PMA treated samples from the GSE of CRV1, which was distantly followed by Caulobacterales (7%), and Sphingomonadales (3%). The internal location of CRV1 presented a completely different picture, with only 4% of the reads belonging to Burkholderiales, while the most dominant order was Bacillales (27%), followed by Pseudomonadales (16%), and Propionibacteriales (10%). Furthermore, reads for Caulobacterales and Sphingomonadales were detected at very low levels (<1%) from the internal location of CRV1. The PMA treated samples for CRV2 internal and GSE surfaces showed a similar trend with respect to the order level. Burkholderiales, Bacillales, Pseudomonadales, and Propionibacteriales were the dominant orders detected on both internal and GSE surfaces. However, the only difference between GSE and internal CRV2 samples was that the reads belonging to Bacillales were dominant at the internal location (36%) and Pseudomonadales was dominant for GSE (18%). At the family level (Supplementary Figure S7), large differences were observed on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 for the PMA treated samples. Reads for Oxalobacteraceae (33%), Comamonadaceae (22%), and Caulobacteraceae (6%) dominated the GSE surface of CRV1, followed by Sphingomonadaceae (3%) and Burkholderiaceae (1%). The internal location for CRV1 showed the complete opposite trend with only 4% of the reads belonging to Oxalobacteraceae family, while Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Burkholderiaceae were detected at very low levels (<1%). Instead, the CRV1 internal location was dominated by Pseudomonadaceae (15%), Bacillaceae (10%), Propionibacteriaceae (10%), and Aureobasidiaceae (5%) families. The CRV2 PMA treated samples for both internal and GSE surfaces were relatively similar at the family level, mainly belonging to Oxalobacteraceae, Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae. However, Bacillaceae was dominant on the internal surface (13%) while Oxalobacteraceae and Pseudomonadaceae were dominant on the GSE surface (12 and 11%, respectively) for the PMA treated CRV2 samples. Additionally, reads belonging to a fungal family Pleosporaceae was present in abundance at only the GSE surface (3%) of CRV2. At the genera level (Supplementary Figure S8), as observed previously for other taxon levels, the PMA treated samples of CRV1 showed large differences between the GSE and internal surfaces. Human commensal Massilia (25%), Acidovorax (15%), and Caulobacter (6%) were the most dominant genus detected at the GSE surface of CRV1. However, reads for the genus Acidovorax, and Caulobacter were only detected at low levels (<1%) from the internal location of CRV1 and Massilia constituted only 3% of the total reads. The internal location of CRV1 was instead dominated by the bacterial genera Pseudomonas (15%) and Bacillus (9%), and the fungal genus Aureobasidium (5%). On the other hand, both the GSE and internal surfaces of CRV2 presented a relatively similar pattern of genera, including Massilia, Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Caulobacter. Abundances of these genera were different between the GSE and internal surfaces, with Pseudomonas (11%) and Massilia (8%) being dominant on the GSE surface, while the internal surface showed an abundance of Bacillus (12%), Massilia (7%), and Acidovorax (2%). At the species level (Figure 2), PMA treated samples for the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 presented a clear distinction in terms of species abundance. Caulobacter vibrioides is the only microbial species detected in abundance (3%) on the GSE surface of CRV1. The internal location, however, showed a completely different trend with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most abundant member, comprising 5% of total microbial abundance, followed by Bacillus firmus (4%), Massilia timonae (2%), Lentzea waywayandensis (1%), and the fungus Aureobasidium melanogenum (1%). The CRV2 PMA treated samples for the internal location showed the presence of Bacillus firmus (5%), Cutibacterium acnes (1%), and Lentzea waywayandensis (1%). In the sample collected from the GSE surface of CRV2, Pseudomonas stutzeri (2%), Bacillus firmus (1%), Cutibacterium acnes (1%), and Lentzea waywayandensis (1%) were present at the outside location of CRV2 samples. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Relative abundance of species based on shotgun metagenomic reads generated from PMA treated samples collected from three sampling events on the ISS and the internal (I) and ground support equipment (G) surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. Statistical Significance To determine the differences at various taxon levels between the PMA treated and untreated samples from the GSE and internal surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2, several statistical analyses were performed. Based on the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon statistics (Supplementary Table S2), no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed at the domain and phylum levels between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples of CRV1. The class, family, order, genus, and species levels showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples for CRV1. In the case of CRV2, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed at the domain, phylum, and class levels between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples although, family, order, genus, and species levels were significantly different (p < 0.05). Similar results were also seen for the PMA untreated samples, except for the CRV2 samples where phylum and class also showed significant difference (p = 0.0077 and p = 0.0004, respectively) between the internal and GSE surfaces. On comparing the PMA treated samples at internal locations between the CRV1 and CRV2, the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon statistics failed to detect any differences at the domain, class, and species level (p > 0.05), with phylum, order, family, and genera level being significantly different (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the untreated samples were significantly different (p < 0.05) between CRV1 and CRV2 at the internal locations except for the domain and species level (p = 0.1353 and p = 0.0918, respectively). The PMA treated as well as untreated samples for the GSE surfaces were significantly different (p < 0.05) for all taxon levels at the CRV1 and CRV2, except for the domain and phylum level (p = 0.0647 and p = 0.2069, respectively). Subsequently, to measure the diversity in the microbial communities residing on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, various statistical indices were used (Figures 3A–C). The Shannon–Weaver index H values for the PMA treated samples were consistently lower than the PMA untreated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. The H values can thus be interpreted as an increase in the species richness and evenness of the untreated samples as compared to the PMA treated samples. In the case of CRV1, the internal surface showed higher H values compared to the GSE surface (both PMA treated and untreated) thus indicating high species richness at the internal location. However, a completely opposite trend was observed for CRV2 where the GSE surface showed higher species richness and evenness as compared to the internal surface. A similar comparison made between the H values of the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 PMA treated samples showed that the CRV2 had higher species richness as compared to CRV1. Diversity analysis carried out using the Simpson index further confirmed the Shannon–Weaver index findings. Another diversity index, the c index, showed that the species diversity increased for the PMA untreated samples as compared to that of the PMA treated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. Similarly, in the case of CRV2, the untreated samples showed more species diversity compared to PMA treated on both internal and GSE surfaces. Additionally, the comparison of PMA treated samples at internal locations of CRV2 and CRV1 showed that the CRV2 had more species diversity as compared to the CRV1. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Relative abundance of metagenomic reads associated with (A) microbial metabolism and (B) virulence. Metagenomic reads were generated from PMA treated samples collected from three sampling events on the ISS and the internal (I) and ground support equipment (G) surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. Functional Genes Reads associated with metabolic functions like amino acid derivatives, carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamin metabolism, and protein metabolism were most abundant and relatively equally distributed for all the PMA treated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 as shown in the (Figure 3A). However, genes corresponding to other important functions like membrane transport, DNA and RNA metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, cell wall synthesis, and metabolism of aromatic compounds showed major differences between the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, and were statistically significant (Supplementary Table S2, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the MWW analysis (Supplementary Table S2) showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 as well as the GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. Virulence Genes The metagenome reads for internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 were also subjected to virulence gene analyses using the virulence factors from the SEED database as reference. A major fraction of the virulence genes belonged to multiple drug resistance (MDR) efflux pump, Legionella pneumophila potential resistome, and Cobalt-Zinc-Cadmium resistance genes as shown in Figure 3B. Furthermore, these genes showed relatively equal distribution on both internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. The relative abundance of the reads associated with virulence factors were vastly different on the internal location as compared to the GSE surfaces for both CRV1 and CRV2, and were statistically significant (Supplementary Table S2, p < 0.05). The MWW method (Supplementary Table S2) additionally showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 as well as the GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 (p = 0.05). Antimicrobial Resistance Metagenomic reads of PMA treated samples of internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 were screened for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Based on the percent abundance, the AMR genes were sorted into different categories as shown in (Figure 4). Beta-lactam resistance, Cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance, and Vancomycin resistance together comprised a major fraction of the reads belonging to AMR genes and were also relatively equally distributed across internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. The remaining half of the AMR genes were mainly comprised of penicillin binding protein, multidrug efflux pump, and serine protease genes. Importantly, except for the MDR efflux pump there was no overlap between the virulence and AMR genes. Therefore, an independent analysis was performed for AMR and virulence genes. FIGURE 4.

Comparative Analyses of ISS and CRV Microbial Diversity Two bacterial species and one fungal species that were isolated during this study of CRV surfaces (Supplementary Table S1) were also isolated from the ISS surfaces by Checinska Sielaff et al. (2019). Strains of the common skin commensal bacterium and opportunistic pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermidis, were isolated from CRV (N = 3) and ISS (N = 6) surfaces. Strains of Micrococcus yunnanensis, a bacterium previously detected within plant roots (Zhao et al., 2009), were isolated from CRV (N = 5) and ISS (N = 1) surfaces. Strains of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a common environmental saprophytic yeast and opportunistic pathogen, were also isolated from CRV (N = 1) and ISS (N = 33) surfaces. The other 45 bacterial species and 19 fungal species isolated from CRV surfaces were not isolated from ISS surfaces. Eight bacterial species and one fungal species were detected in both ISS and CRV microbiome samples, including human commensal and environmental microbes. Cutibacterium acnes, a common skin commensal, could be detected at low levels in ISS samples (<2%) and CRV samples (<1%). Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common nosocomial pathogen, could be detected at varying levels in ISS samples (0–7%) but at very low levels in CRV samples (≤0.1%). Similarly, Staphylococcus aureus, a common commensal bacterium also known to be an opportunistic pathogen, was detected at varying levels in ISS samples (0–3%) but at very low levels in CRV samples (≤0.1%, Figure 5). Streptococcus pneumoniae, another common commensal bacterium that is also an opportunistic pathogen, was detected at low abundance in ISS and CRV microbiome samples (<1% and <0.2%, respectively). Methylobacterium sp. ME121, an environmental bacterium, could be detected at low levels in ISS samples (<1%) and very low levels in CRV samples (<0.1%). Sphingobium yanoikuyae, an environmental bacterium known to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was detected at very low abundance in ISS samples (<0.1%) and low abundance in CRV samples (<0.2%). Environmental bacteria Sphingomonas sp. Ag1 and Sphingomonas sp. OV641 were also detected at very low abundance in ISS (<0.2%) and CRV (<0.3%) microbiome samples. Rhodotorula sp. JG-1b, a psychrophilic fungus, was detected at varying levels in the ISS microbiome samples (0–40%), but at very-low levels in CRV samples (<0.01%). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Relative abundance of potential opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms detected in metagenomes generated from PMA treated samples collected from the internal (I) and ground support equipment (G) surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 and three sampling events on the ISS.Although there was some overlap in species detected among ISS and CRV samples, the vast number of species detected did not overlap (309 and 111 species, respectively). Microbial species indices as calculated by Chao1 (Figure 6A), Shannon (Figure 6B), and Simpson (Figure 6C) also supported that microbial diversity was different between CRV and ISS environmental surface samples. When the overall abundance of species detected in each sample is visualized in an NMDS ordination (Figure 6D), this relationship becomes apparent. The microbiomes sampled in the ISS (red, blue, and green glyphs) cluster separately in the ordination from the microbiomes sampled in CRV1 (purple glyphs) and CRV2 (orange glyphs). The MWW test showed a significant difference in species abundance between CRV and ISS samples (W = 246120, p-value = 0.000162). Significant differences between ISS and CRV microbiomes could also be detected in genes associated with virulence (W = 4308.5, p-value = 1.443e-07) and AMR (W = 30626, p-value < 2.2e-16). However, no significant difference could be detected in genes associated with metabolism between the ISS and CRV (W = 1210, p-value = 0.4271). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Chao1 (A), Shannon (B), Simpson (C), and NMDS (D) plots representing the differences in the microbial diversity detected from metagenomes generated from PMA treated samples collected from the internal (I) and ground support equipment (GSE) surfaces of CRV1, CRV2 and the locations from three sampling events of the ISS.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The current study aims at understanding the source of contamination of the ISS by characterizing the microbial diversity of the CRV just before launching. The ISS’s robotic Canadarm appendage captures CRV carrying payloads for the ISS crew, after the CRV reaches the orbit of the ISS. As a result, in the current study, we compare the microbial diversity of the CRV with that of the previously reported ISS microbiome (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Most of the CRV cultivable isolates were already reported from samples collected from SAF cleanroom environments (Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2013), with the exception of Compostimonas. Most of these CRV isolates have been identified as species normally associated with soils, whereas cultivable microorganisms from the ISS were primarily associated with humans (Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae) with the exception of Bacillus that was common in both CRV and ISS (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). When culturable fungi were compared, most of the CRV fungal members were also present in the ISS (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). However, strain specific similarities of these fungal isolates will need to be carried out via a sophisticated strain-tracking molecular method in the future. The CRV isolates that pose a potential health risk for astronauts that may be immunocompromised are Staphylococcus pasteuri (e.g., bacteraemia) (Savini et al., 2009), Exophiala xenobiotica (e.g., phaeohyphomycosis) (Aoyama et al., 2009), and Phialemonium dimorphosporum (e.g., fungemia) (Guarro et al., 1999). The cultivable strains also included members of the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus, which are often encountered in SAF environments and can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., desiccation, low nutrients, and radiation) because of their spore formation ability (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). In addition, Bacillus and Sphingomonas are also known to form biofilms, which may increase various resistance capabilities of these microorganisms, and therefore also lead to an increased contamination risk (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The metagenome sequence analysis of the GSE and internal surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 grouped separately when compared with the eight locations from the ISS environment sampled during three flights from a previously reported study by Singh et al. (2018) (Figure 6). Furthermore, the microbiome profiles of the internal CRV were different from GSE of the CRV. The PMA treated samples collected from the GSE surface of the CRV1 were dominated by reads belonging to genera Acidovorax, Caulobacter, and Massilia (reclassified as Naxibacter), while the CRV2 GSE surface showed Pseudomonas and Bacillus. These bacteria are known to survive extreme oligotrophic conditions for extended time periods (Wilhelm, 2018; Gray et al., 2019). Additionally, the members of the aforementioned genera are known to tolerate alkaline (Yumoto et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2005) and oxidative stress conditions (Lan et al., 2010), and survive high levels of ultraviolet radiation (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Similarly, routine maintenance and cleaning procedures could presumably have removed most of the bacterial taxa associated with the SAF cleanrooms, however, spore-forming bacteria and members of Actinobacteria and Massilia persist in these environments (Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Mahnert et al., 2015). The PMA treated samples collected from the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 were dominated by Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Propionibacteriaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae, and were different from the ISS microbiome which was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Aspergillaceae, and Sporidiobolaceae. Furthermore, the CRV microbiomes showed similarities with the SAF microbiome (Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Mahnert et al., 2015). The species level comparison between the ISS and CRV microbiomes (cut off value of minimum 10 reads) showed that only nine microorganisms were common between the two ecosystems. Except for Methylobacterium, all other microbes were common skin commensals (e.g., Cutibacterium acnes, Enterobacter cloacae, Malassezia globosa, Propionibacterium humerusii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Additionally, the CRV also showed the presence of the members of genera belonging to different ecosystems (indoor to aquatic environments), like Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Massilia, Leifsonia, Corynebacterium, Caulobacter, Bacillus, Acidovorax, and Aureobasidium. It is also interesting to note that some of the microorganisms that were cultured were not detected in a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. This might be due to the fact that ITS-based identification of fungi was not always ideal in determining the species accurately. Further research on the WGS of cultured microorganisms would reveal the authentic identification. In general, most of the species observed in the CRV microbiome could not be observed in the ISS microbiome, potentially because the ISS has a consistent human presence. On the other hand, although the CRV assembly facility has constant human traffic, the cleanrooms are continuously undergoing cleaning and maintenance procedures. It is also important to note that cleaning aboard the ISS occurs sporadically and mainly during the weekend. Whereas daily stringent cleaning regiment occurs inside the CRV assembly facility to maintain a low biomass. Additionally, chemical used to clean inside the CRV are based on wipes with 3% hydrogen peroxide, whereas aboard the ISS the crew use wipes with 0.1% dimethyl ammonium chloride derivatives. Difference seen between the CRV sampled could be also due to differences in the time of the year the samples were collected. Furthermore, it is important to note that cleaning within the CRV1 was done 24 h prior to sampling. Whereas for CRV2 and CRV3, it was done the day of the sampling event and for the latter just prior to our arrival. Another potential reason for the absence of CRV microbiome in the ISS microbiome would be the limitations of the sequencing procedures. Being dominated by the human microbiome, sequences of rare or extremely low abundance microorganisms may not be detected in the ISS microbiome. Therefore, even though a certain low number of microorganisms are carried via CRV to the ISS, most of them will be outcompeted by the existing ISS microbiome, potentially rendering them undetectable in both traditional microbiology assays and state-of-the-art metagenome sequencing. The limitations of this study are related to the extremely low biomass of the CRV samples collected. When examining metagenome positive samples, it is apparent that they harbor more cultivable bacteria and fungi which might require appropriate cultivation conditions. In conclusion, this is the first report that demonstrates, using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular techniques, that there is a very little risk of transferring microorganisms to the ISS owing to CRV transport. Significant differences were shown between the ISS and the CRV microbiomes using statistical methods.

Copyright notice ID: 7677455 PMID: 33240227 Abstract Background With increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions.Results Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes and members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome.Conclusions The metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.Keywords: forward contamination, microbial diversity, commercial resupply vehicle, viability, International Space StationIntroduction Spacefaring nations carrying out interplanetary missions are subject to rules and regulations that were designed and instigated by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1967 (COSPAR, 2011). Protocols for cleaning and sterilization are of the highest priority and are regularly practiced and meticulously followed during spacecraft assembly for various missions (Benardini et al., 2014). Cleanrooms are where various spacecraft subsystems, including commercial resupply vehicles (CRV) transporting cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), are assembled. These cleanrooms undergo daily cleaning procedures, including vacuuming and mopping of floors with 70% Isopropanol, high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) air filtration, regular replacement of sticky mats at the entrance, and strict gowning procedures. Utmost care is taken by personal entering these facilities, as they are required to put on face masks, gloves, bodysuits, shoe covers, cleanroom boots, and cover hair and beards with nets (Benardini et al., 2014). These precautionary measures are a part of routine exercises, because humans are the primary source of microbial contamination (Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2015; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). On average, humans shed 1.5 million skin cells an hour which carry approximately 15 million bacterial cells, thus becoming a significant source of the indoor microbiome (Jaffal et al., 1997; Lax et al., 2014). Many reports showed transfer of microorganisms via direct contact to indoor surfaces like keyboards (Fierer et al., 2010), restrooms (Flores et al., 2011), offices (Hewitt et al., 2012), kitchens (Flores et al., 2013), airplanes (McManus and Kelley, 2005; Korves et al., 2013), and hospitals (Kembel et al., 2012; Lax et al., 2017). Because of the human presence in these cleanrooms, their surfaces are not expected to be free of microbial burden. The ISS and CRV assembly cleanrooms, including spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) environments, are strictly controlled and monitored for airflow, water circulation, temperature, and humidity; however, individual differences do exist between the two systems (Checinska et al., 2015). The ISS is a closed system where the air is recirculated after purification, while cleanrooms get a constant supply of fresh air from the outside environment. Additionally, astronauts live and work on the ISS as humans do in a typical household on Earth, while SAF cleanrooms have strict requirements that avoid activities like eating or sleeping. At a given point in time, the ISS harbors around six astronauts with a maximum of around 13 crew, while approximately 50 people can work in a cleanroom every day in a highly regulated manner. Despite high human traffic in SAF, the microbial burden was minimal and ranged between 102 and 104 cells per m2 (Hendrickson et al., 2017). It has also been shown that the cleaning procedures followed at SAF significantly decreased the number of microorganisms, but these procedures led to the selection of hardy, robust microorganisms capable of surviving extreme oligotrophic conditions (Gioia et al., 2007; Vaishampayan et al., 2012; Mahnert et al., 2015). Cargos such as food and equipment for scientific experiments are assembled in clean conditions and delivered to the ISS via CRV. All spacefaring nations impose cleanroom requirements when packaging their cargos that are resupplying the ISS. The objective of this study is to decipher the role of CRV systems in potentially transporting microorganisms to the ISS to understand if CRV could be a source of microbial contamination of the ISS. Sampling of various surfaces of CRV systems (CRV1, CRV2, and CRV3) was carried out prior to launch (∼1 month) and corresponding in-flight sampling of the ISS (Flight 1, Flight 2, and Flight 3) was designed to be within 25–51 days after docking of the respective CRV systems (see Figure 1 for a timeline). This sampling scheme was implemented to help understand whether CRV1 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 1, whether CRV2 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 2, or whether CRV3 had any influence on the microbial population of ISS Flight 3. Microbial burden associated with CRV environmental surface samples were estimated using traditional techniques (e.g., colony counts), and molecular techniques like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay and 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (fungi) quantification using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. In addition to characterizing cultivable microbial diversity using the Sanger sequencing method, the CRV samples were more thoroughly analyzed using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. Subsequently, the microbial diversity of the CRV samples was compared with the ISS environmental microbiome (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019) to understand the potential transfer of biological materials from Earth to the ISS.

Pictures: NASA/ESA Credit.Materials and Methods In this study, internal surfaces and external ground support equipment (GSE) of three CRV destined to the ISS were sampled (N = 22 and 3 controls; Table 1). Samples collected aboard the ISS were done during the berthing period of their respective vehicles, except for CRV1 (see Figure 1 for a timeline) (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Eight samples were collected in 2014 for CRV1, nine in 2015 for CRV2, and eight in 2016 for CRV3. Since CRV3 vehicle surfaces were extremely clean and all analyses, including traditional microbiology assays, were below detection limits, data pertaining to CRV3 vehicle locations are not presented in this study. Since CRV were not reused during this study, we could not sample from the same capsule multiple times. Efforts were taken to collect samples as close together as possible in subsequent CRV, but due to differences in configuration of each vehicle, it was not always possible to collect samples from the same locations. All CRV sampled were manufactured by the same vendor. TABLE 1. Descriptions of sampling locations on commercial resupply vehicles.

CRV, commercial resupply vehicle; GSE, ground support equipment.Sampling kits were assembled as detailed in our previous ISS studies (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020) to facilitate comparisons between these datasets. Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ, United States) was soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 30 min followed by transfer to a sterile zip lock bag (Venkateswaran et al., 2012). Several locations were sampled on CRV surfaces using polyester wipes, and descriptions of the locations are summarized in Table 1. A single wipe was used for each location by donning sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) to collect a sample of one-meter square area. The samples were stored at 4°C and shipped to Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA, United States) for processing. Microbiological analyses were carried out within 48 h of sampling at JPL. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each CRV sampling session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the sampling location and brought back to JPL along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. If field controls (wipes that were exposed to the CRV environment but not used in active sampling) showed any signs of microbial growth, then negative controls would be assayed for cultivable counts to check sterility of the wipes used for sampling. However, none of the field controls showed any colony forming units (CFU) for all CRV sampling events. Sample Collection and Processing Samples from CRV were processed in the same way as ISS samples from our previous studies (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). Briefly, each wipe was transferred to an individual 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) and vigorously hand shaken for 2 min. The resulting suspension was then concentrated to 4 mL using a CP-150 concentration pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO, United States). Both negative and field controls used in this study were processed the same way as other samples for comparison. The concentrated sample (4 mL) were further aliquoted to four different parts for shotgun metagenome analysis (2 × 1.5 mL; PMA treated and untreated), ATP analysis (900 μL), and for growing microorganisms (100 μL). Due to the measurement of different kinds of microorganisms, that require multiple culture media (3 types) in duplicates, the aliquots kept for growing microorganisms were further diluted (10–1 and 10–2) and used.Culture Based Microbial Diversity Due to proprietary cleaning regimes, the surfaces of CRV might be oligotrophic. Although most nutrient and carbon sources necessary for microbial growth are presumably lacking or at very-low concentrations, these surfaces may still harbor microorganisms that are either dormant or slowly metabolizing. Furthermore, microorganisms adapted to more stringent conditions may not necessarily grow on normal nutrient media. Therefore, to target the slow-growing microbial population, Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A; Difco, MI, United States) media (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985) was used. Similarly, as humans are always near the CRV during the assembly and packaging processes, potential opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms may transfer to the CRV surfaces. As a result, the CRV samples were also plated on blood agar media (BA; Difco, MI, United States) to decipher the potentially pathogenic microbial population. Additionally, the samples were also plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, MI, United States) medium, thus targeting the fungal population on CRV. To estimate the bacterial and fungal populations, the concentrated sample was diluted to a suitable serial 10-fold dilution in sterile PBS. A volume of 100 μl of suspension from the serially diluted sample was spread onto R2A media plates and PDA plates with chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), incubated at 25°C for 7 days for bacterial and fungal population enumeration, respectively. For enumeration of human commensal microorganisms, 100 μl of serially diluted sample was also spread onto BA and incubated at 35°C for 2 days. Distinct isolated colonies were transferred to fresh media and subsequently archived in semi-solid R2A media (dilution 1:10) and stored at room temperature.Strain Identification Bacterial isolates were identified by amplifying partial 16S rRNA genes using the primers 9bF (5′- GRGTTTGATCCTGG CTCAG-3′) (Huber et al., 2002) and 1406uR (5′- ACGGG CGGTGTGTRCAA-3′) (Lane, 1991) and the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 10 cycles of denaturing at 96°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 60 s, followed by another 25 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 60 s and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. The template was either a small fraction of a picked colony in a colony-PCR assay or 5–20 ng of DNA purified from culture via the peqGOLD Bacterial DNA Kit (peqlab, Germany). The 16S rRNA gene amplicons were Sanger-sequenced (Eurofins, Germany) and the obtained sequences were classified using the EzTaxon identification service (Yoon et al., 2017). Fungal isolates were identified by amplifying their ITS region using the primers ITS1F (5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGG AAGTAA-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (Manter and Vivanco, 2007) at the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 60 s, annealing at 51°C for 60 s, elongation at 72°C for 60 s, and a final elongation step at 72°C for 8 min. The amplicons were Sanger-sequenced (Eurofins, Germany) and the obtained sequences were classified using the curated databases UNITE version 7.2 (Kõljalg et al., 2013) and BOLD version 4 (Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013).Molecular Methods for Quantitation of Total and Viable Microorganisms ATP Assay To determine the total and intracellular ATP from all samples, a bioluminescence assay was performed using the CheckLite HS Kit (Kikkoman, Japan) and the manufacturer’s protocol, as described previously (Venkateswaran et al., 2003). For total ATP assay (dead and viable microbes), four replicates of 100 μl sample were mixed with 100 μl of benzalkonium chloride, a cell lysing reagent and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. To this mixture, 100 μl of luciferin-luciferase reagent was added, and the resulting bioluminescence was measured immediately using a Lumitester K-210 luminometer (Kikkoman, Japan). For intracellular ATP (viable microorganisms), 500 μl of the serially diluted sample was amended with a 50 μl of an ATP-eliminating reagent (apyrase, adenosine deaminase) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature for eliminating extracellular ATP. Following which, the ATP assay was performed as described previously for the total ATP. It has been reported that one relative luminescent unit (RLU), the unit of measurement of ATP, was considered equivalent to approximately one CFU (La Duc et al., 2004).PMA-Viability Assay Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps (Nocker et al., 2007). Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) (Nocker et al., 2006, 2007). It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells (Lin et al., 2011; Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Checinska et al., 2015; Jäger et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Avila-Herrera et al., 2020). A 3 mL aliquot of the concentrated sample was split into two halves. One 1.5 mL aliquot was treated with PMA (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States) to a final concentration of 25 μM, followed by 5 min incubation in the dark at room temperature. The sample was then exposed to photoactivation for 15 min in a PMA-Lite LED Photolysis Device (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States). The other aliquot with no PMA treatment was also incubated in dark for 5 min followed by photoactivation for 15 min like the PMA treated aliquot. Both PMA treated and untreated samples were then each split into half again. One half (750 μl) of each sample was then transferred to Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, United States) and subjected to bead beating for 60 s to allow cell disruption of hardy cells and spores with a limited loss of microbial diversity. The mechanically disrupted sample was then mixed with the unprocessed counterpart and used for DNA extraction via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, United States), per the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was extracted in 50 μl volume and stored at −20°C until further processing.Quantitative PCR Assay Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, targeting the 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi), were performed in triplicate with a SmartCycler (Cepheid, CA, United States) to quantify the bacterial and fungal burden. The following primers were used for targeting the 16S rRNA gene: 1369F (5′-CGGTGAATACGTTCYCGG-3′) and modified 1492R (5′-GGWTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) were used for this analysis (Suzuki et al., 2000). Primers targeting the ITS region, were NS91 (5′-GTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACAC-3′) and ITS51 (5′-ACCTTGTTACGACTTTTACTTCCTC-3′) (Onofri et al., 2012). Each 25 μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), and 1 μL of template DNA. Purified DNA from Model Microbial Consortium (Kwan et al., 2011) served as the positive control and DNase/RNase free molecular-grade distilled water (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) was used as the negative control. These controls were included in all qPCR runs. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 3 min denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, and combined annealing and extension at 55°C for 35 s. The number of gene copies were determined from the standard curve. The 16S rRNA gene of Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 and the ITS region of Aureobasidium pullulans 28v1 were synthesized and used for preparing standard curves as described previously (Checinska et al., 2015). The qPCR efficiency was ∼98% for each run. Negative controls yielded similar values (∼100 copies) despite using either 1 or 10 μL of DNA templates.Metagenome Sequencing DNA extracted from all CRV samples was quantified using the Qubit® Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, United States) and samples were selected based on the minimum DNA concentration requirement (∼10 pg/μL) for metagenome sequencing. Only two samples from CRV1 and two samples from CRV2, with and without PMA treatment, satisfied this cutoff, resulting in 8 samples proceeding to metagenomics sequencing (2 CRV × 2 samples × 2 treatments = 8). Sample preparation for metagenome sequencing was carried out using the Illumina Nextera Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Each library was assessed for quality and fragment size using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States). Adapters were added and ligated to DNA sequences in each library. All libraries were then normalized to 2 mM, pooled together and subjected to denaturation followed by dilution to 1.8 pM concentration, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was carried out using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) resulting in 100 bp paired end reads.Data Processing Adapter sequences and low-quality ends were trimmed from the 100 bp paired end reads using Trimmomatic (version 0.32) (Bolger et al., 2014) with a quality cutoff value set at minimum Phred score of 20 along the entire read length. Additionally, reads shorter than 80 bp were removed, followed by data normalization based on guidelines provided by Nayfach and Pollard (2016). Using the MEGAN 6 lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm (Huson et al., 2016), filtered high quality reads were binned to their respective domain and normalized for semi-quantitative comparative analysis. Assigning taxonomy and function to the filtered CRV metagenome sequences was performed using the MEGAN 6 tool kit (Huson et al., 2016). We used the  taxonomy database (Sayers et al., 2008) and -NR protein sequence database with entries from GenPept, SwissProt, PIR, PDB, and RefSeq, to assign taxonomic features to sequences using the sequence comparison tool DIAMOND (version 0.8.29). Assignments were based on the weighted LCA assignment algorithm of MEGAN 6 (Huson et al., 2007). Additionally, filtered DNA sequences were mapped against protein databases like eggnog (Powell et al., 2011), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), and SEED (Overbeek et al., 2005) for functional analysis.Comparison of CRV and ISS Metagenomes Metagenome data from a previously reported study (Singh et al., 2018) of samples collected from the ISS were analyzed in tandem with metagenome data for samples collected from the CRV. These ISS metagenome samples were collected shortly after unberthing of CRV1 from the station or while CRV2 was berthed to the station (see Figure 1 for a timeline). Analyzing ISS and CRV metagenomes together allowed us to focus on microbial dynamics associated with the transfer of materials from CRV to the ISS. Microbial diversity analyses performed on normalized reads were designed to retain a minimum of one unique sequence to avoid the loss of low depth samples or unique sequences. Furthermore, BLAST hits of ≥20 amino acids and ≥90% nucleotide identity were used for taxonomic and functional studies. Normalized read counts for each sample at multiple taxonomic levels (e.g., domain, family, species, etc.) were exported in matrix form from MEGAN 6 and used in downstream statistical analyses.Statistical Analyses To determine the differences in samples collected from the GSE and internal surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 and to compare them with samples collected from the ISS, several statistical analyses were performed. The non-parametric Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test was used to evaluate differences in microbial diversity detected on internal surfaces of CRV and surfaces of their GSE, across CRV sampling events, and with samples collected from the ISS surfaces. The null hypothesis for the MWW test is that the distributions of microorganisms are equal between two conditions tested (e.g., internal or GSE surface), or alternatively these distributions are not equal. Parametric tests were considered for this purpose, but transformation of these data to satisfy assumptions of these tests was not practical. Samples below detection limit were assumed to have a value of 0.01 for all statistical analyses. These analyses were performed using a custom R script1. To measure the diversity in the microbial communities residing on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, various statistical indices were used, including the Shannon–Weaver index (Shannon and Weaver, 1949), Simpson’s index (Simpson, 1949), and the Chao1 metric (Chao, 1984). To visualize differences in relative species abundance among CRV and ISS metagenome samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated from the normalized read counts was used. Analyses were performed using the vegan R package2 and custom R scripts3 ,4.Results Microbial Burden Microbial burden assays were aimed at using both cultivation-dependent and independent methods to assess the broad diversity of microorganisms on various locations sampled from CRV1 and CRV2 (see Table 1 for a description of each sample). Since CRV3 did not show any cultivable counts, such information was not obtained. Microbial colonies were isolated from all three locations on the GSE surfaces of CRV1 (locations 1, 2, and 7), and only one internal surface (location 4) as shown in Table 2. Using the R2A media, bacteria isolated from three GSE surfaces of CRV1 ranged between 1.3 × 105 to 2.8 × 106 CFU per m2 while 1.8 × 104 CFU per m2 colonies were isolated from the internal location CRV1-L4, an order of magnitude lower than samples from GSE surfaces. The MWW test of colony counts on R2A media show that the three GSE surfaces of CRV1 harbor a significantly different number of cultivable bacteria than the internal locations (W = 12, p-value = 0.0436). No colonies were isolated from internal locations of CRV1 on BA media while GSE surfaces (location 2 and 7) showed 1 × 106 CFU per m2 and location 1 showed 5.1 × 102 CFU per m2 colonies. Fungal colonies isolated on PDA media from GSE of CRV1 ranged between 3.8 × 104 to 2.9 × 105 CFU per m2 while 2 × 104 CFU per m2 were isolated from the internal location CRV1-L4. The MWW test of colony counts on PDA media show that the three GSE surfaces of CRV1 harbor a significantly different amount of cultivable fungi than the internal surfaces (W = 12, p-value = 0.0436).

The microbial colonies isolated from the CRV2-L1 GSE location were 3.7 × 104 and internal locations of CRV2-L7 and CRV2-L8 were 3.3 × 103 and 9.5 × 102 CFU per m2, respectively on R2A media. The MWW test of colony counts on R2A media failed to show a significant difference between bacterial counts among the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8, p-value = 1.0). About 5.0 × 102 (GSE location 1) and 1.5 × 103 (internal location 7) CFU per m2 were isolated on the BA media. The MWW test of colony counts on BA media failed to show a significant difference between bacterial counts among the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8, p-value = 1.0). About 1.5 × 103 CFU per m2 of fungi were isolated from both GSE location CRV2-L1 and internal location CRV2-L7 on the PDA media. The MWW test of colony counts on PDA media failed to show a significant difference between fungal counts between the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV2 (W = 8.5, p-value = 0.8437). The microbial colony counts for the CRV2 were lower by almost an order of magnitude as compared to CRV1. However, the MWW test failed to show a significant difference in colony counts between CRV1 and CRV2 on R2A media (W = 38.5, p-value = 0.2094), BA media (W = 35, p-value = 0.3698), or PDA media (W = 41, p-value = 0.1023). Strikingly, no samples from GSE or internal surfaces of the CRV3 vehicle showed any trace of a microbial population. Identification of cultured microbes revealed the presence of four bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes; Supplementary Table S1) and two fungal phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota; Supplementary Table S1). Almost all the bacterial isolates, besides Pseudarthrobacter, Compostimonas, and Mycobacterium, have also been detected by the metagenome derived diversity analysis, at least at the genus level, whereas half of the fungal isolates (Bullera/Papiliotrema, Cryptococcus/Hannaella/Naganishia, Cladosporium, Dioszegia, Rhodotorula, Periconia, Phialemoniopsis, and Phlebia) were not detected. Cultivation-independent methods used to estimate the microbial burden included ATP and qPCR assays. The intracellular ATP assay quantified the content of live cells, and total ATP quantified both dead and live cells to provide an estimate of the viable microbial population in a given sample. In the case of CRV1, the total ATP content for the GSE surfaces ranged between 105 to 106 RLUs per m2, while all internal surface locations had ATP content lower by four orders of magnitude, except for the CRV1-L4 location which had 1.9 × 105 RLUs per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The intracellular ATP content for all GSE surfaces and one internal surface (CRV1-L4) were similar to their respective total ATP content, thus indicating that almost 100% of the microorganisms were viable at these locations. However, the intracellular ATP content was considerably lower for other internal locations of CRV1 and indicated that only 15–30% of the total microorganisms were viable. Incidentally, cultivable populations were isolated only from the CRV1-L4 sample. In the case of the CRV2, all GSE surfaces showed total ATP content of 105 RLUs per m2, except for CRV2-L2 which had only 101 RLUs per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The total ATP RLU values for all internal locations of CRV2 were similar to CRV1 with only 101 RLUs per m2. The MWW test failed to show a significant difference in total or intracellular ATP content between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 45.5, p-value = 0.3859 or W = 49, p-value = 0.2359). The intracellular ATP content for all internal locations of CRV2 was lower than the respective total ATP content thus indicating that 5–36% of the total microorganisms were viable. The qPCR-based DNA quantification using the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region provided an estimate of the bacterial and fungal burden of the CRV1 and CRV2. In the case of CRV1, the PMA treated samples (viable microbes) from the GSE sample locations had very high bacterial density for locations 2 and 7, ranging between 107–108 16S rRNA gene copies per m2 (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2A). However, location 1 (GSE) and all internal locations of CRV1 showed 105 viable bacterial population per m2. In general, the PMA treated CRV1 samples showed 16S rRNA gene copy numbers lower by one to two orders of magnitude for the intact cells from GSE locations samples, while there was an only minute difference in the intact cell population for all internal CRV surface samples. The percentage of the intact cells for both internal and GSE locations of CRV1 ranged between 40 and 64%, except for the location 2 and 6, which had 5 and 100% of the intact cells, respectively. Similarly, the fungal density estimated using quantification of the ITS region showed that the ITS gene copies in PMA untreated samples in CRV1 samples were less by three to four orders of magnitude as compared to their bacterial counterpart. The ITS copies for the PMA untreated samples ranged between 105 and 106 for the GSE locations and 104 ITS copies per m2 for internal locations (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S2B). The PMA treated samples for both internal and GSE CRV1 locations showed similar ITS copy numbers to the PMA untreated samples, thus making the percentage of intact fungal cells 90–100% for CRV1-L4 and CRV1-L7. However, the GSE location CRV1-L2 showed only 20% of the intact fungal population. In the case of CRV2, the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of PMA untreated samples for the GSE and internal locations were 105 and 104 copies per m2, respectively. The percentage of the intact bacterial cell numbers determined from the PMA treated samples for both GSE and internal locations were in the range of 36–62% and 34–100%, respectively. The fungal density for the CRV2 samples for both GSE and internal locations for the PMA untreated samples was in the range of 105 and 104, respectively. Additionally, these fungal cell numbers were higher by an order of magnitude as compared to their bacterial counterpart. The MWW test of 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of PMA treated samples showed a significant difference in bacterial abundance between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 62, p-value = 0.01408). The MWW test of ITS copy numbers of PMA treated samples, however, failed to demonstrated a significant difference in fungal abundance between CRV1 and CRV2 (W = 50, p-value = 0.107). When comparing 16S rRNA or ITS copy numbers from GSE and internal samples, the MWW test failed to find any significant difference (M = 43, p-value = 0.0675 or M = 39, p-value = 0.08197, respectively).Metagenome Derived Microbial Diversity Samples were collected from three CRV vehicles (25 samples in total; Table 1) and each wipe was either treated with PMA or left untreated, resulting in an analysis of 50 samples, including 6 controls. Among the 50 samples subjected for shotgun library preparation, only 8 samples (4 non-PMA and corresponding 4 PMA treated) yielded shotgun metagenome libraries (none from the controls) and all other 42 samples were below the detection limit (0.01 ng DNA/μL). Subsequently, these low DNA concentration samples (42 samples) did not produce any shotgun metagenome sequences. High quality metagenome reads were obtained for four samples; one each from GSE (CRV1-L2; CRV2-L1) and internal (CRV1-L4; CRV2-L7) locations. Interestingly, the microbial burden (both cultivable and qPCR assays) of these four sites were high when compared to other locations (Table 2). At the domain level, bacteria dominated the microbial diversity detected in the metagenomes sampled from internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. In the case of CRV1, bacteria at both internal (CRV1-L4) and GSE (CRV1-L2) locations constituted 99 and 88% of the total reads from PMA treated samples, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3). PMA treated samples from CRV2 were very similar to CRV1 samples when compared at the domain level, both GSE (CRV2-L1) and internal (CRV2-L7) locations were dominated by bacteria (90 and 94%, respectively). Most of the remaining reads belonged to Eukaryota, constituting <1–12% of the total reads from CRV1 and CRV2 internal and GSE locations. The viral and archaeal reads constituted a very minute fraction of the total reads in PMA treated samples from internal and GSE locations of CRV1 and CRV2. At the phylum level (Supplementary Figure S4), the PMA treated samples showed significant differences between internal and GSE locations of both CRV1 and CRV2. The CRV1 GSE was dominated by Proteobacteria (95%) while the internal locations majorly constituted of Proteobacteria (32%), Firmicutes (29%), Actinobacteria (21%), followed by Ascomycota (8%). The CRV2 GSE also showed dominance of Proteobacteria reads (53%) followed by Actinobacteria (11%), Firmicutes (10%), and Ascomycota (7%). The CRV2 internal location had a different composition as compared to the GSE at the phylum level, which was dominated by Firmicutes (40%), closely followed by Proteobacteria (32%), and Actinobacteria (16%) reads. Also, the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 showed relatively similar abundance at the phylum level except for Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota, as mentioned earlier. At the class level (Supplementary Figure S5), the PMA treated GSE samples of CRV1 were dominated by Betaproteobacteria (73%) followed by Alphaproteobacteria (11%), while the internal location was dominated in descending order by Bacilli (28%), Actinobacteria (21%), Gammaproteobacteria (18%), Alphaproteobacteria (8%), Dothideomycetes (6%), and Betaproteobacteria (4%). In the case of CRV2 PMA treated samples, the GSE showed a high abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (21%), followed by Betaproteobacteria (17%), Actinobacteria (11%), Alphaproteobacteria (10%), and Bacilli (10%). On the other hand, Bacilli (39%) dominated the internal location of CRV2 PMA treated samples, followed by Betaproteobacteria (18%), Actinobacteria (15%), and Alphaproteobacteria (8%). Additionally, significant differences were observed at the class level for the internal locations of both CRV1 and CRV2. At the order level (Supplementary Figure S6), Burkholderiales constituted more than 71% of the reads for the PMA treated samples from the GSE of CRV1, which was distantly followed by Caulobacterales (7%), and Sphingomonadales (3%). The internal location of CRV1 presented a completely different picture, with only 4% of the reads belonging to Burkholderiales, while the most dominant order was Bacillales (27%), followed by Pseudomonadales (16%), and Propionibacteriales (10%). Furthermore, reads for Caulobacterales and Sphingomonadales were detected at very low levels (<1%) from the internal location of CRV1. The PMA treated samples for CRV2 internal and GSE surfaces showed a similar trend with respect to the order level. Burkholderiales, Bacillales, Pseudomonadales, and Propionibacteriales were the dominant orders detected on both internal and GSE surfaces. However, the only difference between GSE and internal CRV2 samples was that the reads belonging to Bacillales were dominant at the internal location (36%) and Pseudomonadales was dominant for GSE (18%). At the family level (Supplementary Figure S7), large differences were observed on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 for the PMA treated samples. Reads for Oxalobacteraceae (33%), Comamonadaceae (22%), and Caulobacteraceae (6%) dominated the GSE surface of CRV1, followed by Sphingomonadaceae (3%) and Burkholderiaceae (1%). The internal location for CRV1 showed the complete opposite trend with only 4% of the reads belonging to Oxalobacteraceae family, while Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Burkholderiaceae were detected at very low levels (<1%). Instead, the CRV1 internal location was dominated by Pseudomonadaceae (15%), Bacillaceae (10%), Propionibacteriaceae (10%), and Aureobasidiaceae (5%) families. The CRV2 PMA treated samples for both internal and GSE surfaces were relatively similar at the family level, mainly belonging to Oxalobacteraceae, Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae. However, Bacillaceae was dominant on the internal surface (13%) while Oxalobacteraceae and Pseudomonadaceae were dominant on the GSE surface (12 and 11%, respectively) for the PMA treated CRV2 samples. Additionally, reads belonging to a fungal family Pleosporaceae was present in abundance at only the GSE surface (3%) of CRV2. At the genera level (Supplementary Figure S8), as observed previously for other taxon levels, the PMA treated samples of CRV1 showed large differences between the GSE and internal surfaces. Human commensal Massilia (25%), Acidovorax (15%), and Caulobacter (6%) were the most dominant genus detected at the GSE surface of CRV1. However, reads for the genus Acidovorax, and Caulobacter were only detected at low levels (<1%) from the internal location of CRV1 and Massilia constituted only 3% of the total reads. The internal location of CRV1 was instead dominated by the bacterial genera Pseudomonas (15%) and Bacillus (9%), and the fungal genus Aureobasidium (5%). On the other hand, both the GSE and internal surfaces of CRV2 presented a relatively similar pattern of genera, including Massilia, Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Caulobacter. Abundances of these genera were different between the GSE and internal surfaces, with Pseudomonas (11%) and Massilia (8%) being dominant on the GSE surface, while the internal surface showed an abundance of Bacillus (12%), Massilia (7%), and Acidovorax (2%). At the species level (Figure 2), PMA treated samples for the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 presented a clear distinction in terms of species abundance. Caulobacter vibrioides is the only microbial species detected in abundance (3%) on the GSE surface of CRV1. The internal location, however, showed a completely different trend with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most abundant member, comprising 5% of total microbial abundance, followed by Bacillus firmus (4%), Massilia timonae (2%), Lentzea waywayandensis (1%), and the fungus Aureobasidium melanogenum (1%). The CRV2 PMA treated samples for the internal location showed the presence of Bacillus firmus (5%), Cutibacterium acnes (1%), and Lentzea waywayandensis (1%). In the sample collected from the GSE surface of CRV2, Pseudomonas stutzeri (2%), Bacillus firmus (1%), Cutibacterium acnes (1%), and Lentzea waywayandensis (1%) were present at the outside location of CRV2 samples.

Based on the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon statistics (Supplementary Table S2), no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed at the domain and phylum levels between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples of CRV1. The class, family, order, genus, and species levels showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples for CRV1. In the case of CRV2, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed at the domain, phylum, and class levels between the GSE and internal surfaces of PMA treated samples although, family, order, genus, and species levels were significantly different (p < 0.05). Similar results were also seen for the PMA untreated samples, except for the CRV2 samples where phylum and class also showed significant difference (p = 0.0077 and p = 0.0004, respectively) between the internal and GSE surfaces. On comparing the PMA treated samples at internal locations between the CRV1 and CRV2, the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon statistics failed to detect any differences at the domain, class, and species level (p > 0.05), with phylum, order, family, and genera level being significantly different (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the untreated samples were significantly different (p < 0.05) between CRV1 and CRV2 at the internal locations except for the domain and species level (p = 0.1353 and p = 0.0918, respectively). The PMA treated as well as untreated samples for the GSE surfaces were significantly different (p < 0.05) for all taxon levels at the CRV1 and CRV2, except for the domain and phylum level (p = 0.0647 and p = 0.2069, respectively). Subsequently, to measure the diversity in the microbial communities residing on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, various statistical indices were used (Figures 3A–C). The Shannon–Weaver index H values for the PMA treated samples were consistently lower than the PMA untreated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. The H values can thus be interpreted as an increase in the species richness and evenness of the untreated samples as compared to the PMA treated samples. In the case of CRV1, the internal surface showed higher H values compared to the GSE surface (both PMA treated and untreated) thus indicating high species richness at the internal location. However, a completely opposite trend was observed for CRV2 where the GSE surface showed higher species richness and evenness as compared to the internal surface. A similar comparison made between the H values of the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 PMA treated samples showed that the CRV2 had higher species richness as compared to CRV1. Diversity analysis carried out using the Simpson index further confirmed the Shannon–Weaver index findings. Another diversity index, the c index, showed that the species diversity increased for the PMA untreated samples as compared to that of the PMA treated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. Similarly, in the case of CRV2, the untreated samples showed more species diversity compared to PMA treated on both internal and GSE surfaces. Additionally, the comparison of PMA treated samples at internal locations of CRV2 and CRV1 showed that the CRV2 had more species diversity as compared to the CRV1. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Relative abundance of metagenomic reads associated with (A) microbial metabolism and (B) virulence. Metagenomic reads were generated from PMA treated samples collected from three sampling events on the ISS and the internal (I) and ground support equipment (G) surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2.Functional Genes Reads associated with metabolic functions like amino acid derivatives, carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamin metabolism, and protein metabolism were most abundant and relatively equally distributed for all the PMA treated samples on the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 as shown in the (Figure 3A). However, genes corresponding to other important functions like membrane transport, DNA and RNA metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, cell wall synthesis, and metabolism of aromatic compounds showed major differences between the internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2, and were statistically significant (Supplementary Table S2, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the MWW analysis (Supplementary Table S2) showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 as well as the GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2.Virulence Genes The metagenome reads for internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2 were also subjected to virulence gene analyses using the virulence factors from the SEED database as reference. A major fraction of the virulence genes belonged to multiple drug resistance (MDR) efflux pump, Legionella pneumophila potential resistome, and Cobalt-Zinc-Cadmium resistance genes as shown in Figure 3B. Furthermore, these genes showed relatively equal distribution on both internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2. The relative abundance of the reads associated with virulence factors were vastly different on the internal location as compared to the GSE surfaces for both CRV1 and CRV2, and were statistically significant (Supplementary Table S2, p < 0.05). The MWW method (Supplementary Table S2) additionally showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 as well as the GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 (p = 0.05).Antimicrobial Resistance Metagenomic reads of PMA treated samples of internal and GSE surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 were screened for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Based on the percent abundance, the AMR genes were sorted into different categories as shown in (Figure 4). Beta-lactam resistance, Cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance, and Vancomycin resistance together comprised a major fraction of the reads belonging to AMR genes and were also relatively equally distributed across internal and GSE surfaces of both CRV1 and CRV2. The remaining half of the AMR genes were mainly comprised of penicillin binding protein, multidrug efflux pump, and serine protease genes. Importantly, except for the MDR efflux pump there was no overlap between the virulence and AMR genes. Therefore, an independent analysis was performed for AMR and virulence genes. FIGURE 4.

(2019). Strains of the common skin commensal bacterium and opportunistic pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermidis, were isolated from CRV (N = 3) and ISS (N = 6) surfaces. Strains of Micrococcus yunnanensis, a bacterium previously detected within plant roots (Zhao et al., 2009), were isolated from CRV (N = 5) and ISS (N = 1) surfaces. Strains of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a common environmental saprophytic yeast and opportunistic pathogen, were also isolated from CRV (N = 1) and ISS (N = 33) surfaces. The other 45 bacterial species and 19 fungal species isolated from CRV surfaces were not isolated from ISS surfaces. Eight bacterial species and one fungal species were detected in both ISS and CRV microbiome samples, including human commensal and environmental microbes. Cutibacterium acnes, a common skin commensal, could be detected at low levels in ISS samples (<2%) and CRV samples (<1%). Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common nosocomial pathogen, could be detected at varying levels in ISS samples (0–7%) but at very low levels in CRV samples (≤0.1%). Similarly, Staphylococcus aureus, a common commensal bacterium also known to be an opportunistic pathogen, was detected at varying levels in ISS samples (0–3%) but at very low levels in CRV samples (≤0.1%, Figure 5). Streptococcus pneumoniae, another common commensal bacterium that is also an opportunistic pathogen, was detected at low abundance in ISS and CRV microbiome samples (<1% and <0.2%, respectively). Methylobacterium sp. ME121, an environmental bacterium, could be detected at low levels in ISS samples (<1%) and very low levels in CRV samples (<0.1%). Sphingobium yanoikuyae, an environmental bacterium known to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was detected at very low abundance in ISS samples (<0.1%) and low abundance in CRV samples (<0.2%). Environmental bacteria Sphingomonas sp. Ag1 and Sphingomonas sp. OV641 were also detected at very low abundance in ISS (<0.2%) and CRV (<0.3%) microbiome samples. Rhodotorula sp. JG-1b, a psychrophilic fungus, was detected at varying levels in the ISS microbiome samples (0–40%), but at very-low levels in CRV samples (<0.01%). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Relative abundance of potential opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms detected in metagenomes generated from PMA treated samples collected from the internal (I) and ground support equipment (G) surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 and three sampling events on the ISS.Although there was some overlap in species detected among ISS and CRV samples, the vast number of species detected did not overlap (309 and 111 species, respectively). Microbial species indices as calculated by Chao1 (Figure 6A), Shannon (Figure 6B), and Simpson (Figure 6C) also supported that microbial diversity was different between CRV and ISS environmental surface samples. When the overall abundance of species detected in each sample is visualized in an NMDS ordination (Figure 6D), this relationship becomes apparent. The microbiomes sampled in the ISS (red, blue, and green glyphs) cluster separately in the ordination from the microbiomes sampled in CRV1 (purple glyphs) and CRV2 (orange glyphs). The MWW test showed a significant difference in species abundance between CRV and ISS samples (W = 246120, p-value = 0.000162). Significant differences between ISS and CRV microbiomes could also be detected in genes associated with virulence (W = 4308.5, p-value = 1.443e-07) and AMR (W = 30626, p-value < 2.2e-16). However, no significant difference could be detected in genes associated with metabolism between the ISS and CRV (W = 1210, p-value = 0.4271). FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Chao1 (A), Shannon (B), Simpson (C), and NMDS (D) plots representing the differences in the microbial diversity detected from metagenomes generated from PMA treated samples collected from the internal (I) and ground support equipment (GSE) surfaces of CRV1, CRV2 and the locations from three sampling events of the ISS.Discussion The current study aims at understanding the source of contamination of the ISS by characterizing the microbial diversity of the CRV just before launching. The ISS’s robotic Canadarm appendage captures CRV carrying payloads for the ISS crew, after the CRV reaches the orbit of the ISS. As a result, in the current study, we compare the microbial diversity of the CRV with that of the previously reported ISS microbiome (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Most of the CRV cultivable isolates were already reported from samples collected from SAF cleanroom environments (Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2013), with the exception of Compostimonas. Most of these CRV isolates have been identified as species normally associated with soils, whereas cultivable microorganisms from the ISS were primarily associated with humans (Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae) with the exception of Bacillus that was common in both CRV and ISS (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). When culturable fungi were compared, most of the CRV fungal members were also present in the ISS (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). However, strain specific similarities of these fungal isolates will need to be carried out via a sophisticated strain-tracking molecular method in the future. The CRV isolates that pose a potential health risk for astronauts that may be immunocompromised are Staphylococcus pasteuri (e.g., bacteraemia) (Savini et al., 2009), Exophiala xenobiotica (e.g., phaeohyphomycosis) (Aoyama et al., 2009), and Phialemonium dimorphosporum (e.g., fungemia) (Guarro et al., 1999). The cultivable strains also included members of the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus, which are often encountered in SAF environments and can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., desiccation, low nutrients, and radiation) because of their spore formation ability (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). In addition, Bacillus and Sphingomonas are also known to form biofilms, which may increase various resistance capabilities of these microorganisms, and therefore also lead to an increased contamination risk (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The metagenome sequence analysis of the GSE and internal surfaces of CRV1 and CRV2 grouped separately when compared with the eight locations from the ISS environment sampled during three flights from a previously reported study by Singh et al. (2018) (Figure 6). Furthermore, the microbiome profiles of the internal CRV were different from GSE of the CRV. The PMA treated samples collected from the GSE surface of the CRV1 were dominated by reads belonging to genera Acidovorax, Caulobacter, and Massilia (reclassified as Naxibacter), while the CRV2 GSE surface showed Pseudomonas and Bacillus. These bacteria are known to survive extreme oligotrophic conditions for extended time periods (Wilhelm, 2018; Gray et al., 2019). Additionally, the members of the aforementioned genera are known to tolerate alkaline (Yumoto et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2005) and oxidative stress conditions (Lan et al., 2010), and survive high levels of ultraviolet radiation (Vaishampayan et al., 2012). Similarly, routine maintenance and cleaning procedures could presumably have removed most of the bacterial taxa associated with the SAF cleanrooms, however, spore-forming bacteria and members of Actinobacteria and Massilia persist in these environments (Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Mahnert et al., 2015). The PMA treated samples collected from the internal locations of CRV1 and CRV2 were dominated by Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Propionibacteriaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae, and were different from the ISS microbiome which was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Aspergillaceae, and Sporidiobolaceae. Furthermore, the CRV microbiomes showed similarities with the SAF microbiome (Vaishampayan et al., 2013; Mahnert et al., 2015). The species level comparison between the ISS and CRV microbiomes (cut off value of minimum 10 reads) showed that only nine microorganisms were common between the two ecosystems. Except for Methylobacterium, all other microbes were common skin commensals (e.g., Cutibacterium acnes, Enterobacter cloacae, Malassezia globosa, Propionibacterium humerusii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Additionally, the CRV also showed the presence of the members of genera belonging to different ecosystems (indoor to aquatic environments), like Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Massilia, Leifsonia, Corynebacterium, Caulobacter, Bacillus, Acidovorax, and Aureobasidium. It is also interesting to note that some of the microorganisms that were cultured were not detected in a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. This might be due to the fact that ITS-based identification of fungi was not always ideal in determining the species accurately. Further research on the WGS of cultured microorganisms would reveal the authentic identification. In general, most of the species observed in the CRV microbiome could not be observed in the ISS microbiome, potentially because the ISS has a consistent human presence. On the other hand, although the CRV assembly facility has constant human traffic, the cleanrooms are continuously undergoing cleaning and maintenance procedures. It is also important to note that cleaning aboard the ISS occurs sporadically and mainly during the weekend. Whereas daily stringent cleaning regiment occurs inside the CRV assembly facility to maintain a low biomass. Additionally, chemical used to clean inside the CRV are based on wipes with 3% hydrogen peroxide, whereas aboard the ISS the crew use wipes with 0.1% dimethyl ammonium chloride derivatives. Difference seen between the CRV sampled could be also due to differences in the time of the year the samples were collected. Furthermore, it is important to note that cleaning within the CRV1 was done 24 h prior to sampling. Whereas for CRV2 and CRV3, it was done the day of the sampling event and for the latter just prior to our arrival. Another potential reason for the absence of CRV microbiome in the ISS microbiome would be the limitations of the sequencing procedures. Being dominated by the human microbiome, sequences of rare or extremely low abundance microorganisms may not be detected in the ISS microbiome. Therefore, even though a certain low number of microorganisms are carried via CRV to the ISS, most of them will be outcompeted by the existing ISS microbiome, potentially rendering them undetectable in both traditional microbiology assays and state-of-the-art metagenome sequencing. The limitations of this study are related to the extremely low biomass of the CRV samples collected. When examining metagenome positive samples, it is apparent that they harbor more cultivable bacteria and fungi which might require appropriate cultivation conditions. In conclusion, this is the first report that demonstrates, using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular techniques, that there is a very little risk of transferring microorganisms to the ISS owing to CRV transport. Significant differences were shown between the ISS and the CRV microbiomes using statistical methods. The cleaning protocols for CRV surfaces appear to be highly effective, and continued observance of these protocols is recommended to limit forward contamination of the ISS.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study can be found in online repositories.

    "abstract": "Abstract Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1−ω7c and C18:1−ω6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T). Keywords: Methylobacterium, polyphasic taxomony, ANI, international space station (ISS), whole genome sequencing",
    "introduction": "Introduction The genus Methylobacterium contains more species than any other genera within the family Methylobacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales, and class Alphaproteobacteria (Kelly et al., 2014). Methylobacterium species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The genus was first proposed by Patt et al. (1976) with Methylobacterium organophilum as the type species. The genus Methylobacterium was first emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (Patt et al., 1976). Another taxonomic study classified all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genus Methylobacterium (Green and Bousfield, 1982). Thereafter, 11 species from the genus Methylobacterium were redefined into a new genus proposed as Methylorubrum, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (Green and Ardley, 2018). The genus Methylobacterium consists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (Gallego et al.,2005a,b; Kang et al., 2007; Veyisoglu et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2014; Kwak et al., 2014; Chaudhry et al., 2016; Green and Ardley, 2018; Park et al., 2018). Methylobacterium species are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (Madhaiyan et al., 2006; Kumar M. et al., 2016; Parasuraman et al., 2019; Grossi et al., 2020; Krug et al., 2020). For instance, a novel Methylobacterium sp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (Grossi et al., 2020). Furthermore, genomic analysis of Methylobacterium sp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (Grossi et al., 2020). In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae were isolated (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Some of the Methylobacterium species that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (Kang et al., 2007; Chaudhry et al., 2016), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and define the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Methylobacterium strains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Isolation of Bacteria Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking–1 flight experiments from 2015 to 2016. Sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms were published elsewhere (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Briefly, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (Checinska et al., 2015; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25°C for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies (n = 4) isolated from three different locations and from a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and differential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW-B2T was isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location #7, the Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1-R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA filter that was returned aboard STS-134/ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (Checinska et al., 2015). DNA Extraction and Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis A biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25°C for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 platform with a paired-end module. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain, 2012) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) genome assembler (k-mer size- 32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. The genome was annotated using the  () Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 4.11 (Tatusova et al., 2016; Haft et al., 2018). In addition, functional annotation of genome and seed categories were assigned to the genome by implementing the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) tool (Aziz et al., 2008). Genomes of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from , and the genomic relatedness of ISS strains was identified based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; FastANI) calculations (Jain et al., 2018) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). FastANI was run on all the genomes using the default parameters: Mashmap identity cutoff I0 = 80%, non-overlapping fragments of size l = 3Kb, and minimum count of reciprocal mappings τ = 50. Phylogenetic Analysis Phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and MLSA using six housekeeping genes: ATP synthase F1 beta subunit (atpD), DNA strand exchange and recombination gene (recA), chaperone gene (dnaK), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), glutamine synthetase type I (glnI), and DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), for differentiating Methylobacterium species (Green and Ardley, 2018). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all 45 Methylobacterium species were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, representative species of genus Methylorubrum, Enterovirga, Microvirga, and Neomegalonema from family Methylobacteriaceae, Rhizobium from order Rhizobiales, Caulobacter from order Caulobacterales, in class Alphaproteobacteria were included. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was selected as the outgroup. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains were retrieved from  except for the four ISS strains, which were recovered from their respective WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes and MLSA was carried out with type strains of 24 Methylobacterium species and representative species of other genera. All the gene sequences were retrieved from the genome sequences using RAST v2.01 (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014; Brettin et al., 2015). The individual gene sequences for all strains were aligned separately using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). For MLSA, six housekeeping gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually and aligned using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). The genome-based tree for the Methylobacterium species, including ISS strains and representative species of other genus with available WGS, was constructed using GToTree (Lee, 2019). This tool takes the complete/draft genomes as input and creates a phylogenomic tree based on the prespecified single-copy gene set using a hidden Markov model (HMM); the tool currently has 2,044 unique HMM set as identifiers to cover all three domains of microbial life. Phenotypic Characterization of ISS Strains Phenotypic characterization was performed according to standard protocols (Jones, 1981). Growth of the ISS strains at different temperatures (7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C) was assessed after incubation on nutrient agar (Sigma, United States) for 7 days. Growth at different pH (4.0–10.0 at intervals of 1.0) was assessed after incubation in nutrient broth (Sigma, United States) at 30°C for 7 days. The pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted using citrate/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 4.0–5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0), and tris buffer (pH 9.0–10.0) (Kim et al., 2019). Salt tolerance was tested by streaking the strains on R2A supplemented with NaCl (0–10% at intervals of 1%) and incubating the plates at 30°C for 7 days. Motility was assessed via the “hanging drop” method by observing the culture under a light microscope (Tindall et al., 2007). Catalase activity was tested by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide to culture grown on R2A at 30°C for 7 days, and effervescence was monitored (Tindall et al., 2007). An oxidase test was carried out in a filter paper soaked with the substrate tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and coloration was documented (Jurtshuk Jr. and McQuitty, 1976). All other physiological and biochemical tests were carried out using API 20 NE, API 50 CH, and API ZYM kits as per manufacturer’s procedures (bioMérieux, France). Chemotaxonomic Analysis All strains grown in the R2A broth were harvested when growth of the cultures reached around 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase), and then the cultures were used for analyses of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which were carried out as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Briefly, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cell pellet from each strain was subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with Sherlock MIS software (Microbial ID; MIDI 6.0 version; Agilent: 6850)2. The peaks obtained were then labeled, and the equivalent chain length (ECL) values were computed by the Sherlock software. The polar lipids profile was analyzed by extracting cells with methanol-chloroform-saline (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) from 1 g of freeze-dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was performed by two-dimensional chromatography on a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform-methanol-water (75:32:4, v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (86:16:15:4, v/v/v/v) in the second dimension. The total polar lipids profile was detected by spraying with 6% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. The respiratory isoprenoid quinone was extracted with a chloroform-methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), evaporated under vacuum, re-extracted with acetone, and analyzed using high-performance lipid chromatography as per established methods (Ramaprasad et al., 2018).",
    "results": "Results and Discussion This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only. Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Table 1) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11T. Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA (Figure 1), gyrB (Figure 2), atpD (Supplementary Figure 1), recA (Supplementary Figure 2), dnaK (Supplementary Figure 3), rpoB (Supplementary Figure 4), and glnI (Supplementary Figure 5) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually (Figure 3). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated (Figure 4). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11T. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum. In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1) and gyrB (Figure 2) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687T.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI (Yoon et al., 2017) and 70% dDDH values (Auch et al., 2010), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium. These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11T, and M. platani PMB02T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system (Kurtz et al., 2004). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6, genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2T. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented. Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2. The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3, in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L-arabinose, D-glucose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5, respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum, these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum. Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

All strains exhibited 0-1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30°C but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45°C. Growth lower than 25°C might be possible but not tested.The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium, with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (Green and Bousfield, 1982). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3. For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species. Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4. The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C18:0 3-OH, C16:0, C17:0, Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C18:0 and C12:0, and traces of C11:0, C13:0, and C14:0. The fatty acids, C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c, were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed (Table 4). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C18:1 ω7c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid (Supplementary Figure 7). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium. Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T, type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5. All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1. A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) (Table 5). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T (Wanner, 1993, 1996). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii (Seuylemezian et al., 2017) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii (Singh et al., 2019). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (Orsini et al., 2017; Aunins et al., 2018). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future. Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase (miaA) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Tani et al., 2015) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens (Koenig et al., 2002). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L-threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented (Supplementary Figure 8). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (Krug et al., 2020). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8. Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. (Krug et al., 2020). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (Amin et al., 2015). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium, for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T). Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25–30°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D-glucose, D-maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D-melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%. The type strain IF7SW-B2T is isolated from the International Space Station.",
    "discussion": "Results and Discussion This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only. Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Table 1) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11T. Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA (Figure 1), gyrB (Figure 2), atpD (Supplementary Figure 1), recA (Supplementary Figure 2), dnaK (Supplementary Figure 3), rpoB (Supplementary Figure 4), and glnI (Supplementary Figure 5) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually (Figure 3). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated (Figure 4). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11T. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum. In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1) and gyrB (Figure 2) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687T.

Whole Genome Sequence–Based Phylogenetic Analysis The genomes of the four isolated ISS strains were sequenced, with their draft genome assembled and annotated. The results are summarized in Table 1. The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae. TABLE 1.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI (Yoon et al., 2017) and 70% dDDH values (Auch et al., 2010), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium. These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11T, and M. platani PMB02T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system (Kurtz et al., 2004). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6, genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2T. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented. Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2. The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3, in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L-arabinose, D-glucose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5, respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum, these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum. Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

Growth lower than 25°C might be possible but not tested.The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium, with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (Green and Bousfield, 1982). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3. For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species. Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4. The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C18:0 3-OH, C16:0, C17:0, Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C18:0 and C12:0, and traces of C11:0, C13:0, and C14:0. The fatty acids, C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c, were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed (Table 4). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C18:1 ω7c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid (Supplementary Figure 7). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium. Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T, type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5. All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1. A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) (Table 5). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T (Wanner, 1993, 1996). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii (Seuylemezian et al., 2017) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii (Singh et al., 2019). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (Orsini et al., 2017; Aunins et al., 2018). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future. Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase (miaA) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Tani et al., 2015) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens (Koenig et al., 2002). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L-threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented (Supplementary Figure 8). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (Krug et al., 2020). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8. Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. (Krug et al., 2020). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (Amin et al., 2015). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium, for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T). Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar.

In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D-glucose, D-maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D-melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c).

Copyright notice ID: 8005752 PMID: 33790880 Abstract Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1−ω7c and C18:1−ω6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T). Keywords: Methylobacterium, polyphasic taxomony, ANI, international space station (ISS), whole genome sequencingIntroduction The genus Methylobacterium contains more species than any other genera within the family Methylobacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales, and class Alphaproteobacteria (Kelly et al., 2014). Methylobacterium species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The genus was first proposed by Patt et al. (1976) with Methylobacterium organophilum as the type species. The genus Methylobacterium was first emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (Patt et al., 1976). Another taxonomic study classified all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genus Methylobacterium (Green and Bousfield, 1982). Thereafter, 11 species from the genus Methylobacterium were redefined into a new genus proposed as Methylorubrum, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (Green and Ardley, 2018). The genus Methylobacterium consists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (Gallego et al.,2005a,b; Kang et al., 2007; Veyisoglu et al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2014; Kwak et al., 2014; Chaudhry et al., 2016; Green and Ardley, 2018; Park et al., 2018). Methylobacterium species are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (Madhaiyan et al., 2006; Kumar M. et al., 2016; Parasuraman et al., 2019; Grossi et al., 2020; Krug et al., 2020). For instance, a novel Methylobacterium sp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (Grossi et al., 2020). Furthermore, genomic analysis of Methylobacterium sp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (Grossi et al., 2020). In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae were isolated (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Some of the Methylobacterium species that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (Kang et al., 2007; Chaudhry et al., 2016), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and define the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Methylobacterium strains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants.Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Isolation of Bacteria Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking–1 flight experiments from 2015 to 2016. Sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms were published elsewhere (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Briefly, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (Checinska et al., 2015; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25°C for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies (n = 4) isolated from three different locations and from a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and differential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW-B2T was isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location #7, the Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1-R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA filter that was returned aboard STS-134/ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (Checinska et al., 2015).DNA Extraction and Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis A biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25°C for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 platform with a paired-end module. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain, 2012) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) genome assembler (k-mer size- 32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. The genome was annotated using the  () Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 4.11 (Tatusova et al., 2016; Haft et al., 2018). In addition, functional annotation of genome and seed categories were assigned to the genome by implementing the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) tool (Aziz et al., 2008). Genomes of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from , and the genomic relatedness of ISS strains was identified based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; FastANI) calculations (Jain et al., 2018) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). FastANI was run on all the genomes using the default parameters: Mashmap identity cutoff I0 = 80%, non-overlapping fragments of size l = 3Kb, and minimum count of reciprocal mappings τ = 50.Phylogenetic Analysis Phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and MLSA using six housekeeping genes: ATP synthase F1 beta subunit (atpD), DNA strand exchange and recombination gene (recA), chaperone gene (dnaK), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), glutamine synthetase type I (glnI), and DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), for differentiating Methylobacterium species (Green and Ardley, 2018). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all 45 Methylobacterium species were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, representative species of genus Methylorubrum, Enterovirga, Microvirga, and Neomegalonema from family Methylobacteriaceae, Rhizobium from order Rhizobiales, Caulobacter from order Caulobacterales, in class Alphaproteobacteria were included. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was selected as the outgroup. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains were retrieved from  except for the four ISS strains, which were recovered from their respective WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes and MLSA was carried out with type strains of 24 Methylobacterium species and representative species of other genera. All the gene sequences were retrieved from the genome sequences using RAST v2.01 (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014; Brettin et al., 2015). The individual gene sequences for all strains were aligned separately using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). For MLSA, six housekeeping gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually and aligned using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). The genome-based tree for the Methylobacterium species, including ISS strains and representative species of other genus with available WGS, was constructed using GToTree (Lee, 2019). This tool takes the complete/draft genomes as input and creates a phylogenomic tree based on the prespecified single-copy gene set using a hidden Markov model (HMM); the tool currently has 2,044 unique HMM set as identifiers to cover all three domains of microbial life.Phenotypic Characterization of ISS Strains Phenotypic characterization was performed according to standard protocols (Jones, 1981). Growth of the ISS strains at different temperatures (7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C) was assessed after incubation on nutrient agar (Sigma, United States) for 7 days. Growth at different pH (4.0–10.0 at intervals of 1.0) was assessed after incubation in nutrient broth (Sigma, United States) at 30°C for 7 days. The pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted using citrate/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 4.0–5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0), and tris buffer (pH 9.0–10.0) (Kim et al., 2019). Salt tolerance was tested by streaking the strains on R2A supplemented with NaCl (0–10% at intervals of 1%) and incubating the plates at 30°C for 7 days. Motility was assessed via the “hanging drop” method by observing the culture under a light microscope (Tindall et al., 2007). Catalase activity was tested by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide to culture grown on R2A at 30°C for 7 days, and effervescence was monitored (Tindall et al., 2007). An oxidase test was carried out in a filter paper soaked with the substrate tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and coloration was documented (Jurtshuk Jr. and McQuitty, 1976). All other physiological and biochemical tests were carried out using API 20 NE, API 50 CH, and API ZYM kits as per manufacturer’s procedures (bioMérieux, France).Chemotaxonomic Analysis All strains grown in the R2A broth were harvested when growth of the cultures reached around 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase), and then the cultures were used for analyses of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which were carried out as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Briefly, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cell pellet from each strain was subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with Sherlock MIS software (Microbial ID; MIDI 6.0 version; Agilent: 6850)2. The peaks obtained were then labeled, and the equivalent chain length (ECL) values were computed by the Sherlock software. The polar lipids profile was analyzed by extracting cells with methanol-chloroform-saline (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) from 1 g of freeze-dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was performed by two-dimensional chromatography on a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform-methanol-water (75:32:4, v/v/v) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (86:16:15:4, v/v/v/v) in the second dimension. The total polar lipids profile was detected by spraying with 6% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. The respiratory isoprenoid quinone was extracted with a chloroform-methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), evaporated under vacuum, re-extracted with acetone, and analyzed using high-performance lipid chromatography as per established methods (Ramaprasad et al., 2018).Results and Discussion This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only. Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Table 1) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11T. Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA (Figure 1), gyrB (Figure 2), atpD (Supplementary Figure 1), recA (Supplementary Figure 2), dnaK (Supplementary Figure 3), rpoB (Supplementary Figure 4), and glnI (Supplementary Figure 5) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually (Figure 3). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated (Figure 4). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11T. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum. In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene (Figure 1) and gyrB (Figure 2) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687T.

The results are summarized in Table 1. The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae. TABLE 1.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI (Yoon et al., 2017) and 70% dDDH values (Auch et al., 2010), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium. These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11T, and M. platani PMB02T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system (Kurtz et al., 2004). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6, genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2T. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented.Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2. The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3, in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L-arabinose, D-glucose, maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5, respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum, these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum. Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

All strains exhibited 0-1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30°C but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45°C. Growth lower than 25°C might be possible but not tested.The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium, with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (Green and Bousfield, 1982). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3. For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species.Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4. The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C18:0 3-OH, C16:0, C17:0, Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C18:0 and C12:0, and traces of C11:0, C13:0, and C14:0. The fatty acids, C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c, were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed (Table 4). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C18:1 ω7c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid (Supplementary Figure 7). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium.Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T, type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5. All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1. A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) (Table 5). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T (Wanner, 1993, 1996). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii (Seuylemezian et al., 2017) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii (Singh et al., 2019). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (Orsini et al., 2017; Aunins et al., 2018). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future.Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase (miaA) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Tani et al., 2015) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens (Koenig et al., 2002). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L-threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented (Supplementary Figure 8). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (Krug et al., 2020). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8. Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. (Krug et al., 2020). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (Amin et al., 2015). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium, for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T).Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25–30°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D-glucose, D-maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D-melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%. The type strain IF7SW-B2T is isolated from the International Space Station.Data Availability Statement The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Methylobacterium sp. IIF1SW-B5, and Methylobacterium sp.

SB independently verified the genome assembly, generated alignments for all gene trees in the manuscript, and manually curated the tree images. KV and NKS isolated the type strain, and NKS carried out the phenotypic assays and biochemical characterization. KV compiled the contribution of write-ups from all authors associated with phenotype, NKS generated genotype and tables, and SB generated phylogenetic trees and figures. VE conducted the SB generated chemotaxonomic analysis. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. CEM generated the genomic library and sequenced the genomes of all strains.
