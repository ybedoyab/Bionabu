    "abstract": "Summary Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Grimm et al., 2016; Indo et al., 2016; Kononikhin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Clément et al., 2020, Salim, 2017, Friedman, 2011). Spanning over 60 years of research, the short-term impacts of spaceflight on the CNS have been investigated, but there is still insufficient data regarding its long-term health risks (Clément et al., 2020). Also, there are limitations to evaluating the impact of CNS damage in humans. Therefore, there is a need to leverage research approaches using animal models that would aid in cellular, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of CNS responses to spaceflight. Recent literature has established the fruit fly as a valuable model for understanding the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and radiation in the spaceflight environment (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikenaga et al., 1997; Marcu et al., 2011; Ogneva et al., 2016). With their small size, short generation time (~10 days), short lifespan (~60-80 days), large number of offspring, and low cost of rearing, flies mitigate many of the practical concerns stemming from performing long term, multigenerational studies in space. Here, we present the results of an International Space Station (ISS)-based study, MVPFly-01(Multi-use Variable-gravity Platform), to understand the effects of spaceflight on the fly nervous system and the value of artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure. AG is an attractive countermeasure, since it can potentially ameliorate the effect of microgravity (μg) on multiple physiological systems, by simulating Earth-like gravity (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Horie et al., 2019; Shiba et al., 2017; Young, 1999). We performed behavioral analyses, brain immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and transcriptomics on flies subjected to microgravity (SFμg), inflight artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g), and environmentally matched ground control (Earth). Our results showed inflight and postflight behavioral changes and morphological alterations in the brain immediately postflight in response to μg. Further, acclimation to Earth following spaceflight revealed brain morphological changes in both SF1g and SFμg flies, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg. These results, in combination with metabolic pathways altered in transcriptomic and proteomic studies on fly heads frozen on the ISS provide comprehensive information on the effects of inflight AG exposure on CNS and postflight acclimation to Earth conditions.",

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS A. Spaceflight mission and Hardware Description The MVP-Fly01 mission (Figure 1A, B) was launched on SpaceX-14 to the ISS at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Flies were kept in the MVP hardware throughout the 34-day mission on the ISS (Figure S1A). The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean was the same day at 20:00 UTC. The mission used the MVP hardware (Redwire/Techshot, Inc., Greenville, Indiana) that supports easy food changes, allowing for a large population of flies to be maintained over multiple generations. It is also equipped with UI-1491LE video cameras used to capture time course footage of D. melanogaster (Figure S1B). The hardware consists of uniform white LED illumination which was programmed for a 12-hr:12-hr (light: dark) cycle for each habitat. Fresh cabin air was continuously circulated through the habitat to maintain steady CO2 and O2 levels. The housing system consists of two independent centrifuge units maintained within the same habitat enclosure, each containing six MVP modules (Figure S1A, B). For this experiment, one centrifuge was rotated at 68 rpm to artificially simulate Earth’s gravity (SF1g) in space. The other centrifuge was rotated at 2.2 rpm, making the g-level at the outer edge of the carousel at approximately 0.00095g (SFμg). This minimal rotation of SFμg ensured temperature uniformity between all experimental modules, while maintaining the microgravity levels of the ISS. Each MVP module has two adult fly chambers and three food cylinders (Figure S1B). Each food cylinder holds approximately 9.2 mL of standard fly food (Gilbert et al., 2020) containing foodgrade blue food dye. The presence of the dye allowed for the differentiation between early and late third instar larvae during postflight specimen sorting. Its inclusion is not relevant to the current analysis of adult flies performed here. The hardware design allowed for the passage of two generations of flies sequentially from adult fly chamber 2 to adult fly chamber 1 (Figure S1B). The MVP hardware has video imaging capabilities, and 28-second video footage of the adult fly chambers was taken regularly throughout the 12-hr light period. Although the MVP hardware has night video recording capability, it was not utilized in this mission due to technical difficulties with the infrared lighting. Each 28-second video consisted of 368 frames with an image resolution of 1986×1064 pixels. This video was periodically checked during the mission to ensure the health of flies and gauge the overall well-being. Upon return, this video was analyzed for inflight behavior to compute adult fly activity in SF1g and SFμg conditions during the mission. Following the completion of the mission, the samples were returned to Port of Long Beach, California, and transported via a climate-controlled vehicle to NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), California, within 7 hours of landing. Temperature and humidity loggers were also programmed to monitor the samples throughout the journey. All dissections, fixation of brain tissue, and postflight behavioral analysis (described below) were performed within 24 hours of arrival at NASA ARC (Return+0 days = R+0). A small subset of flies separated by sex was placed in an incubator at 24°C for acclimation to earth condition for 25 days (Return+25 days = R+25), and the brains from these flies were processed for immunohistochemical analysis similar to R+0 flies (Figure 1B). During the mission, a small set consisting of only two MVP modules (synchronous control) was reared in a ground-based incubator with real-time changes in temperature, humidity, and CO2 matching the telemetry recorded on the ISS. The synchronous control was checked periodically to ensure the overall health of the flies during the mission but was not used for any of the postflight analysis. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control with the same hardware used for the mission was conducted in a ground-based incubator with six MVP modules resulting in 883 flies. For the postflight control (Earth), flies were placed in each module to match the flight condition and were reared under identical conditions to match the temperature, relative humidity, O2, and CO2 levels recorded for the entire experiment on the ISS. The CO2 levels within habitats in space are often significantly higher than those on the ground due to the technical difficulty of scrubbing the CO2 from an entirely enclosed environment (ISS). The average CO2 level in the MVP hardware during this experiment ranged between 3500-5443 ppm during the mission and was replicated temporally and identically in the ground control. By comparison, the CO2 level under regular laboratory conditions averages <1000 ppm (Hussin et al., 2017). Also, another variable in any spaceflight study is sound pressure level. Based on ISS’s telemetry data and payload permissible limits, SF1g and SFμg flies in the MVP module on ISS experienced average sound pressure levels of 65dB. Similar sound pressure levels (62-65dB) were noted in the vicinity of the Earth controls placed in the laboratory incubator (Percival Scientific). The Earth control flies were fixed in RNAlater and subjected to postflight analyses following the same timeline as the flies from ISS. The Earth control used for comparison and statistical analysis in this manuscript is this postflight ground control.B. Fly husbandry, loading the module, and development The w1118 wildtype line (Bloomington Stock Center) was used in this study. Thirty hours prior to launch, one-day-old virgin male (10) and female (25) fruit flies were loaded into the adult food cylinder 3 in each of the six MVP modules (F0 generation). The food cylinder was then immediately opened to adult fly chamber 2 (Figure S1B, C). The modules were then placed inside of a standard cargo transfer bag for launch. Prepared food cylinders were stored at 4°C for the duration of launch and ISS operations. Approximately 3.7 days (90 hrs) after launch, the payload was delivered to the ISS and the crew installed a food cylinder 2 inside the MVP module and opened the food cylinder 2 to adult fly chamber 2 (Mission day=5), giving flies access to the new food. Food cylinder 3 was closed at this time. This procedure was repeated for all MVP modules, and the modules were loaded into the previously installed MVP habitat hardware (Figure S1A) by the ISS crew. At this time, the six SF1g modules started spinning at 68 rpm to maintain 1g in spaceflight while the six SFμg modules were maintained at microgravity levels. After 5.5 days of egg laying (Mission Day=10), food cylinder 2 was opened to adult fly chamber 1 to allow the eggs laid in space to develop and emerge into adult flies in chamber 1. At the same time food cylinder 2 was closed to adult fly chamber 2, such that the launch populations of flies were prevented from entering food cylinder 2, thus keeping the generations separated (Figure S1C). Food cylinder 3 was reopened to adult fly chamber 2 to continue providing food to this population for the remainder of the experiment. The larvae and flies that emerged from the food cylinder 2 into the adult fly chamber 1 had undergone their entire developmental life cycle during spaceflight (F1 generation). At this time, food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1 to allow egg laying in cylinder 1, which will produce the second generation of spaceflight-developed flies (F2 generation). Food cylinder 2 remained open to chamber 1 during egg lay to allow adults to continue emerging. This also allowed us to know the age range of the adult flies returned for postflight experiments (~11-17-day adults). After 8 days of egg laying, food cylinder 1 from each module containing F2 generation fruit fly eggs and larvae, and some F1 generation adults, was fixed in RNAlater (Invitrogen). This allowed us to have samples that were fixed in RNAlater in space for “omics” analyses on the ground to track the progression of acclimation to spaceflight as animals develop in space under different gravity conditions. Following the fixation, a fresh food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1, and food cylinder 2 was closed. The MVP locker was powered down after the experiment, and fixed F1 generation flies and F2 generation eggs and larvae were placed in the MELFI-2 freezer at −80°C until the samples returned. Thus, this experimental design allowed us to freeze adult flies (F1 generation), larvae (F2 generation), and eggs (F2 generation) at Day 29. Postflight, we retrieved live adult flies (F1 generation), and eggs and larvae of F2 generation in the new food cylinder 1. All the science operations, including food cylinder changes and fixation and opening/closing of chambers, were performed by the ISS crew. Unforeseen weather conditions delayed the mission by 4 days, during which the crew repowered the MVP hardware on mission day 31 and powered it off on mission day 34 for return to Earth. METHOD DETAILS A. Inflight behavioral analysis To quantify fly activity on the ISS, a simple but robust algorithm was developed using image-processing techniques in Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999) running on a MacBook Pro with an i7 core processor. Only the videos from adult fly chamber 1 SF1g and SFμg were analyzed in this study (Mission days 13 to 28 – Figure S1C) since these chambers contained the flies bred entirely in space (F1 generation). The age of the flies assessed from video imaging of the inflight behavior ranged from 1 to 16-days (Postflight assays were conducted with flies with a smaller age range as described in the relevant sections). Similar video recording arrangements were made for Earth condition, but the videos could not be recorded due to technical issues. Full resolution 8-bit images (1986x1064) were used for analysis. The individual frames from the video images have a predominant intensity in the blue channel (Figure 1C.i). Therefore, each video image was separated into its three RGB components, and the blue channel (shown in grayscale) was inverted and used for further analysis (Figure 1C.ii) as it provided best visualization of the flies. Once inverted, resulting images had individual flies that appeared as white pixels on a gray background. For each movie, maximum intensity projections (MIP) were computed by overlaying individual video frames and keeping the brightest pixels across all time points, resulting in a stroboscopic motion-like effect (Figure 1C.iii and 1C.iv). The pixel location of the MIP was mapped on a composite image to visualize the locomotion of individual flies during each video. These tracks had a higher intensity and appeared brighter than the background. Flies that did not move did not create a track, as seen between Figure 1C.ii and 1C.iii indicated in green. However, flies that were active during the video recording created a white track, shown in Figures 1C.ii and 1C.iii in blue and red. This process resulted in a single image that displayed the tracks of the fly population throughout a series of 28-second video recordings (Figure 1C.iv). Using the MIP images of adult fly chamber 1, we could determine when flies were active. The videos from mission day 13 to 28 (Figure S1C) that tracked the F1 generation of flies as shown in Figures 1D, E. In other words, this time frame included initial fly emergence when the majority of the space-bred generation of flies entered adult fly chamber 1 from food cylinder 2 but ended prior to fly numbers and debris levels increasing to a point where the camera view was obstructed (Figure S2). The number of flies in a chamber increased over time due to reproduction based on the life cycle of D. melanogaster (Fernández-Moreno et al., 2007) (Figure S2). Six videos per day, each 28 seconds in duration that spanned the 12-hr light period, were processed to produce MIP images for each fly module. One of the six modules containing the population bred in μg malfunctioned during flight, so our analysis includes six modules in SF1g and five modules in SFμg. Videos from adult fly chamber 2 were not used for analysis because 1) the build-up of debris due to more extended periods of growth compared to adult fly chamber 1 obscured the camera view, and 2) the chamber contained mixed generations of flies. The pixel intensities were summed for each MIP image, resulting in a single numerical value for every video. The more a fly moves, the longer are the white streaks that can be observed along its path on the MIP and the higher is the total measured intensity. The process was repeated for each video producing a series of numerical values to quantify the overall activity of the fly population during the mission. Supplementary video 1, 2 is a representative video showing the fly chambers of SF1g and SFμg, where suspended flies are seen in microgravity condition. The color map in Figure 1D was generated by setting the minimum value in the color map to the baseline intensity obtained from the first frame of the video. The intensities across all modules and treatments were scaled such that the video with the MIP image having the highest summated intensity (and therefore highest activity) was set to the maximum color on the color scale (Figure 1D). Note: No videos were analyzed for activity past day 28 due to the increased fly numbers and debris interfering with the image quality.B. Climbing assay Climbing assay was performed on F1 generation of flies returned to Earth using a modified version of Le Bourg and Lints (Feany and Bender, 2000). For each condition, flies were sorted and collected by sex, in groups of ten per food vial (F=100, M=100) as soon as the live flight samples were returned on earth (i.e., Fig. 1B, splash at L+34, 2 days for samples turnover (Long Beach, CA) and arrived at NASA ARC (R+0) and the assay was conducted. During the climbing assay, flies were transferred to a clean, empty vial and allowed to adjust for 1 minute. The flies were tapped down to the bottom, and the number of flies climbing past the 5 cm mark measured from the bottom of the vial in 18 seconds was recorded as a percentage of flies able to climb per vial (climbing ability). This assay was repeated three times for each vial, with a 30 second rest between trials. An average of three trials was reported per vial. Measurements from all three trials were averaged. The significance was determined between the conditions by a one-way ANOVA analysis with the condition as the independent variable.C. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging of brains F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. The R+0 and R+25 brains were stained for immunohistochemical analysis (described below) where staining for different antibody markers was conducted at the same time to facilitate comparison and reduce variability. The brains were stained following a standard protocol (Iyer et al., 2018; Mhatre et al., 2014). Briefly, the fixed brains were washed with PBS and PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each, incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum (Catalog # 566380, Sigma) in PBT) for one hour, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. One set of brains were stained with anti-elav (1:100, Catalog # 7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), host species - rat) to label all the neurons, anti-cc3 (1:100, Catalog # 9661, Cell signaling Technology, host species - rabbit) as apoptotic marker, and anti-8-oxo-dG (1:100, Catalog # 4354-MC-050, R&D systems, host species - mouse) as the DNA oxidative damage marker. Another set of brains were stained with anti-Repo (1:50, Catalog # 8D12, DSHB), University of Iowa, host species - mouse) to label the glia, and anti-TH (1:300, Catalog # AB152, EMD Millipore, host species - rabbit) to label the dopaminergic neurons. These preparations were then washed three times with PBT for 10 min each, and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Catalog # A-11031, Invitrogen), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Catalog # A-11034, Invitrogen), or Alexa fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200; Catalog # A21094, Invitrogen). Final washes were performed once with PBT and twice with PBS, each for 10 min, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000) for imaging. Stained brains were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope in the histology and microscopy core facility at the Gladstone Institute, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The ELAV neuronal cortex, neuropil, and the total brain area were traced and quantified using Image J software (v1.52g, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). This method is a gross measurement adapted from previously published papers (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Mhatre et al., 2014). The data reported here are the neuronal cortex and neuropil area normalized to the total brain area. Similarly, the number of puncta for TH (total number of TH-positive cells), repo, 8-oxo-dG, and CC3 were analyzed and quantified for each stain/marker using the cell counter in ImageJ software and are reported as absolute values.D. RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis of fly heads The food cylinders that were frozen on ISS were slow-thawed at 4°C before opening. Once thawed, cylinders were opened, and flies (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) were removed and sorted by sex. The head was removed using spring scissors and placed in RNAlater to preserve the RNA and protein integrity. Total RNA was extracted using RNA/Protein Purification plus (Norgen) from adult heads with four biological replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate). This kit isolated total RNA and protein from the same samples. Isolated RNA was used to perform paired-end RNA sequencing on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, with an average of 20M reads of PE150 per sample (Novogene, Sacramento, CA). Data validation and quality control with FASTQC were conducted by Novogene, Inc. The standardized Genelab pipeline was used for the analysis (Overbey et al., 2021). Briefly, raw RNA sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! v0.6.2 (Krueger, 2019), aligned to the Drosophila reference genome (Dmel release 6.08) and transcriptome with STAR Version 2.7.1a (Dobin et al., 2013), and read counts for each transcript were generated using RSEM v1.3.1. Differentially expressed gene lists were generated using a custom Genelab R script, GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, utilizing the DESeq2 v1.22.2 R package (Lai Polo et al., 2020). False discovery rate (adjusted p-value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment, and the differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.E. Proteomics and analysis of fly heads Proteins isolated from adult heads (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) using the Norgen Biotek kit were used to determine the global proteomic changes. Three replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate) were used for protein isolation and enzymatic digestion. Isolated protein samples were digested and desalted according to Lundby et al. (Lundby et al., 2012). Protein concentrations were then determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Proteins were then reduced, alkylated and subjected to acetone precipitation prior to digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Wako, Richmond, VA). This was followed by digestion with trypsin, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Promega, Madison, WI), and desalting and concentrating using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). TMT Isobaric Labeling - Peptides were mass tagged using Thermo-Fisher’s TMT 10-plex isobaric label kit (Catalog # 90061) following the included protocol and pooled for analysis. Six experimental conditions were labeled in triplicate across three TMT-runs, including two internal control channels.Basic Reversed-Phase Fractionation – Pooled TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by basic pH reversed-phase (BPRP) fractionation on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) using an integrated fraction collector. Elution was performed using a 10-minute gradient of 0-20% solvent B followed by a 50-minute gradient of solvent B from 20-45% (Solvent A 5.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, Solvent B 90.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0) on a Zorbax 300Extend-C18 column (Agilent) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A total of 24 fractions were collected at 37-second intervals in a looping fashion for 60 minutes then combined to produce 12 super fractions. Peptide elution was monitored at a wavelength of 220nm using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 variable wavelength detector (Thermo Scientific). Each fraction was then centrifuged to near dryness and desalted using C18 Sep-Pak Cartridges followed again by centrifugation to near dryness and reconstitution with 20 ul of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry- BPRP fractions were then separated using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) on a self-packed C18 column (100 um x 35 cm). Separation was performed using a 180-minute gradient of solvent B from 2-27% (Solvent A 0.1% Formic Acid, Solvent B Acetonitrile, 0.1% Formic Acid) at 50°C using a digital PicoView nanospray source (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) that was modified with a custom-built column heater and an ABIRD background suppressor (ESI Source Solutions, Woburn, MA). An in-house column was prepared by packing a 100μm inner diameter picofrit column (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) with 1.9μm ReproSil-Pure C18 (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) and packed to a length of 30 cm at 9000 psi using a nano-LC column packing kit (nanoLCMS, Gold River, CA). Mass spectral analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). TMT analysis was performed using an MS3 multi-notch approach. The MS1 precursor selection range is from 400-1400 m/z at a resolution of 120K and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2.0 x 105 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Quadrupole isolation at 0.7 Th for MS2 analysis using CID fragmentation in the linear ion trap with a collision energy of 35%. The AGC was set to 4.0 x 103 with a maximum injection time of 150ms. The instrument was operated in a top-speed data-dependent mode with a most intense precursor priority with dynamic exclusion set to an exclusion duration of 60 seconds with a 10ppm tolerance. MS2 fragment ions were captured in the MS3 precursor population. These MS3 precursors were then isolated within a 2.5 Da window and subjected to high energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 55%. The ions were then detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC of 5.0 x 104 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. The data was then analyzed using SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version v.27, rev. 11.) and Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA. version 2.1).Database Searching Tandem mass spectra were extracted, and charge states were deconvoluted by Proteome Discoverer version 2.1. Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) by searching the data against a protein database, including all entries from the Uniprot Drosophila proteome (UniProt UP00000803, containing 21,041 sequences, download date 10-29-2019) combined with the common contaminants sequences from the Global Proteome Machine. Sequest searches were performed using a parent ion tolerance of 1.25 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00005 Da, and requiring each peptides’ termini to have trypsin protease specificity while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) was set as static modification, while TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.162932 Da), acetylation of the protein Nterminus, and methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as variable modification. Reporter Ions Quantifier settings were set to include unique and razor peptides, Quan value correction factors from manufacturer applied, co-isolation threshold 50%, average reporter S/N 10, and no normalization or scaling of the channels.Proteomic Data Analysis The unscaled, non-normalized protein-level total reporter ion intensities derived from unique peptides were exported from Proteome Discoverer. Data quality assessment and control, normalization and analyses were performed using R v 4.0.1. Proteins underwent three filtering steps: 1) proteins containing missing values in any condition, 2) proteins with fewer than two unique peptide matches, and 3) proteins identified in only one or two out of the three runs were excluded from the quantitative analysis. Each TMT run was internally scaled, then transformed and analyzed together. Merged data were greatly affected by commonly seen batch effects associated to individual runs. Bioconductor package Limma v 3.44.3 was used to identify sexspecific abundance differences per protein in response to changing gravity conditions relative to ground/earth control by performing an empirical Bayes moderated t-test accounting for the seen batch effect caused by each individual TMT run (Ritchie et al., 2015). Calculated p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistically significant difference was defined by an FDR cutoff of 0.05.F. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis The differentially expressed genes and proteins with FDR adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were used for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.0 (Yu et al., 2012) and Drosophila database (org.Dm.eg.db version 3.13). Specifically, we used enrichGO and enrichKEGG functions to determine functionally enriched GO categories for are three annotations: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) and KEGG pathways (Carbon et al., 2021) for all contrasts across both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. Results were visualized by R packages ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and pheatmap (Kolde, 2015). The intersecting genes and proteins within and across the multi-omics platform were plotted using the Upset plot (Khan and Mathelier, 2017). Pathway visualization was performed using the KEGG mapper function provided by Kanehisa Laboratories (https://www.kegg.jp/). Venn diagrams were generated using Venny 2.1 (Oliveros, 2015). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantification methods for the various assays and parameters are described in the relevant Methods section. Statistical analyses and plot generation were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v. 9.1.0). For Figure 1E, two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed to determine statistical significance. Grubbs test was performed on all climbing and immunohistochemistry datasets to remove outliers. In Figures 2, 6 (A–C, F), S3A, and S7, Grubbs test was followed by testing for normal Gaussian distribution via the D’AgostinoPearson test except in data with a low sample size (TH and Repo), where the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was performed. If data were normally distributed, a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, was performed to determine statistical significance. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. For Figure 6D, a non-parametric t-test (Mann-Whitney test) was performed to compare all conditions (Earth, SF1g, and SFμg) within their respective time points (R+0, R+25). A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The error bars in the figures represent SEM (Standard Error Mean). All data are means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 5-12 per group). The number of flies used per experiment is indicated in the figure legend. Inflight behavior analysis was conducted by composing Matlab code using Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999).",
    "results": "Results The MVP-Fly-01 mission The ISS is a useful environment for studying the effects of spaceflight by combining a μg environment with ionizing radiation and CO2 levels that are elevated compared to Earth’s surface (McDonald et al., 2020). The MVP-Fly-01 validation mission (34 days) has enabled comprehensive investigations of the fly CNS (Figure 1A). The two inflight centrifuges in the MVP hardware allowed us to maintain one centrifuge at μg (SFμg) with the flies developing entirely in μg, while the other centrifuge simulated Earth’s gravitational force (SF1g) on ISS and acted as a high-fidelity on-orbit control for gravity. In other words, the spaceflown flies experienced identical environmental perturbations during take-off and landing, were maintained in identical hardware, similar gas composition, sound pressure levels, temperature, and radiation environments in space, but were reared either under a 1g force in space or in μg. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control experiment was performed on Earth (Earth) using the same flight hardware and precisely simulating spaceflight conditions. The flies retrieved upon completion of the mission were used for behavioral, morphological, and acclimation analyses to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS (Figure 1B). Figure 1: Inflight behavioral analysis shows hyperactivity in microgravity. Open in a new tab (A) Schematic of MVP-Fly01 mission outline depicting the 34-days mission on ISS. Camera represents inflight videos that were recorded to monitor fly health and behavior. Onboard operations included freezing the food cylinders containing flies and larvae in RNAlater for omics analysis. Live flies were returned to Earth. Following the telemetry and timeline of the mission, matched Earth controls were performed (Earth). (B) Experimental timeline highlighting the onboard operations and postflight R+0 and R+25 assays. (C) Computation of fly activity by MIP. i) The first frame from one video recorded during the mission. ii) The negative of the blue channel in grayscale of the first frame with two flies circled in green and red. iii) The MIP image captures the movement (blue and red arrows) and no movement (green) of the flies. iv) Final MIP projection used in the algorithm. The white tracks represent flies that moved at any point during the recording. (D) Fly activity mapped overtime for 16 days (mission day 13-28). Each row represents one adult fly chamber in an individual MVP module, and across from left to right is a temporal progression with every six rectangles (each rectangle = 28s video recording) spanning a single 12-hr light period. The color bar represents the activity level from a minimum background intensity (dark blue) to the highest activity level intensity (bright green). Top six rows correspond to SF1g flies and bottom five to SFμg flies. (E) Line graphs show increased activity levels across mission day 13-28 averaged over each day across modules for each population set (n=5-73). *p<0.05. SFμg flies exhibit increased activity on ISS We developed an automated quantification algorithm that computes the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of video recordings of fly behavior (represented in Videos S1 and S2) during spaceflight and sums pixel intensities to produce numerical values representative of fly activity levels (higher numerical values correlate with high fly activity), accounting for both the emergence of flies and their movement during the 12-hr light period (Figure 1C). Since the fly population sizes in adult fly chamber 1 were not statistically different between SF1g and SFμg (Figure S2), any difference in MIP intensity between these two groups reflected differences in fly activity. We generated a color map showing the relative numerical activity in adult fly chamber 1 as a function of mission timeline (days 13-28) for each module grouped as either SF1g or SFμg (Figure 1D). Upon quantification, we found that the overall activity level of the SF1g flies is significantly below SFμg flies (Figure 1E). On mission day 20 and 28, there is no distinguishable difference in the activity for the two gravity levels. This is possibly due to the initial emergence of flies into the adult fly chamber around day 20 that causes a similar increase in activity in both SF1g and SFμg environments. On day 28, the high density of flies in both conditions may result in close proximity of the flies, thereby increasing their activity levels. The results show that within the closely matched fly populations maintained in spaceflight, flies exposed to μg conditions show significantly greater levels of activity than their 1g counterparts. Flies exposed to microgravity conditions show behavioral and neuronal deficits, glial alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis Upon landing, a subset of F1 flies were first used for behavioral assays to measure climbing ability. Climbing ability is the fly’s innate negative geotactic response and is routinely used to assess nervous system dysfunction in fly models (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Iijima et al., 2004). This behavior relies on the integrity of the connection between the brain and muscles. Specifically, it involves the mushroom body, which is the part of the brain that regulates the transition from rest to responsiveness in relation to environmental stressors (Martin et al., 1998). To capture the sexually dimorphic responses, we assessed males and females separately in our analysis. We observed that males born in μg were more affected with significant deficits in climbing ability compared to Earth males (Figure 2A). A decreasing trend was also observed in SFμg females and SF1g (males and females) compared to their respective Earth control. Additionally, we noted a significant decrease in climbing ability in SFμg males compared to SFμg females. This result is consistent with the previously observed reduction in postflight climbing response in males exposed to μg (Benguría et al., 1996). Figure 2: CNS-associated deficits in microgravity flies. Open in a new tab (A) Decreased climbing ability of space-flown flies (n=90-120). (B) Representative image of fly brain stained with neuronal marker, anti-ELAV; neuronal cortex marked by the dashed outer white line and neuropil marked by the dashed inner yellow line. Quantification shows decrease in neuronal cortex area (C) and neuropil area (D) in SFμg compared to both Earth and SF1g controls (n=10-14). (E) Representative images of fly brains labeled with anti-TH (green), anti-REPO (red), anti-CC3 (white), and anti-8-oxo-dG (cyan). Quantification showed significant loss in DA neurons (F) (n=6-9) and alterations in glial numbers (G) (n=5-9), apoptosis (H) (n=5-7), and oxidative DNA damage (I) (n=5-7) in SFμg condition. Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the histogram. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.We then dissected the adult fly brains and stained them with neuronal (anti-ELAV) (Figure 2B), apoptotic (anti-CC3), and oxidative stress-associated DNA damage (anti-8-oxo-dG) (Figure 2E) markers. Upon quantification, we observed a slight yet significant reduction in the total brain area of SFμg female flies compared to both Earth and SF1g females; males showed no change in brain sizes (Figure S3A). Morphological quantification with anti-ELAV staining showed a significant decrease in neuronal cortex area (Figure 2B, C, and S3B) in SFμg flies compared to Earth and SF1g control flies in both sexes. Similarly, the neuropil area is significantly reduced in SFμg compared to Earth flies (Figure 2D). A similar phenotype was noted in the Alzheimer’s disease fly model accompanied with behavioral deficits (Mhatre et al., 2014). No significant differences in neuronal cortex and neuropil areas were observed in SF1g compared to Earth flies (Figure 2C, D). A marked increase in CC3 positive apoptotic puncta (Figure 2E, H) and 8-oxo-dG positive cells (Figure 2E, I) was observed in flies subjected to SFμg as compared to Earth and SF1g controls. Apoptotic cells were detected throughout the brain, and many of them colocalized with the ELAV marker (Figure S3Cv). Additionally, all the 8-oxo-dG positive cells colocalize with neuronal ELAV marker, suggesting oxidative damage in neuronal cells (Figure S3Civ, marked with green arrowhead). The observed oxidative stress response has been documented in previous spaceflight and ground-based altered gravity studies in mice and flies (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016, 2018b, 2020; da Silveira et al., 2020). Another subset of brains was stained with glial (anti-Repo), and dopaminergic neuron (anti-TH) (Figure 2E) markers. Gross analysis of the total number of dopaminergic (DA) neurons revealed a reduction in DA neuron count in SFμg compared to SF1g and Earth fly brains in both sexes (Figure 2E, F). Like the climbing behavior, we observed significantly lowered DA neurons in SFμg males compared to SFμg females suggesting sensitivity of male flies to μg. DA neurons are involved in locomotion, and the lack of these neurons have been identified in the development of Parkinson’s disease in humans (Ryczko and Dubuc, 2017). We also observed a significant increase in DA neurons in SF1g males compared to the Earth males; this may be part of a phenotype resulting from exposure to a 1g centrifugal force on flies that are also perturbed by a combination of spaceflight stressors - ionizing radiation and elevated CO2 levels. In the case of glia, SFμg females and SF1g (both males and females) displayed an increasing trend in glial cell number compared to Earth controls. However, the SFμg males showed a decreasing trend in the glial population compared to Earth males (Figure 2E, G), and a significant reduction in the glial population compared to SF1g males. Further experiments are necessary to study the sex specificity of the spaceflight effects and the underlying mechanisms contributing to these differences in glial cell populations. The SF1g and Earth flies were exposed to similar temperature, humidity, CO2, and sound pressure levels, however, ionizing radiation was an additional spaceflight stressor experienced by the SF1g flies compared to the Earth flies. Thus, the similarity in morphological phenotype between SF1g and Earth control flies in many of the readouts analyzed here, including behavior, neuronal cortex and neuropil areas, apoptosis, and oxidative damage (Figure 2), suggests that radiation alone may not be a significant contributing factor for the immediate postflight CNS effects of spaceflight. However, ionizing radiation may contribute to some of the long-term effects of spaceflight on the CNS and are discussed further in a later section. The entire experiment occurred over a short duration (34 days) and the radiation environment in LEO is known to be more benign than the environment in deep space, beyond the Van Allen belts (Nelson, 2016). Therefore, the gross physiological changes induced in LEO flights like on ISS, as observed in SFμg flies, at least for the CNS immediately post-return, may primarily be associated with changes in gravity. Thus, these results indicate that gravity can play a key role in the LEO environment, causing neuronal and neurobehavioral deficits during spaceflight. Global omics analysis highlights spaceflight induced altered genes and proteins in the brain Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed on the heads of flies which developed entirely on ISS under SFμg or SF1g conditions and Earth controls (Figure 3A). RNAseq on heads from SFμg flies compared with Earth controls showed differential expression of 1014 genes in females and 507 genes in males, while proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 577 proteins in females and 719 proteins in males. RNAseq in SF1g flies compared to Earth reared flies showed differential expression of 80 genes in females and 601 genes in males, and proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 389 proteins in females and 425 proteins in males (Figure 3A). Overall, these results suggest alterations in transcripts and protein levels when flies are reared in space conditions compared to Earth condition. A full list of DEGs and DEPs is provided in Supplementary data (.xls 1 and 2). Further, to understand the overlap across the transcriptomics and proteomics as well as across the different experimental conditions, we generated an UpSet diagram displaying top 30 intersections (Figure 3B). The overlap between the DEGs (orange dots and bars) and DEPs (green dots and bars) for the experimental conditions is shown, and across DEGs and DEPs are marked in black. Also shown are the genes and proteins unique to each condition (grey dots and bars). The intersection within DEPs across experimental conditions yields more hits compared to DEGs. This is evidenced by 167 significantly altered proteins (adj. p-value < 0.05), compared to 25 significantly altered genes (adj. p-value<0.05) in SF1g and SFμg conditions compared to Earth controls (Figures 3B and S4A, B). The observed overlapping DEPs and DEGs are potential spaceflight signatures irrespective of gravity that can be further investigated. Additionally, though we observe minimal overlap across both transcriptomic and proteomic platform, the common processes possibly share a transcriptional mechanism of dysregulation, hence making these processes central towards the phenotype manifested in spaceflight flies. For example, as shown in the case of SFμg female compared to Earth female, the gene ontology (GO) analysis of overlapping DEPs and DEGs (65) revealed enrichment of key biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) that closely regulate mitochondrial functions, metabolic processes, immune response, and synaptic signaling, among others (Figure S4C).

Table provides a global view of the total number of differentially up and down regulated genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. (B) Upset plot displays top 30 intersections across omics platforms and between conditions (SF1g males, SF1g females, SFμg males, SFμg females). The purple horizontal bars indicate the total number of DEGs and DEPs identified in each condition. The dotted region shows all conditions, connecting lines with black nodes show overlap across omics platforms (DEGs and DEPs), whereas orange nodes show overlap across different conditions in DEGs and green nodes show overlap across different conditions in DEPs. Grey nodes represent the DEGs and DEPs unique to a condition. The vertical bars indicate the number of unique or overlapping genes/proteins. (C) Dot plot representing top 20 significantly (adj.p-value <0.05) enriched gene ontology (GO) terms in biological processes in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. SF1g female RNA compared to Earth control did not have any enriched GO biological processes, hence not represented in the dot plot. The color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. Focused analysis reveals differential alteration in metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation in space reared flies The spaceflight conditions (SF1g and SFμg) compared to Earth were analyzed across the omics platforms. Figure 3C highlights the top 20 significantly enriched GO biological processes, including cuticle development, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, metabolic processes, response to heat, protein folding, neurotransmitter secretion, synaptic vesicle signaling, and retinal homeostasis, among others. The enrichment is more evident in proteins compared to RNA. The complete list from GO enrichment analysis (BP, CC, MF) is provided in Supplementary.xls 1 and 2. Further, we note a sexually dimorphic response in the transcriptomic dataset, which is not observed in proteomics analysis (Figure S5). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the proteomics dataset across conditions revealed sexual dimorphism at the pathway enrichment level (more KEGG pathway enrichment in females than males), which was more evident in SF1g than SFμg condition. Proteomic data of SFμg flies (males and females) show enrichment of pathways such as endocytosis, cellular metabolic responsive pathways – tyrosine metabolism, sucrose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, glutamate metabolism, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4A). These metabolic pathways play critical roles in cellular as well as mitochondrial homeostasis. The metabolic reprogramming under spaceflight conditions suggests metabolic and cellular stress, similar to that observed in cancer and aging (Brooks Robey et al., 2015; Wallace, 2005). Similar regulation of metabolic pathways is observed in other spaceflight-based mammalian studies, including humans (GarrettBakelman et al., 2019b; de Luca et al., 2009; da Silveira et al., 2020; Stein, 2002). Analysis of cellular respiration revealed perturbations in the biological processes and cellular components encompassing every step of the pathway, i.e., glucose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle (TCA), and electron transport chain as well as at mitochondrial organelle level (Figure 4B, C). This is observed in both spaceflight conditions but is more pronounced in SFμg than SF1g (both sexes), suggesting differential regulation under the spaceflight stress ± gravity vector.

(D-F) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins (D), glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism proteins (E), and proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation (F) in SF1g and SFμg vs. Earth. (G) Differentially expressed proteins (in red) in SFμg females (vs. Earth females) are mapped onto the oxidative phosphorylation KEGG pathway using KEGG mapper. (H-I) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change] of proteins that are significantly expressed (adj. p-value<0.05) in fatty acid metabolism (H), and amino acid metabolism (I), with red representing upregulated and blue for downregulated.At the mitochondrial level, an increase in PGAM5 and mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins such as dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and OPA1 were observed, suggesting increased mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D). We observed the upregulation of many enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as hexokinase C (HEXC) and Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP) (Figure 4E), suggesting increased glycolytic flux (Tanner et al., 2018). Meanwhile, we observed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting funneling of glycolysis products towards lactate production under spaceflight conditions. Another key enzyme, AcCoAS, is downregulated, thereby reducing the production of Acetyl-CoA, a key enzyme required for the TCA cycle. Further, modulation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation/ETC is noted (Figure 4F). While ETC proteins are differentially regulated under both SF1g and SFμg conditions, the number of proteins regulated under SFμg is more than the SF1g condition. In fact, differential regulation of at least one protein associated with each of the five ETC complexes is observed under SFμg conditions (Figure 4G), which may contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, KEGG pathway enrichment shows differential regulation of fatty acid metabolism as well as amino acid metabolism. We observed an upregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid (Figure 4H) and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4I), suggesting high energy demand, thereby emphasizing cellular stress response under spaceflight conditions (SFμg> SF1g). Spaceflight alters the expression of stress-inducible proteins affecting CNS During spaceflight, metabolic pathways are altered along with the biological processes associated with cellular stress, including response to heat, response to ROS, ROS metabolic process, and cellular homeostasis, thus indicating increased cellular stress (Figure 5A). We see significant upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs): HSP70AB, HSP26, HSP23, HSP27, and HSP67BC in both spaceflight conditions (Figure 5B). HSPs are the molecular chaperones with cytoprotective properties that are induced in response to a variety of cellular insults such as heat, radiation, oxidative stress, and altered gravity, to confer protection against deteriorating effects of ROS (Bukau et al., 2006; Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikwegbue et al., 2018). Low amounts of ROS aid in neuronal development and function, but oxidative stress-induced excessive ROS levels lead to cellular damage, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and altered brain morphology, causing neuroinflammation and neuronal death (Gu, 2011). Our observations of increased neuronal loss, apoptosis and oxidative damage in the fly brain further confirm the effects of oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figure 2). These morphological defects in the brain correlate with the altered expression of proteins that are enriched in functions such as neuronal projection, neuron death, axonogenesis, and synaptic transmission in SFμg flies compared to Earth (Figure 5C). Figure 5: Increased cellular stress affects neuronal signaling in spaceflight. Open in a new tab (A) Dot plot showing enriched GO terms (adj. p-value<0.05) associated with cellular stress in biological processes and molecular function for SF1g and SFμg (DEPs) compared to Earth. (B) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) cellular stress response proteins. (C) Dot plot highlighting enriched GO terms (p<0.05) associated with neuronal and synaptic signaling in biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components across all conditions (DEPs). (D) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change of proteins that are significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) in synaptic transmission. For dot plot, the color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. For heatmap, the red color represents upregulated and blue shows downregulated proteins.In terms of neuronal functioning, we observed modulations in proteins involved in synaptic transmission across all spaceflight conditions (Figure 5D). For instance, SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (SYX1A), syntaxin binding protein SNAP24, presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin (SYT), presynaptic calcium signaling protein P32, endocytic fission protein dynamin (SHI), and endocytic coat protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) are downregulated. Meanwhile, the vesicle-mediated transport protein GDI, NSF1 protein that aids in disassembly of SNARE complex (COMT), cell-cell adhesion mediator protein FAS2, vesicular trafficking protein ARF79F, and synapsin (SYN), a phosphoprotein associated with synaptic vesicles, among others are upregulated. These proteins collectively encompass almost every step of the synaptic vesicle cycle. The number of proteins altered is higher in SFμg condition than SF1g, and within SFμg condition, males show more changes than females, further reinforcing the selective sensitivity towards males and a dose-dependent response across spaceflight condition. Additionally, proteins associated with muscle and cytoskeleton are also noted in spaceflight flies (SFμg> SF1g) (Figure S5 C,D), consistent with previous spaceflight findings (Ogneva et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2020). Persistent effects of exposure to spaceflight Proteomics analysis suggests enrichment of behavioral and aging markers in SF1g and SFμg flies (Figure S6A). Specifically, the upregulation of HSP26, HSP27, HSP68, MTPalpha, CAT, SM, and TRXR-1, LDH, and downregulation of DJ-1beta, MSRA, and LEVY is observed across all conditions (Figure S6B). These proteins are also associated with oxidative stress response, which has been shown to increase with age (Lavara-Culebras and Paricio, 2007; Liao et al., 2008; Long et al., 2020a; Ren et al., 2017). To further understand the effects of spaceflight as the flies acclimate to Earth’s gravity, we aged the flies for 25 days post-return under terrestrial conditions (R+25 days). Figure S7 shows the observed changes at R+25 timepoint for DA neuron counts, neuronal cortex area, apoptosis, and glial phenotypes. Overall, at the R+25 timepoint, the brain morphology of SF1g and SFμg is altered compared to Earth controls with sex-specific changes observed in the neuronal cortex area (Figure S7). We then performed the longitudinal comparison of morphological changes in fly brains between the R+0 (11-17 days old) and R+25 (36-42 days old) time points. This paradigm is similar to the post-mission evaluation of astronauts as they acclimate to Earth conditions over a period of time. Significant reduction of DA neurons was observed early in SFμg flies at the R+0 time point, compared to the gradual loss of these neurons in Earth and SF1g flies at the R+25 time point (Figure 6A). Typically, terrestrial conditions have not been associated with age-related loss of DA neurons (White et al., 2010), however, the elevated levels of CO2 in Earth flies (analogous to SF1g and SFμg) in this study may contribute to the observed loss of DA neurons as the flies age in the Earth controls. Further, comparison of neuronal cortex areas between R+0 and R+25 data showed no change in the Earth flies, while decreasing trend over time was noted in SF1g flies and a significant reduction in SFμg flies, thus suggesting increased neuronal loss with age in space reared flies (Figure 6B). This loss correlates with increased apoptosis observed in R+25 flies, both SF1g (39%) and SFμg (70%) compared to R+25 Earth flies (Figure 6C). This progressive increase in apoptosis in space-reared flies (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) may suggest a dose-dependent response in flies as we move from Earth to space conditions with exposure to multiple stressors, including increased ionizing radiation combined with exposure to reduced gravity. Figure 6: Persistent effects of spaceflight. Open in a new tab (A-D) Stacked bar plots showing quantification of DA neurons (A) (n=5-10), neuronal cortex area (B) (n=10-14), apoptosis (C) (n=5-7), and glia (D) at R+0 and R+25 days. (E) Representative images of R+25 fly brains labeled with anti-REPO (red). Quantification of Repo positive cells at R+25 days showed total glial loss (D) and increase in the aggregates/rosettes (F) (white box in E inset) in SFμg, SF1g (n=6-9). Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the stacked bar plots. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.Additionally, we assessed glia, the primary phagocytic cell in CNS that are required to clear oxidative stress-induced neuronal debris (Bilimoria and Stevens, 2015; Casano and Peri, 2015; Cronk and Kipnis, 2013; Cunningham, 2013; Freeman, 2006; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007). At R+25, while we observe a slight but non-significant increase in glial cell numbers under Earth conditions (females: 7%, males: 17%), a significant depletion of the glial population in Earth acclimated SF1g (females: 56%, males: 59%), and sex-specific depletion in SFμg flies (females: 54%, males: 33%) is noted compared to their respective R+0 timepoint (Figure 6D, E). This depletion of the glial population can be due to burdening of the clearance system, eventually leading to glial apoptosis (Block et al., 2007), but additional investigation is warranted. Furthermore, as the flies age, we observe aggregates of glial cells that resemble rosettes (Figure 6E, inset). These rosettes were distinct in size and appearance from other glial cells and were not counted towards total repo-positive cell counts (Figure 6D); instead, they were counted separately (Figure 6F). This rosette phenotype is absent at the R+0 time point in all conditions, whereas it is observed at the R+25 time point specifically after exposure to spaceflight-related stressors in a dose-dependent manner (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) (Figure 6F). We believe the rosette to be a phenotype manifested as a long-term effect of the spaceflight environment. The rosette formation could result from factors such as elevated CO2 levels and can be exacerbated by the combinatorial effect of other spaceflight stressors such as ionizing radiation and reduced gravity. While some of the immunohistochemical and omics results described here resemble early aging, more assays at additional time points need to be performed for further validation of the effect of spaceflight on related aging phenotypes. Although omics profiling at the R+25 time point would be informative and will be considered in future missions, these experiments were not feasible here since the flies were distributed for the other assays reported above. Taken together, the brain morphology at R+0 time point is similar in SF1g and Earth conditions, but as the flies age postflight under terrestrial conditions, the morphological deficits start manifesting in SF1g flies and are worsened over time in SFμg, suggesting a phenotype that is manifested after exposure to spaceflight.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars. Using MVP, a fruit fly space habitat, we provide insights into spaceflight effects on the brain at the molecular, morphological, and behavioral levels. While AG by rotation of the spacecraft is being considered as a potential countermeasure to μg, there is a gap in our understanding of AG prescriptions required to ameliorate the health concerns during spaceflight (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Mao et al., 2018a; Young, 1999). To address this knowledge gap, we utilized the MVP hardware featuring an inflight centrifuge that simulates Earth’s gravity on the ISS (SF1g). SF1g served two objectives: 1) assessment of the use of AG as a countermeasure; and 2) distinguishing the effects of μg from other spaceflight stressors, such as radiation. A key feature of the MVP hardware, the inflight video recording capability, aided in assessing the health of the flies during the mission and provided real-time data of behavioral alterations caused by the change in the gravitational environment. Due to the large number of videos taken on the mission, manual analysis by visual assessment was not feasible, nor was the use of specialized equipment traditionally used to assess fly behavior in ground laboratories (Chan et al., 2012; Inan et al., 2009, 2011; Kohlhoff et al., 2011; Slawson et al., 2009). Also, the constraints in video quality, such as uneven light distribution, inability to focus on flies in the foreground and the background, prevented the use of sophisticated tracking and machine learning algorithms for behavioral analysis. Therefore, a simple yet effective automated method was developed to quantitatively capture overall behavioral differences across spaceflight conditions. The overall level of activity of a population is a trait influenced by the environment and can be used to assess other physiological changes. Miller et al. suggested that fly hyperactivity in μg is a result of their innate negative geotactic response (Miller et al., 2002). Interestingly, our findings follow a similar trend, apart from the population flux point (day 20), we consistently observed that flies in SFμg are more active than those in SF1g (Figure 1D, E). This data suggests that AG may suppress the hyperactive behavior in flies during spaceflight. Similar increases in fly activity (Benguría et al., 1996) and mouse circling behavior (Ronca et al., 2019) in spaceflight conditions have been reported. Future improvements in the flight hardware might aid in quantifying individual fly activity, thus providing further insights into behavioral changes caused by gravity changes and the ability to test the effectiveness of countermeasures. A substantial fraction of the literature on the CNS effects of spaceflight focuses on either anatomical changes or molecular changes using omics platforms. In this study, we took a multimodal approach combining the morphological analysis with the omics-based molecular phenotyping for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with spaceflight-induced brain changes. At the transcriptomics level, we observed a higher number of differentially regulated genes in SFμg compared to Earth, specifically in females. Meanwhile, the SF1g females show fewer changes in RNA compared to Earth (Figure 3). Interestingly, at the proteomic level, the number of DEPs is relatively similar and show considerable overlap across spaceflight conditions (SF1g vs Earth and SFμg vs Earth). In many studies a discordance is observed between the two omics platforms; nevertheless, each data set offers unique insights into spaceflight-associated changes (Casas-Vila et al., 2017; De Sousa Abreu et al., 2009). While transcriptomic analyses provide broad-scale insights into molecular dynamics that occur on the level of mRNA regulation, most physiological processes are driven by protein function. Based on proteomics one important theme that was captured across both spaceflight conditions was a change in metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (Figures 3–5). These are consistent with previously published data on space-flown human kidney cells (Hammond et al., 2000) and mouse brain subjected to spaceflight (Mao et al., 2018b). The brain is a metabolically dynamic and high-energy-demanding organ that is dependent on mitochondria for deriving energy via various metabolic processes that converge at glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Hall et al., 2012; Magistretti and Allaman, 2015). Normal functioning of the brain requires a tight temporal and spatial regulation of metabolite supply for energy production (Roy and Sherrington, 1890; Watts et al., 2018). We observe such metabolic regulation in spaceflight flies with increased glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4E, H, I). Additionally, spaceflight flies exhibit alteration in proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP metabolism (Figure 4F, G), similar to the observations in mice, astronauts, and the NASA Twins Study (da Silveira et al., 2020). Such dysregulation of ETC and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D) can lead to mitochondrial and oxidative stress via ROS production (Bhatti et al., 2017). Oxidative stress during spaceflight is further evidenced by an increase in 8-oxo-dG, cellular oxidative stress marker, in the SFμg fly brain at R+0 time point (Figure 2E, I), and is consistent with the increase of 8-oxo-dG in urine and plasma samples in astronauts (Rai et al., 2011; da Silveira et al., 2020). On the contrary, SF1g brains at the R+0 time point showed no significant change in the 8-oxo-dG marker, thus suggesting that AG can suppress oxidative damage in the brain immediately after return from spaceflight (Figure 2E, I). We hypothesize that the observed alterations in the metabolic pathways are an effort to restore cellular homeostasis via metabolic reprogramming. While homeostasis is restored in R+0 SF1g, possibly due to AG, as evidenced by their similar brain morphology to Earth flies (Figure 2), microgravity in SFμg acts as an additional stressor, potentially resulting in elevated oxidative stress. This stress can further trigger a cascade of events leading to neuronal damage as noted in the behavioral deficits (Figure 2A), loss of DA neurons (Figure 2E, F), decreased neuronal cortex and neuropil areas (Figure 2B–D and Figure S3B), and increased apoptosis (Figure 2E, H) in SFμg flies. Additionally, we observe perturbations in synaptic transmission proteins during spaceflight (Figure 5C, D), which in combination with bioenergetic changes (Figure 4) can result in dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and synaptic degeneration (Mattson and Liu, 2002). Synaptic changes have also been documented in multiple spaceflight and ground-based rodent studies (Bondar, 2005; DeFelipe et al., 2002; Gaofei et al., 2009; Howe et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Ranjan et al., 2014; Ross and Varelas, 2005; Sokolova et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Neuronal damage and loss induced by elevated oxidative stress can potentially alter the glial response, initiating phagocytosis to clear neuronal debris (Block et al., 2007). While our observations of glial numbers immediately after return (R+0) shows an increasing trend in SFμg females and SF1g (females and males) (Figure 2G), further analysis is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of change in glial function. Collectively, our observations suggest that brain morphological changes due to spaceflightinduced oxidative stress are more pronounced in μg conditions, and AG can provide partial protection to these phenotypes. Based on our omics data, R+0 morphology, and the radiation levels on ISS, gravity seems to have a significant impact on the immediate phenotypes of spaceflight with larger observable changes in SFμg compared to SF1g. The environment experienced by the flies in SFμg compared to SF1g allows the comparison of gravity separately from the combined effect of the other spaceflight stressors like radiation, elevated CO2, and sound pressure which would equally impact both SF1g and SFμg. Although the morphological manifestations are not observed in SF1g flies at R+0 time point, with age (R+25), the phenotypes progressively present themselves in the form of increased apoptosis, neuronal loss, glial loss and aggregate formation (Figure 6AF). Glial loss may be attributed to the relocation of glia to the neuronal debris, thus resulting in aggregates (formation of rosettes), a phenotype specific to the spaceflight environment. These phenotypes in SF1g at R+25 may be a delayed response to radiation combined with exposure to other space stressors such as elevated CO2. Radiation studies in ground-based rodent models indicate that exposure to deep space radiation (galactic cosmic radiation or GCR) alone can affect behavior (Dutta et al., 2018; Euston et al., 2012; Parihar et al., 2015, 2018; Raber et al., 2018b), and neuronal phenotypes (Davis et al., 2015; Howe et al., 2019; Impey et al., 2016; Krukowski et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Raber et al., 2016, 2018b, 2019; Rabin et al., 2014; Whoolery et al., 2017). In an enclosed and isolated environment of the ISS, astronauts experience elevated CO2 levels that are considerably higher than ambient levels on Earth (Mahadevan et al., 2021). In our study, the Earth control flies were exposed to an environment mimicking ISS and experienced high CO2 levels similar to SF1g and SFμg flies, in contrast to regular lab conditions. Mild chronic hypercapnia due to constant exposure of elevated CO2 levels may contribute to the observed deficits of decreased TH positive cells, and repo positive rosettes (<10) in the Earth control flies at R+25, along with the increased cell death (CC3 positive cells) and DNA oxidation (8-oxo-dG positive cells) as noted at R+0 in Earth controls. In fact, in our ground-based study, we observed minimal cell death and DNA oxidation under normal terrestrial CO2 levels compared to Earth control brains from the MVP mission exposed to elevated CO2 levels (data not shown). Thus, the observations reported in the Earth controls are part of the unique spaceflight paradigm and may not be comparable to controls in terrestrial studies. While ground studies are important in separating the effects of individual space stressors, spaceflight studies are particularly relevant as we prepare for long-duration human missions to the Moon and Mars where there will be a combination of exposures to reduced gravity and doses of ionizing radiation that will be higher than in LEO (Mao et al., 2017; Straume et al., 2017). This study integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, morphological, and behavioral analyses to investigate the effects of spaceflight on Drosophila CNS both during and after return from spaceflight. Further, our study utilizes inflight centrifuge mimicking Earth 1g, as a control that allowed us to separate μg from the effects of other spaceflight environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Additionally, the postflight acclimation to Earth’s conditions is relevant to understanding the sustained effects of spaceflight on the CNS. Our integrated approach suggests that oxidative stress during spaceflight leads to differential regulation of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission resulting in neuronal deficits, glial changes, increased apoptosis, and behavioral impairments in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study indicates that μg is an important but not an exclusive environmental factor contributing to the neurobehavioral outcomes during long-term deep space missions. AG may provide a measure for short-term protection, but long-term solutions still need to be explored, especially for longduration missions in deep space. Earth’s magnetosphere partially protects against ionizing radiation from GCRs and solar particle events (SPE) in LEO, but beyond LEO, deep space irradiation will pose significant risks to crewmember health. Thus, along with AG, future countermeasure studies should target these pathways in model organisms that are amenable to large-scale screening in space. Limitations of the study: The opportunity to conduct spaceflight experiments is not only rare and expensive, but the logistical constraints of such studies also make them highly challenging to perform (Inokuchi et al., 2007; Rutter et al., 2020). For instance, the experiment launch and retrieval can be significantly altered due to weather or technical issues with the spacecraft, thus necessitating a flexible experimental design to achieve the intended science goals. In fact, our sample return was delayed from 31 days to 34 days due to weather-related issues. Another constraint of spaceflight studies is that retrieving exact age-matched flies is often not feasible. Some of the previous spaceflight studies have been conducted on mixed-age populations of flies from different generations (depending on the mission’s timeline). But with the MVP hardware, the astronauts could accommodate multiple timed inflight operations, including a 5.5-day egglay period (Figure S1C), thus ensuring that the retrieved flies were from the same generation and within a relatively close age range (11-17 days). Our strategy of testing randomly selected flies from this collection ensured that the average ages were similar and allowed for an unbiased comparison across groups of flies. Further, spaceflight experiments are severely limited by mass and volume. Therefore, the number of samples retrieved is limited by the capacity of the flight hardware. In this experiment, a large population of live flies were retrieved from the MVP hardware, allowing us to conduct the presented experiments. Additional flies would have allowed for longitudinal multi-omic profiling at the R+25 time point but were unavailable for this experiment. The current study, MVP-FLY-01 mission, was an important one-time validation flight for the MVP hardware to demonstrate its ability to support Drosophila research on the ISS. After its successful validation, as demonstrated by this experiment, this hardware will form the framework for multiple Drosophila spaceflight investigations in the future.",

We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.Introduction Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Grimm et al., 2016; Indo et al., 2016; Kononikhin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Clément et al., 2020, Salim, 2017, Friedman, 2011). Spanning over 60 years of research, the short-term impacts of spaceflight on the CNS have been investigated, but there is still insufficient data regarding its long-term health risks (Clément et al., 2020). Also, there are limitations to evaluating the impact of CNS damage in humans. Therefore, there is a need to leverage research approaches using animal models that would aid in cellular, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of CNS responses to spaceflight. Recent literature has established the fruit fly as a valuable model for understanding the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and radiation in the spaceflight environment (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikenaga et al., 1997; Marcu et al., 2011; Ogneva et al., 2016). With their small size, short generation time (~10 days), short lifespan (~60-80 days), large number of offspring, and low cost of rearing, flies mitigate many of the practical concerns stemming from performing long term, multigenerational studies in space. Here, we present the results of an International Space Station (ISS)-based study, MVPFly-01(Multi-use Variable-gravity Platform), to understand the effects of spaceflight on the fly nervous system and the value of artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure. AG is an attractive countermeasure, since it can potentially ameliorate the effect of microgravity (μg) on multiple physiological systems, by simulating Earth-like gravity (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Horie et al., 2019; Shiba et al., 2017; Young, 1999). We performed behavioral analyses, brain immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and transcriptomics on flies subjected to microgravity (SFμg), inflight artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g), and environmentally matched ground control (Earth). Our results showed inflight and postflight behavioral changes and morphological alterations in the brain immediately postflight in response to μg. Further, acclimation to Earth following spaceflight revealed brain morphological changes in both SF1g and SFμg flies, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg. These results, in combination with metabolic pathways altered in transcriptomic and proteomic studies on fly heads frozen on the ISS provide comprehensive information on the effects of inflight AG exposure on CNS and postflight acclimation to Earth conditions.Results The MVP-Fly-01 mission The ISS is a useful environment for studying the effects of spaceflight by combining a μg environment with ionizing radiation and CO2 levels that are elevated compared to Earth’s surface (McDonald et al., 2020). The MVP-Fly-01 validation mission (34 days) has enabled comprehensive investigations of the fly CNS (Figure 1A). The two inflight centrifuges in the MVP hardware allowed us to maintain one centrifuge at μg (SFμg) with the flies developing entirely in μg, while the other centrifuge simulated Earth’s gravitational force (SF1g) on ISS and acted as a high-fidelity on-orbit control for gravity. In other words, the spaceflown flies experienced identical environmental perturbations during take-off and landing, were maintained in identical hardware, similar gas composition, sound pressure levels, temperature, and radiation environments in space, but were reared either under a 1g force in space or in μg. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control experiment was performed on Earth (Earth) using the same flight hardware and precisely simulating spaceflight conditions. The flies retrieved upon completion of the mission were used for behavioral, morphological, and acclimation analyses to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS (Figure 1B). Figure 1: Inflight behavioral analysis shows hyperactivity in microgravity. Open in a new tab (A) Schematic of MVP-Fly01 mission outline depicting the 34-days mission on ISS. Camera represents inflight videos that were recorded to monitor fly health and behavior. Onboard operations included freezing the food cylinders containing flies and larvae in RNAlater for omics analysis. Live flies were returned to Earth. Following the telemetry and timeline of the mission, matched Earth controls were performed (Earth). (B) Experimental timeline highlighting the onboard operations and postflight R+0 and R+25 assays.

The white tracks represent flies that moved at any point during the recording. (D) Fly activity mapped overtime for 16 days (mission day 13-28). Each row represents one adult fly chamber in an individual MVP module, and across from left to right is a temporal progression with every six rectangles (each rectangle = 28s video recording) spanning a single 12-hr light period. The color bar represents the activity level from a minimum background intensity (dark blue) to the highest activity level intensity (bright green). Top six rows correspond to SF1g flies and bottom five to SFμg flies. (E) Line graphs show increased activity levels across mission day 13-28 averaged over each day across modules for each population set (n=5-73). *p<0.05.SFμg flies exhibit increased activity on ISS We developed an automated quantification algorithm that computes the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of video recordings of fly behavior (represented in Videos S1 and S2) during spaceflight and sums pixel intensities to produce numerical values representative of fly activity levels (higher numerical values correlate with high fly activity), accounting for both the emergence of flies and their movement during the 12-hr light period (Figure 1C). Since the fly population sizes in adult fly chamber 1 were not statistically different between SF1g and SFμg (Figure S2), any difference in MIP intensity between these two groups reflected differences in fly activity. We generated a color map showing the relative numerical activity in adult fly chamber 1 as a function of mission timeline (days 13-28) for each module grouped as either SF1g or SFμg (Figure 1D). Upon quantification, we found that the overall activity level of the SF1g flies is significantly below SFμg flies (Figure 1E). On mission day 20 and 28, there is no distinguishable difference in the activity for the two gravity levels. This is possibly due to the initial emergence of flies into the adult fly chamber around day 20 that causes a similar increase in activity in both SF1g and SFμg environments. On day 28, the high density of flies in both conditions may result in close proximity of the flies, thereby increasing their activity levels. The results show that within the closely matched fly populations maintained in spaceflight, flies exposed to μg conditions show significantly greater levels of activity than their 1g counterparts.Flies exposed to microgravity conditions show behavioral and neuronal deficits, glial alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis Upon landing, a subset of F1 flies were first used for behavioral assays to measure climbing ability. Climbing ability is the fly’s innate negative geotactic response and is routinely used to assess nervous system dysfunction in fly models (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Iijima et al., 2004). This behavior relies on the integrity of the connection between the brain and muscles. Specifically, it involves the mushroom body, which is the part of the brain that regulates the transition from rest to responsiveness in relation to environmental stressors (Martin et al., 1998). To capture the sexually dimorphic responses, we assessed males and females separately in our analysis. We observed that males born in μg were more affected with significant deficits in climbing ability compared to Earth males (Figure 2A). A decreasing trend was also observed in SFμg females and SF1g (males and females) compared to their respective Earth control. Additionally, we noted a significant decrease in climbing ability in SFμg males compared to SFμg females. This result is consistent with the previously observed reduction in postflight climbing response in males exposed to μg (Benguría et al., 1996).

(B) Representative image of fly brain stained with neuronal marker, anti-ELAV; neuronal cortex marked by the dashed outer white line and neuropil marked by the dashed inner yellow line. Quantification shows decrease in neuronal cortex area (C) and neuropil area (D) in SFμg compared to both Earth and SF1g controls (n=10-14). (E) Representative images of fly brains labeled with anti-TH (green), anti-REPO (red), anti-CC3 (white), and anti-8-oxo-dG (cyan). Quantification showed significant loss in DA neurons (F) (n=6-9) and alterations in glial numbers (G) (n=5-9), apoptosis (H) (n=5-7), and oxidative DNA damage (I) (n=5-7) in SFμg condition. Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the histogram. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.We then dissected the adult fly brains and stained them with neuronal (anti-ELAV) (Figure 2B), apoptotic (anti-CC3), and oxidative stress-associated DNA damage (anti-8-oxo-dG) (Figure 2E) markers. Upon quantification, we observed a slight yet significant reduction in the total brain area of SFμg female flies compared to both Earth and SF1g females; males showed no change in brain sizes (Figure S3A). Morphological quantification with anti-ELAV staining showed a significant decrease in neuronal cortex area (Figure 2B, C, and S3B) in SFμg flies compared to Earth and SF1g control flies in both sexes. Similarly, the neuropil area is significantly reduced in SFμg compared to Earth flies (Figure 2D). A similar phenotype was noted in the Alzheimer’s disease fly model accompanied with behavioral deficits (Mhatre et al., 2014). No significant differences in neuronal cortex and neuropil areas were observed in SF1g compared to Earth flies (Figure 2C, D). A marked increase in CC3 positive apoptotic puncta (Figure 2E, H) and 8-oxo-dG positive cells (Figure 2E, I) was observed in flies subjected to SFμg as compared to Earth and SF1g controls. Apoptotic cells were detected throughout the brain, and many of them colocalized with the ELAV marker (Figure S3Cv). Additionally, all the 8-oxo-dG positive cells colocalize with neuronal ELAV marker, suggesting oxidative damage in neuronal cells (Figure S3Civ, marked with green arrowhead). The observed oxidative stress response has been documented in previous spaceflight and ground-based altered gravity studies in mice and flies (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016, 2018b, 2020; da Silveira et al., 2020). Another subset of brains was stained with glial (anti-Repo), and dopaminergic neuron (anti-TH) (Figure 2E) markers. Gross analysis of the total number of dopaminergic (DA) neurons revealed a reduction in DA neuron count in SFμg compared to SF1g and Earth fly brains in both sexes (Figure 2E, F). Like the climbing behavior, we observed significantly lowered DA neurons in SFμg males compared to SFμg females suggesting sensitivity of male flies to μg. DA neurons are involved in locomotion, and the lack of these neurons have been identified in the development of Parkinson’s disease in humans (Ryczko and Dubuc, 2017). We also observed a significant increase in DA neurons in SF1g males compared to the Earth males; this may be part of a phenotype resulting from exposure to a 1g centrifugal force on flies that are also perturbed by a combination of spaceflight stressors - ionizing radiation and elevated CO2 levels. In the case of glia, SFμg females and SF1g (both males and females) displayed an increasing trend in glial cell number compared to Earth controls. However, the SFμg males showed a decreasing trend in the glial population compared to Earth males (Figure 2E, G), and a significant reduction in the glial population compared to SF1g males. Further experiments are necessary to study the sex specificity of the spaceflight effects and the underlying mechanisms contributing to these differences in glial cell populations. The SF1g and Earth flies were exposed to similar temperature, humidity, CO2, and sound pressure levels, however, ionizing radiation was an additional spaceflight stressor experienced by the SF1g flies compared to the Earth flies. Thus, the similarity in morphological phenotype between SF1g and Earth control flies in many of the readouts analyzed here, including behavior, neuronal cortex and neuropil areas, apoptosis, and oxidative damage (Figure 2), suggests that radiation alone may not be a significant contributing factor for the immediate postflight CNS effects of spaceflight. However, ionizing radiation may contribute to some of the long-term effects of spaceflight on the CNS and are discussed further in a later section. The entire experiment occurred over a short duration (34 days) and the radiation environment in LEO is known to be more benign than the environment in deep space, beyond the Van Allen belts (Nelson, 2016). Therefore, the gross physiological changes induced in LEO flights like on ISS, as observed in SFμg flies, at least for the CNS immediately post-return, may primarily be associated with changes in gravity. Thus, these results indicate that gravity can play a key role in the LEO environment, causing neuronal and neurobehavioral deficits during spaceflight.Global omics analysis highlights spaceflight induced altered genes and proteins in the brain Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed on the heads of flies which developed entirely on ISS under SFμg or SF1g conditions and Earth controls (Figure 3A). RNAseq on heads from SFμg flies compared with Earth controls showed differential expression of 1014 genes in females and 507 genes in males, while proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 577 proteins in females and 719 proteins in males. RNAseq in SF1g flies compared to Earth reared flies showed differential expression of 80 genes in females and 601 genes in males, and proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 389 proteins in females and 425 proteins in males (Figure 3A). Overall, these results suggest alterations in transcripts and protein levels when flies are reared in space conditions compared to Earth condition. A full list of DEGs and DEPs is provided in Supplementary data (.xls 1 and 2). Further, to understand the overlap across the transcriptomics and proteomics as well as across the different experimental conditions, we generated an UpSet diagram displaying top 30 intersections (Figure 3B). The overlap between the DEGs (orange dots and bars) and DEPs (green dots and bars) for the experimental conditions is shown, and across DEGs and DEPs are marked in black. Also shown are the genes and proteins unique to each condition (grey dots and bars). The intersection within DEPs across experimental conditions yields more hits compared to DEGs. This is evidenced by 167 significantly altered proteins (adj. p-value < 0.05), compared to 25 significantly altered genes (adj. p-value<0.05) in SF1g and SFμg conditions compared to Earth controls (Figures 3B and S4A, B). The observed overlapping DEPs and DEGs are potential spaceflight signatures irrespective of gravity that can be further investigated. Additionally, though we observe minimal overlap across both transcriptomic and proteomic platform, the common processes possibly share a transcriptional mechanism of dysregulation, hence making these processes central towards the phenotype manifested in spaceflight flies. For example, as shown in the case of SFμg female compared to Earth female, the gene ontology (GO) analysis of overlapping DEPs and DEGs (65) revealed enrichment of key biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) that closely regulate mitochondrial functions, metabolic processes, immune response, and synaptic signaling, among others (Figure S4C).

Table provides a global view of the total number of differentially up and down regulated genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. (B) Upset plot displays top 30 intersections across omics platforms and between conditions (SF1g males, SF1g females, SFμg males, SFμg females). The purple horizontal bars indicate the total number of DEGs and DEPs identified in each condition.

(C) Dot plot representing top 20 significantly (adj.p-value <0.05) enriched gene ontology (GO) terms in biological processes in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. SF1g female RNA compared to Earth control did not have any enriched GO biological processes, hence not represented in the dot plot. The color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio.Focused analysis reveals differential alteration in metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation in space reared flies The spaceflight conditions (SF1g and SFμg) compared to Earth were analyzed across the omics platforms. Figure 3C highlights the top 20 significantly enriched GO biological processes, including cuticle development, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, metabolic processes, response to heat, protein folding, neurotransmitter secretion, synaptic vesicle signaling, and retinal homeostasis, among others. The enrichment is more evident in proteins compared to RNA. The complete list from GO enrichment analysis (BP, CC, MF) is provided in Supplementary.xls 1 and 2. Further, we note a sexually dimorphic response in the transcriptomic dataset, which is not observed in proteomics analysis (Figure S5). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the proteomics dataset across conditions revealed sexual dimorphism at the pathway enrichment level (more KEGG pathway enrichment in females than males), which was more evident in SF1g than SFμg condition. Proteomic data of SFμg flies (males and females) show enrichment of pathways such as endocytosis, cellular metabolic responsive pathways – tyrosine metabolism, sucrose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, glutamate metabolism, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4A). These metabolic pathways play critical roles in cellular as well as mitochondrial homeostasis. The metabolic reprogramming under spaceflight conditions suggests metabolic and cellular stress, similar to that observed in cancer and aging (Brooks Robey et al., 2015; Wallace, 2005). Similar regulation of metabolic pathways is observed in other spaceflight-based mammalian studies, including humans (GarrettBakelman et al., 2019b; de Luca et al., 2009; da Silveira et al., 2020; Stein, 2002). Analysis of cellular respiration revealed perturbations in the biological processes and cellular components encompassing every step of the pathway, i.e., glucose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle (TCA), and electron transport chain as well as at mitochondrial organelle level (Figure 4B, C). This is observed in both spaceflight conditions but is more pronounced in SFμg than SF1g (both sexes), suggesting differential regulation under the spaceflight stress ± gravity vector. Figure 4: Metabolic pathways and cellular respiration affected by spaceflight. Open in a new tab (A) Dot plot representing the KEGG pathways (p<0.05) enriched in DEPs across different conditions.

The color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. (D-F) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins (D), glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism proteins (E), and proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation (F) in SF1g and SFμg vs. Earth. (G) Differentially expressed proteins (in red) in SFμg females (vs. Earth females) are mapped onto the oxidative phosphorylation KEGG pathway using KEGG mapper. (H-I) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change] of proteins that are significantly expressed (adj. p-value<0.05) in fatty acid metabolism (H), and amino acid metabolism (I), with red representing upregulated and blue for downregulated.At the mitochondrial level, an increase in PGAM5 and mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins such as dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and OPA1 were observed, suggesting increased mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D). We observed the upregulation of many enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as hexokinase C (HEXC) and Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP) (Figure 4E), suggesting increased glycolytic flux (Tanner et al., 2018). Meanwhile, we observed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting funneling of glycolysis products towards lactate production under spaceflight conditions. Another key enzyme, AcCoAS, is downregulated, thereby reducing the production of Acetyl-CoA, a key enzyme required for the TCA cycle. Further, modulation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation/ETC is noted (Figure 4F). While ETC proteins are differentially regulated under both SF1g and SFμg conditions, the number of proteins regulated under SFμg is more than the SF1g condition. In fact, differential regulation of at least one protein associated with each of the five ETC complexes is observed under SFμg conditions (Figure 4G), which may contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, KEGG pathway enrichment shows differential regulation of fatty acid metabolism as well as amino acid metabolism. We observed an upregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid (Figure 4H) and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4I), suggesting high energy demand, thereby emphasizing cellular stress response under spaceflight conditions (SFμg> SF1g).Spaceflight alters the expression of stress-inducible proteins affecting CNS During spaceflight, metabolic pathways are altered along with the biological processes associated with cellular stress, including response to heat, response to ROS, ROS metabolic process, and cellular homeostasis, thus indicating increased cellular stress (Figure 5A). We see significant upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs): HSP70AB, HSP26, HSP23, HSP27, and HSP67BC in both spaceflight conditions (Figure 5B). HSPs are the molecular chaperones with cytoprotective properties that are induced in response to a variety of cellular insults such as heat, radiation, oxidative stress, and altered gravity, to confer protection against deteriorating effects of ROS (Bukau et al., 2006; Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikwegbue et al., 2018). Low amounts of ROS aid in neuronal development and function, but oxidative stress-induced excessive ROS levels lead to cellular damage, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and altered brain morphology, causing neuroinflammation and neuronal death (Gu, 2011). Our observations of increased neuronal loss, apoptosis and oxidative damage in the fly brain further confirm the effects of oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figure 2). These morphological defects in the brain correlate with the altered expression of proteins that are enriched in functions such as neuronal projection, neuron death, axonogenesis, and synaptic transmission in SFμg flies compared to Earth (Figure 5C). Figure 5: Increased cellular stress affects neuronal signaling in spaceflight. Open in a new tab (A) Dot plot showing enriched GO terms (adj. p-value<0.05) associated with cellular stress in biological processes and molecular function for SF1g and SFμg (DEPs) compared to Earth. (B) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) cellular stress response proteins. (C) Dot plot highlighting enriched GO terms (p<0.05) associated with neuronal and synaptic signaling in biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components across all conditions (DEPs). (D) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change of proteins that are significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) in synaptic transmission. For dot plot, the color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. For heatmap, the red color represents upregulated and blue shows downregulated proteins.In terms of neuronal functioning, we observed modulations in proteins involved in synaptic transmission across all spaceflight conditions (Figure 5D). For instance, SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (SYX1A), syntaxin binding protein SNAP24, presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin (SYT), presynaptic calcium signaling protein P32, endocytic fission protein dynamin (SHI), and endocytic coat protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) are downregulated. Meanwhile, the vesicle-mediated transport protein GDI, NSF1 protein that aids in disassembly of SNARE complex (COMT), cell-cell adhesion mediator protein FAS2, vesicular trafficking protein ARF79F, and synapsin (SYN), a phosphoprotein associated with synaptic vesicles, among others are upregulated. These proteins collectively encompass almost every step of the synaptic vesicle cycle. The number of proteins altered is higher in SFμg condition than SF1g, and within SFμg condition, males show more changes than females, further reinforcing the selective sensitivity towards males and a dose-dependent response across spaceflight condition. Additionally, proteins associated with muscle and cytoskeleton are also noted in spaceflight flies (SFμg> SF1g) (Figure S5 C,D), consistent with previous spaceflight findings (Ogneva et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2020).Persistent effects of exposure to spaceflight Proteomics analysis suggests enrichment of behavioral and aging markers in SF1g and SFμg flies (Figure S6A). Specifically, the upregulation of HSP26, HSP27, HSP68, MTPalpha, CAT, SM, and TRXR-1, LDH, and downregulation of DJ-1beta, MSRA, and LEVY is observed across all conditions (Figure S6B). These proteins are also associated with oxidative stress response, which has been shown to increase with age (Lavara-Culebras and Paricio, 2007; Liao et al., 2008; Long et al., 2020a; Ren et al., 2017). To further understand the effects of spaceflight as the flies acclimate to Earth’s gravity, we aged the flies for 25 days post-return under terrestrial conditions (R+25 days). Figure S7 shows the observed changes at R+25 timepoint for DA neuron counts, neuronal cortex area, apoptosis, and glial phenotypes. Overall, at the R+25 timepoint, the brain morphology of SF1g and SFμg is altered compared to Earth controls with sex-specific changes observed in the neuronal cortex area (Figure S7). We then performed the longitudinal comparison of morphological changes in fly brains between the R+0 (11-17 days old) and R+25 (36-42 days old) time points. This paradigm is similar to the post-mission evaluation of astronauts as they acclimate to Earth conditions over a period of time. Significant reduction of DA neurons was observed early in SFμg flies at the R+0 time point, compared to the gradual loss of these neurons in Earth and SF1g flies at the R+25 time point (Figure 6A). Typically, terrestrial conditions have not been associated with age-related loss of DA neurons (White et al., 2010), however, the elevated levels of CO2 in Earth flies (analogous to SF1g and SFμg) in this study may contribute to the observed loss of DA neurons as the flies age in the Earth controls. Further, comparison of neuronal cortex areas between R+0 and R+25 data showed no change in the Earth flies, while decreasing trend over time was noted in SF1g flies and a significant reduction in SFμg flies, thus suggesting increased neuronal loss with age in space reared flies (Figure 6B). This loss correlates with increased apoptosis observed in R+25 flies, both SF1g (39%) and SFμg (70%) compared to R+25 Earth flies (Figure 6C). This progressive increase in apoptosis in space-reared flies (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) may suggest a dose-dependent response in flies as we move from Earth to space conditions with exposure to multiple stressors, including increased ionizing radiation combined with exposure to reduced gravity. Figure 6: Persistent effects of spaceflight. Open in a new tab (A-D) Stacked bar plots showing quantification of DA neurons (A) (n=5-10), neuronal cortex area (B) (n=10-14), apoptosis (C) (n=5-7), and glia (D) at R+0 and R+25 days. (E) Representative images of R+25 fly brains labeled with anti-REPO (red). Quantification of Repo positive cells at R+25 days showed total glial loss (D) and increase in the aggregates/rosettes (F) (white box in E inset) in SFμg, SF1g (n=6-9). Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the stacked bar plots. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.Additionally, we assessed glia, the primary phagocytic cell in CNS that are required to clear oxidative stress-induced neuronal debris (Bilimoria and Stevens, 2015; Casano and Peri, 2015; Cronk and Kipnis, 2013; Cunningham, 2013; Freeman, 2006; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007). At R+25, while we observe a slight but non-significant increase in glial cell numbers under Earth conditions (females: 7%, males: 17%), a significant depletion of the glial population in Earth acclimated SF1g (females: 56%, males: 59%), and sex-specific depletion in SFμg flies (females: 54%, males: 33%) is noted compared to their respective R+0 timepoint (Figure 6D, E). This depletion of the glial population can be due to burdening of the clearance system, eventually leading to glial apoptosis (Block et al., 2007), but additional investigation is warranted. Furthermore, as the flies age, we observe aggregates of glial cells that resemble rosettes (Figure 6E, inset). These rosettes were distinct in size and appearance from other glial cells and were not counted towards total repo-positive cell counts (Figure 6D); instead, they were counted separately (Figure 6F). This rosette phenotype is absent at the R+0 time point in all conditions, whereas it is observed at the R+25 time point specifically after exposure to spaceflight-related stressors in a dose-dependent manner (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) (Figure 6F). We believe the rosette to be a phenotype manifested as a long-term effect of the spaceflight environment. The rosette formation could result from factors such as elevated CO2 levels and can be exacerbated by the combinatorial effect of other spaceflight stressors such as ionizing radiation and reduced gravity. While some of the immunohistochemical and omics results described here resemble early aging, more assays at additional time points need to be performed for further validation of the effect of spaceflight on related aging phenotypes. Although omics profiling at the R+25 time point would be informative and will be considered in future missions, these experiments were not feasible here since the flies were distributed for the other assays reported above. Taken together, the brain morphology at R+0 time point is similar in SF1g and Earth conditions, but as the flies age postflight under terrestrial conditions, the morphological deficits start manifesting in SF1g flies and are worsened over time in SFμg, suggesting a phenotype that is manifested after exposure to spaceflight.Discussion Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars. Using MVP, a fruit fly space habitat, we provide insights into spaceflight effects on the brain at the molecular, morphological, and behavioral levels. While AG by rotation of the spacecraft is being considered as a potential countermeasure to μg, there is a gap in our understanding of AG prescriptions required to ameliorate the health concerns during spaceflight (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Mao et al., 2018a; Young, 1999). To address this knowledge gap, we utilized the MVP hardware featuring an inflight centrifuge that simulates Earth’s gravity on the ISS (SF1g). SF1g served two objectives: 1) assessment of the use of AG as a countermeasure; and 2) distinguishing the effects of μg from other spaceflight stressors, such as radiation. A key feature of the MVP hardware, the inflight video recording capability, aided in assessing the health of the flies during the mission and provided real-time data of behavioral alterations caused by the change in the gravitational environment. Due to the large number of videos taken on the mission, manual analysis by visual assessment was not feasible, nor was the use of specialized equipment traditionally used to assess fly behavior in ground laboratories (Chan et al., 2012; Inan et al., 2009, 2011; Kohlhoff et al., 2011; Slawson et al., 2009). Also, the constraints in video quality, such as uneven light distribution, inability to focus on flies in the foreground and the background, prevented the use of sophisticated tracking and machine learning algorithms for behavioral analysis. Therefore, a simple yet effective automated method was developed to quantitatively capture overall behavioral differences across spaceflight conditions. The overall level of activity of a population is a trait influenced by the environment and can be used to assess other physiological changes. Miller et al. suggested that fly hyperactivity in μg is a result of their innate negative geotactic response (Miller et al., 2002). Interestingly, our findings follow a similar trend, apart from the population flux point (day 20), we consistently observed that flies in SFμg are more active than those in SF1g (Figure 1D, E). This data suggests that AG may suppress the hyperactive behavior in flies during spaceflight. Similar increases in fly activity (Benguría et al., 1996) and mouse circling behavior (Ronca et al., 2019) in spaceflight conditions have been reported. Future improvements in the flight hardware might aid in quantifying individual fly activity, thus providing further insights into behavioral changes caused by gravity changes and the ability to test the effectiveness of countermeasures. A substantial fraction of the literature on the CNS effects of spaceflight focuses on either anatomical changes or molecular changes using omics platforms. In this study, we took a multimodal approach combining the morphological analysis with the omics-based molecular phenotyping for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with spaceflight-induced brain changes. At the transcriptomics level, we observed a higher number of differentially regulated genes in SFμg compared to Earth, specifically in females. Meanwhile, the SF1g females show fewer changes in RNA compared to Earth (Figure 3). Interestingly, at the proteomic level, the number of DEPs is relatively similar and show considerable overlap across spaceflight conditions (SF1g vs Earth and SFμg vs Earth). In many studies a discordance is observed between the two omics platforms; nevertheless, each data set offers unique insights into spaceflight-associated changes (Casas-Vila et al., 2017; De Sousa Abreu et al., 2009). While transcriptomic analyses provide broad-scale insights into molecular dynamics that occur on the level of mRNA regulation, most physiological processes are driven by protein function. Based on proteomics one important theme that was captured across both spaceflight conditions was a change in metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (Figures 3–5). These are consistent with previously published data on space-flown human kidney cells (Hammond et al., 2000) and mouse brain subjected to spaceflight (Mao et al., 2018b). The brain is a metabolically dynamic and high-energy-demanding organ that is dependent on mitochondria for deriving energy via various metabolic processes that converge at glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Hall et al., 2012; Magistretti and Allaman, 2015). Normal functioning of the brain requires a tight temporal and spatial regulation of metabolite supply for energy production (Roy and Sherrington, 1890; Watts et al., 2018). We observe such metabolic regulation in spaceflight flies with increased glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4E, H, I). Additionally, spaceflight flies exhibit alteration in proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP metabolism (Figure 4F, G), similar to the observations in mice, astronauts, and the NASA Twins Study (da Silveira et al., 2020). Such dysregulation of ETC and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D) can lead to mitochondrial and oxidative stress via ROS production (Bhatti et al., 2017). Oxidative stress during spaceflight is further evidenced by an increase in 8-oxo-dG, cellular oxidative stress marker, in the SFμg fly brain at R+0 time point (Figure 2E, I), and is consistent with the increase of 8-oxo-dG in urine and plasma samples in astronauts (Rai et al., 2011; da Silveira et al., 2020). On the contrary, SF1g brains at the R+0 time point showed no significant change in the 8-oxo-dG marker, thus suggesting that AG can suppress oxidative damage in the brain immediately after return from spaceflight (Figure 2E, I). We hypothesize that the observed alterations in the metabolic pathways are an effort to restore cellular homeostasis via metabolic reprogramming. While homeostasis is restored in R+0 SF1g, possibly due to AG, as evidenced by their similar brain morphology to Earth flies (Figure 2), microgravity in SFμg acts as an additional stressor, potentially resulting in elevated oxidative stress. This stress can further trigger a cascade of events leading to neuronal damage as noted in the behavioral deficits (Figure 2A), loss of DA neurons (Figure 2E, F), decreased neuronal cortex and neuropil areas (Figure 2B–D and Figure S3B), and increased apoptosis (Figure 2E, H) in SFμg flies. Additionally, we observe perturbations in synaptic transmission proteins during spaceflight (Figure 5C, D), which in combination with bioenergetic changes (Figure 4) can result in dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and synaptic degeneration (Mattson and Liu, 2002). Synaptic changes have also been documented in multiple spaceflight and ground-based rodent studies (Bondar, 2005; DeFelipe et al., 2002; Gaofei et al., 2009; Howe et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Ranjan et al., 2014; Ross and Varelas, 2005; Sokolova et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Neuronal damage and loss induced by elevated oxidative stress can potentially alter the glial response, initiating phagocytosis to clear neuronal debris (Block et al., 2007). While our observations of glial numbers immediately after return (R+0) shows an increasing trend in SFμg females and SF1g (females and males) (Figure 2G), further analysis is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of change in glial function. Collectively, our observations suggest that brain morphological changes due to spaceflightinduced oxidative stress are more pronounced in μg conditions, and AG can provide partial protection to these phenotypes. Based on our omics data, R+0 morphology, and the radiation levels on ISS, gravity seems to have a significant impact on the immediate phenotypes of spaceflight with larger observable changes in SFμg compared to SF1g. The environment experienced by the flies in SFμg compared to SF1g allows the comparison of gravity separately from the combined effect of the other spaceflight stressors like radiation, elevated CO2, and sound pressure which would equally impact both SF1g and SFμg. Although the morphological manifestations are not observed in SF1g flies at R+0 time point, with age (R+25), the phenotypes progressively present themselves in the form of increased apoptosis, neuronal loss, glial loss and aggregate formation (Figure 6AF). Glial loss may be attributed to the relocation of glia to the neuronal debris, thus resulting in aggregates (formation of rosettes), a phenotype specific to the spaceflight environment. These phenotypes in SF1g at R+25 may be a delayed response to radiation combined with exposure to other space stressors such as elevated CO2. Radiation studies in ground-based rodent models indicate that exposure to deep space radiation (galactic cosmic radiation or GCR) alone can affect behavior (Dutta et al., 2018; Euston et al., 2012; Parihar et al., 2015, 2018; Raber et al., 2018b), and neuronal phenotypes (Davis et al., 2015; Howe et al., 2019; Impey et al., 2016; Krukowski et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Raber et al., 2016, 2018b, 2019; Rabin et al., 2014; Whoolery et al., 2017). In an enclosed and isolated environment of the ISS, astronauts experience elevated CO2 levels that are considerably higher than ambient levels on Earth (Mahadevan et al., 2021). In our study, the Earth control flies were exposed to an environment mimicking ISS and experienced high CO2 levels similar to SF1g and SFμg flies, in contrast to regular lab conditions. Mild chronic hypercapnia due to constant exposure of elevated CO2 levels may contribute to the observed deficits of decreased TH positive cells, and repo positive rosettes (<10) in the Earth control flies at R+25, along with the increased cell death (CC3 positive cells) and DNA oxidation (8-oxo-dG positive cells) as noted at R+0 in Earth controls. In fact, in our ground-based study, we observed minimal cell death and DNA oxidation under normal terrestrial CO2 levels compared to Earth control brains from the MVP mission exposed to elevated CO2 levels (data not shown). Thus, the observations reported in the Earth controls are part of the unique spaceflight paradigm and may not be comparable to controls in terrestrial studies. While ground studies are important in separating the effects of individual space stressors, spaceflight studies are particularly relevant as we prepare for long-duration human missions to the Moon and Mars where there will be a combination of exposures to reduced gravity and doses of ionizing radiation that will be higher than in LEO (Mao et al., 2017; Straume et al., 2017). This study integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, morphological, and behavioral analyses to investigate the effects of spaceflight on Drosophila CNS both during and after return from spaceflight. Further, our study utilizes inflight centrifuge mimicking Earth 1g, as a control that allowed us to separate μg from the effects of other spaceflight environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Additionally, the postflight acclimation to Earth’s conditions is relevant to understanding the sustained effects of spaceflight on the CNS. Our integrated approach suggests that oxidative stress during spaceflight leads to differential regulation of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission resulting in neuronal deficits, glial changes, increased apoptosis, and behavioral impairments in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study indicates that μg is an important but not an exclusive environmental factor contributing to the neurobehavioral outcomes during long-term deep space missions. AG may provide a measure for short-term protection, but long-term solutions still need to be explored, especially for longduration missions in deep space. Earth’s magnetosphere partially protects against ionizing radiation from GCRs and solar particle events (SPE) in LEO, but beyond LEO, deep space irradiation will pose significant risks to crewmember health. Thus, along with AG, future countermeasure studies should target these pathways in model organisms that are amenable to large-scale screening in space. Limitations of the study: The opportunity to conduct spaceflight experiments is not only rare and expensive, but the logistical constraints of such studies also make them highly challenging to perform (Inokuchi et al., 2007; Rutter et al., 2020). For instance, the experiment launch and retrieval can be significantly altered due to weather or technical issues with the spacecraft, thus necessitating a flexible experimental design to achieve the intended science goals. In fact, our sample return was delayed from 31 days to 34 days due to weather-related issues. Another constraint of spaceflight studies is that retrieving exact age-matched flies is often not feasible. Some of the previous spaceflight studies have been conducted on mixed-age populations of flies from different generations (depending on the mission’s timeline). But with the MVP hardware, the astronauts could accommodate multiple timed inflight operations, including a 5.5-day egglay period (Figure S1C), thus ensuring that the retrieved flies were from the same generation and within a relatively close age range (11-17 days). Our strategy of testing randomly selected flies from this collection ensured that the average ages were similar and allowed for an unbiased comparison across groups of flies. Further, spaceflight experiments are severely limited by mass and volume. Therefore, the number of samples retrieved is limited by the capacity of the flight hardware. In this experiment, a large population of live flies were retrieved from the MVP hardware, allowing us to conduct the presented experiments. Additional flies would have allowed for longitudinal multi-omic profiling at the R+25 time point but were unavailable for this experiment. The current study, MVP-FLY-01 mission, was an important one-time validation flight for the MVP hardware to demonstrate its ability to support Drosophila research on the ISS. After its successful validation, as demonstrated by this experiment, this hardware will form the framework for multiple Drosophila spaceflight investigations in the future.STAR Methods RESOURCE AVAILABILITY Lead Contact Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Sharmila Bhattacharya (sharmila.bhattacharya@nasa.gov).Materials availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS A. Spaceflight mission and Hardware Description The MVP-Fly01 mission (Figure 1A, B) was launched on SpaceX-14 to the ISS at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Flies were kept in the MVP hardware throughout the 34-day mission on the ISS (Figure S1A). The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean was the same day at 20:00 UTC. The mission used the MVP hardware (Redwire/Techshot, Inc., Greenville, Indiana) that supports easy food changes, allowing for a large population of flies to be maintained over multiple generations. It is also equipped with UI-1491LE video cameras used to capture time course footage of D. melanogaster (Figure S1B). The hardware consists of uniform white LED illumination which was programmed for a 12-hr:12-hr (light: dark) cycle for each habitat. Fresh cabin air was continuously circulated through the habitat to maintain steady CO2 and O2 levels. The housing system consists of two independent centrifuge units maintained within the same habitat enclosure, each containing six MVP modules (Figure S1A, B). For this experiment, one centrifuge was rotated at 68 rpm to artificially simulate Earth’s gravity (SF1g) in space. The other centrifuge was rotated at 2.2 rpm, making the g-level at the outer edge of the carousel at approximately 0.00095g (SFμg). This minimal rotation of SFμg ensured temperature uniformity between all experimental modules, while maintaining the microgravity levels of the ISS. Each MVP module has two adult fly chambers and three food cylinders (Figure S1B). Each food cylinder holds approximately 9.2 mL of standard fly food (Gilbert et al., 2020) containing foodgrade blue food dye. The presence of the dye allowed for the differentiation between early and late third instar larvae during postflight specimen sorting. Its inclusion is not relevant to the current analysis of adult flies performed here. The hardware design allowed for the passage of two generations of flies sequentially from adult fly chamber 2 to adult fly chamber 1 (Figure S1B). The MVP hardware has video imaging capabilities, and 28-second video footage of the adult fly chambers was taken regularly throughout the 12-hr light period. Although the MVP hardware has night video recording capability, it was not utilized in this mission due to technical difficulties with the infrared lighting. Each 28-second video consisted of 368 frames with an image resolution of 1986×1064 pixels. This video was periodically checked during the mission to ensure the health of flies and gauge the overall well-being. Upon return, this video was analyzed for inflight behavior to compute adult fly activity in SF1g and SFμg conditions during the mission. Following the completion of the mission, the samples were returned to Port of Long Beach, California, and transported via a climate-controlled vehicle to NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), California, within 7 hours of landing. Temperature and humidity loggers were also programmed to monitor the samples throughout the journey. All dissections, fixation of brain tissue, and postflight behavioral analysis (described below) were performed within 24 hours of arrival at NASA ARC (Return+0 days = R+0). A small subset of flies separated by sex was placed in an incubator at 24°C for acclimation to earth condition for 25 days (Return+25 days = R+25), and the brains from these flies were processed for immunohistochemical analysis similar to R+0 flies (Figure 1B). During the mission, a small set consisting of only two MVP modules (synchronous control) was reared in a ground-based incubator with real-time changes in temperature, humidity, and CO2 matching the telemetry recorded on the ISS. The synchronous control was checked periodically to ensure the overall health of the flies during the mission but was not used for any of the postflight analysis. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control with the same hardware used for the mission was conducted in a ground-based incubator with six MVP modules resulting in 883 flies. For the postflight control (Earth), flies were placed in each module to match the flight condition and were reared under identical conditions to match the temperature, relative humidity, O2, and CO2 levels recorded for the entire experiment on the ISS. The CO2 levels within habitats in space are often significantly higher than those on the ground due to the technical difficulty of scrubbing the CO2 from an entirely enclosed environment (ISS). The average CO2 level in the MVP hardware during this experiment ranged between 3500-5443 ppm during the mission and was replicated temporally and identically in the ground control. By comparison, the CO2 level under regular laboratory conditions averages <1000 ppm (Hussin et al., 2017). Also, another variable in any spaceflight study is sound pressure level. Based on ISS’s telemetry data and payload permissible limits, SF1g and SFμg flies in the MVP module on ISS experienced average sound pressure levels of 65dB. Similar sound pressure levels (62-65dB) were noted in the vicinity of the Earth controls placed in the laboratory incubator (Percival Scientific). The Earth control flies were fixed in RNAlater and subjected to postflight analyses following the same timeline as the flies from ISS. The Earth control used for comparison and statistical analysis in this manuscript is this postflight ground control.B. Fly husbandry, loading the module, and development The w1118 wildtype line (Bloomington Stock Center) was used in this study. Thirty hours prior to launch, one-day-old virgin male (10) and female (25) fruit flies were loaded into the adult food cylinder 3 in each of the six MVP modules (F0 generation). The food cylinder was then immediately opened to adult fly chamber 2 (Figure S1B, C). The modules were then placed inside of a standard cargo transfer bag for launch. Prepared food cylinders were stored at 4°C for the duration of launch and ISS operations. Approximately 3.7 days (90 hrs) after launch, the payload was delivered to the ISS and the crew installed a food cylinder 2 inside the MVP module and opened the food cylinder 2 to adult fly chamber 2 (Mission day=5), giving flies access to the new food. Food cylinder 3 was closed at this time. This procedure was repeated for all MVP modules, and the modules were loaded into the previously installed MVP habitat hardware (Figure S1A) by the ISS crew. At this time, the six SF1g modules started spinning at 68 rpm to maintain 1g in spaceflight while the six SFμg modules were maintained at microgravity levels. After 5.5 days of egg laying (Mission Day=10), food cylinder 2 was opened to adult fly chamber 1 to allow the eggs laid in space to develop and emerge into adult flies in chamber 1. At the same time food cylinder 2 was closed to adult fly chamber 2, such that the launch populations of flies were prevented from entering food cylinder 2, thus keeping the generations separated (Figure S1C). Food cylinder 3 was reopened to adult fly chamber 2 to continue providing food to this population for the remainder of the experiment. The larvae and flies that emerged from the food cylinder 2 into the adult fly chamber 1 had undergone their entire developmental life cycle during spaceflight (F1 generation). At this time, food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1 to allow egg laying in cylinder 1, which will produce the second generation of spaceflight-developed flies (F2 generation). Food cylinder 2 remained open to chamber 1 during egg lay to allow adults to continue emerging. This also allowed us to know the age range of the adult flies returned for postflight experiments (~11-17-day adults). After 8 days of egg laying, food cylinder 1 from each module containing F2 generation fruit fly eggs and larvae, and some F1 generation adults, was fixed in RNAlater (Invitrogen). This allowed us to have samples that were fixed in RNAlater in space for “omics” analyses on the ground to track the progression of acclimation to spaceflight as animals develop in space under different gravity conditions. Following the fixation, a fresh food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1, and food cylinder 2 was closed. The MVP locker was powered down after the experiment, and fixed F1 generation flies and F2 generation eggs and larvae were placed in the MELFI-2 freezer at −80°C until the samples returned. Thus, this experimental design allowed us to freeze adult flies (F1 generation), larvae (F2 generation), and eggs (F2 generation) at Day 29. Postflight, we retrieved live adult flies (F1 generation), and eggs and larvae of F2 generation in the new food cylinder 1. All the science operations, including food cylinder changes and fixation and opening/closing of chambers, were performed by the ISS crew. Unforeseen weather conditions delayed the mission by 4 days, during which the crew repowered the MVP hardware on mission day 31 and powered it off on mission day 34 for return to Earth.METHOD DETAILS A. Inflight behavioral analysis To quantify fly activity on the ISS, a simple but robust algorithm was developed using image-processing techniques in Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999) running on a MacBook Pro with an i7 core processor. Only the videos from adult fly chamber 1 SF1g and SFμg were analyzed in this study (Mission days 13 to 28 – Figure S1C) since these chambers contained the flies bred entirely in space (F1 generation). The age of the flies assessed from video imaging of the inflight behavior ranged from 1 to 16-days (Postflight assays were conducted with flies with a smaller age range as described in the relevant sections). Similar video recording arrangements were made for Earth condition, but the videos could not be recorded due to technical issues. Full resolution 8-bit images (1986x1064) were used for analysis. The individual frames from the video images have a predominant intensity in the blue channel (Figure 1C.i). Therefore, each video image was separated into its three RGB components, and the blue channel (shown in grayscale) was inverted and used for further analysis (Figure 1C.ii) as it provided best visualization of the flies. Once inverted, resulting images had individual flies that appeared as white pixels on a gray background. For each movie, maximum intensity projections (MIP) were computed by overlaying individual video frames and keeping the brightest pixels across all time points, resulting in a stroboscopic motion-like effect (Figure 1C.iii and 1C.iv). The pixel location of the MIP was mapped on a composite image to visualize the locomotion of individual flies during each video. These tracks had a higher intensity and appeared brighter than the background. Flies that did not move did not create a track, as seen between Figure 1C.ii and 1C.iii indicated in green. However, flies that were active during the video recording created a white track, shown in Figures 1C.ii and 1C.iii in blue and red. This process resulted in a single image that displayed the tracks of the fly population throughout a series of 28-second video recordings (Figure 1C.iv). Using the MIP images of adult fly chamber 1, we could determine when flies were active. The videos from mission day 13 to 28 (Figure S1C) that tracked the F1 generation of flies as shown in Figures 1D, E. In other words, this time frame included initial fly emergence when the majority of the space-bred generation of flies entered adult fly chamber 1 from food cylinder 2 but ended prior to fly numbers and debris levels increasing to a point where the camera view was obstructed (Figure S2). The number of flies in a chamber increased over time due to reproduction based on the life cycle of D. melanogaster (Fernández-Moreno et al., 2007) (Figure S2). Six videos per day, each 28 seconds in duration that spanned the 12-hr light period, were processed to produce MIP images for each fly module. One of the six modules containing the population bred in μg malfunctioned during flight, so our analysis includes six modules in SF1g and five modules in SFμg. Videos from adult fly chamber 2 were not used for analysis because 1) the build-up of debris due to more extended periods of growth compared to adult fly chamber 1 obscured the camera view, and 2) the chamber contained mixed generations of flies. The pixel intensities were summed for each MIP image, resulting in a single numerical value for every video. The more a fly moves, the longer are the white streaks that can be observed along its path on the MIP and the higher is the total measured intensity. The process was repeated for each video producing a series of numerical values to quantify the overall activity of the fly population during the mission. Supplementary video 1, 2 is a representative video showing the fly chambers of SF1g and SFμg, where suspended flies are seen in microgravity condition. The color map in Figure 1D was generated by setting the minimum value in the color map to the baseline intensity obtained from the first frame of the video. The intensities across all modules and treatments were scaled such that the video with the MIP image having the highest summated intensity (and therefore highest activity) was set to the maximum color on the color scale (Figure 1D). Note: No videos were analyzed for activity past day 28 due to the increased fly numbers and debris interfering with the image quality.B. Climbing assay Climbing assay was performed on F1 generation of flies returned to Earth using a modified version of Le Bourg and Lints (Feany and Bender, 2000). For each condition, flies were sorted and collected by sex, in groups of ten per food vial (F=100, M=100) as soon as the live flight samples were returned on earth (i.e., Fig. 1B, splash at L+34, 2 days for samples turnover (Long Beach, CA) and arrived at NASA ARC (R+0) and the assay was conducted. During the climbing assay, flies were transferred to a clean, empty vial and allowed to adjust for 1 minute. The flies were tapped down to the bottom, and the number of flies climbing past the 5 cm mark measured from the bottom of the vial in 18 seconds was recorded as a percentage of flies able to climb per vial (climbing ability). This assay was repeated three times for each vial, with a 30 second rest between trials. An average of three trials was reported per vial. Measurements from all three trials were averaged. The significance was determined between the conditions by a one-way ANOVA analysis with the condition as the independent variable.C. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging of brains F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. The R+0 and R+25 brains were stained for immunohistochemical analysis (described below) where staining for different antibody markers was conducted at the same time to facilitate comparison and reduce variability. The brains were stained following a standard protocol (Iyer et al., 2018; Mhatre et al., 2014). Briefly, the fixed brains were washed with PBS and PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each, incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum (Catalog # 566380, Sigma) in PBT) for one hour, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. One set of brains were stained with anti-elav (1:100, Catalog # 7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), host species - rat) to label all the neurons, anti-cc3 (1:100, Catalog # 9661, Cell signaling Technology, host species - rabbit) as apoptotic marker, and anti-8-oxo-dG (1:100, Catalog # 4354-MC-050, R&D systems, host species - mouse) as the DNA oxidative damage marker. Another set of brains were stained with anti-Repo (1:50, Catalog # 8D12, DSHB), University of Iowa, host species - mouse) to label the glia, and anti-TH (1:300, Catalog # AB152, EMD Millipore, host species - rabbit) to label the dopaminergic neurons. These preparations were then washed three times with PBT for 10 min each, and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Catalog # A-11031, Invitrogen), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Catalog # A-11034, Invitrogen), or Alexa fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200; Catalog # A21094, Invitrogen). Final washes were performed once with PBT and twice with PBS, each for 10 min, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000) for imaging. Stained brains were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope in the histology and microscopy core facility at the Gladstone Institute, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The ELAV neuronal cortex, neuropil, and the total brain area were traced and quantified using Image J software (v1.52g, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). This method is a gross measurement adapted from previously published papers (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Mhatre et al., 2014). The data reported here are the neuronal cortex and neuropil area normalized to the total brain area. Similarly, the number of puncta for TH (total number of TH-positive cells), repo, 8-oxo-dG, and CC3 were analyzed and quantified for each stain/marker using the cell counter in ImageJ software and are reported as absolute values.D. RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis of fly heads The food cylinders that were frozen on ISS were slow-thawed at 4°C before opening. Once thawed, cylinders were opened, and flies (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) were removed and sorted by sex. The head was removed using spring scissors and placed in RNAlater to preserve the RNA and protein integrity. Total RNA was extracted using RNA/Protein Purification plus (Norgen) from adult heads with four biological replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate). This kit isolated total RNA and protein from the same samples. Isolated RNA was used to perform paired-end RNA sequencing on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, with an average of 20M reads of PE150 per sample (Novogene, Sacramento, CA). Data validation and quality control with FASTQC were conducted by Novogene, Inc. The standardized Genelab pipeline was used for the analysis (Overbey et al., 2021). Briefly, raw RNA sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! v0.6.2 (Krueger, 2019), aligned to the Drosophila reference genome (Dmel release 6.08) and transcriptome with STAR Version 2.7.1a (Dobin et al., 2013), and read counts for each transcript were generated using RSEM v1.3.1. Differentially expressed gene lists were generated using a custom Genelab R script, GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, utilizing the DESeq2 v1.22.2 R package (Lai Polo et al., 2020). False discovery rate (adjusted p-value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment, and the differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.E. Proteomics and analysis of fly heads Proteins isolated from adult heads (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) using the Norgen Biotek kit were used to determine the global proteomic changes. Three replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate) were used for protein isolation and enzymatic digestion. Isolated protein samples were digested and desalted according to Lundby et al. (Lundby et al., 2012). Protein concentrations were then determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Proteins were then reduced, alkylated and subjected to acetone precipitation prior to digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Wako, Richmond, VA). This was followed by digestion with trypsin, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Promega, Madison, WI), and desalting and concentrating using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). TMT Isobaric Labeling - Peptides were mass tagged using Thermo-Fisher’s TMT 10-plex isobaric label kit (Catalog # 90061) following the included protocol and pooled for analysis. Six experimental conditions were labeled in triplicate across three TMT-runs, including two internal control channels.Basic Reversed-Phase Fractionation – Pooled TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by basic pH reversed-phase (BPRP) fractionation on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) using an integrated fraction collector. Elution was performed using a 10-minute gradient of 0-20% solvent B followed by a 50-minute gradient of solvent B from 20-45% (Solvent A 5.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, Solvent B 90.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0) on a Zorbax 300Extend-C18 column (Agilent) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A total of 24 fractions were collected at 37-second intervals in a looping fashion for 60 minutes then combined to produce 12 super fractions. Peptide elution was monitored at a wavelength of 220nm using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 variable wavelength detector (Thermo Scientific). Each fraction was then centrifuged to near dryness and desalted using C18 Sep-Pak Cartridges followed again by centrifugation to near dryness and reconstitution with 20 ul of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry- BPRP fractions were then separated using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) on a self-packed C18 column (100 um x 35 cm). Separation was performed using a 180-minute gradient of solvent B from 2-27% (Solvent A 0.1% Formic Acid, Solvent B Acetonitrile, 0.1% Formic Acid) at 50°C using a digital PicoView nanospray source (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) that was modified with a custom-built column heater and an ABIRD background suppressor (ESI Source Solutions, Woburn, MA). An in-house column was prepared by packing a 100μm inner diameter picofrit column (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) with 1.9μm ReproSil-Pure C18 (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) and packed to a length of 30 cm at 9000 psi using a nano-LC column packing kit (nanoLCMS, Gold River, CA). Mass spectral analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). TMT analysis was performed using an MS3 multi-notch approach. The MS1 precursor selection range is from 400-1400 m/z at a resolution of 120K and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2.0 x 105 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Quadrupole isolation at 0.7 Th for MS2 analysis using CID fragmentation in the linear ion trap with a collision energy of 35%. The AGC was set to 4.0 x 103 with a maximum injection time of 150ms. The instrument was operated in a top-speed data-dependent mode with a most intense precursor priority with dynamic exclusion set to an exclusion duration of 60 seconds with a 10ppm tolerance. MS2 fragment ions were captured in the MS3 precursor population. These MS3 precursors were then isolated within a 2.5 Da window and subjected to high energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 55%. The ions were then detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC of 5.0 x 104 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. The data was then analyzed using SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version v.27, rev. 11.) and Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA. version 2.1).Database Searching Tandem mass spectra were extracted, and charge states were deconvoluted by Proteome Discoverer version 2.1. Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) by searching the data against a protein database, including all entries from the Uniprot Drosophila proteome (UniProt UP00000803, containing 21,041 sequences, download date 10-29-2019) combined with the common contaminants sequences from the Global Proteome Machine. Sequest searches were performed using a parent ion tolerance of 1.25 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00005 Da, and requiring each peptides’ termini to have trypsin protease specificity while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) was set as static modification, while TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.162932 Da), acetylation of the protein Nterminus, and methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as variable modification. Reporter Ions Quantifier settings were set to include unique and razor peptides, Quan value correction factors from manufacturer applied, co-isolation threshold 50%, average reporter S/N 10, and no normalization or scaling of the channels.Proteomic Data Analysis The unscaled, non-normalized protein-level total reporter ion intensities derived from unique peptides were exported from Proteome Discoverer. Data quality assessment and control, normalization and analyses were performed using R v 4.0.1. Proteins underwent three filtering steps: 1) proteins containing missing values in any condition, 2) proteins with fewer than two unique peptide matches, and 3) proteins identified in only one or two out of the three runs were excluded from the quantitative analysis. Each TMT run was internally scaled, then transformed and analyzed together. Merged data were greatly affected by commonly seen batch effects associated to individual runs. Bioconductor package Limma v 3.44.3 was used to identify sexspecific abundance differences per protein in response to changing gravity conditions relative to ground/earth control by performing an empirical Bayes moderated t-test accounting for the seen batch effect caused by each individual TMT run (Ritchie et al., 2015). Calculated p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistically significant difference was defined by an FDR cutoff of 0.05.F. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis The differentially expressed genes and proteins with FDR adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were used for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.0 (Yu et al., 2012) and Drosophila database (org.Dm.eg.db version 3.13). Specifically, we used enrichGO and enrichKEGG functions to determine functionally enriched GO categories for are three annotations: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) and KEGG pathways (Carbon et al., 2021) for all contrasts across both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. Results were visualized by R packages ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and pheatmap (Kolde, 2015). The intersecting genes and proteins within and across the multi-omics platform were plotted using the Upset plot (Khan and Mathelier, 2017). Pathway visualization was performed using the KEGG mapper function provided by Kanehisa Laboratories (https://www.kegg.jp/). Venn diagrams were generated using Venny 2.1 (Oliveros, 2015).QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantification methods for the various assays and parameters are described in the relevant Methods section. Statistical analyses and plot generation were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v. 9.1.0). For Figure 1E, two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed to determine statistical significance. Grubbs test was performed on all climbing and immunohistochemistry datasets to remove outliers. In Figures 2, 6 (A–C, F), S3A, and S7, Grubbs test was followed by testing for normal Gaussian distribution via the D’AgostinoPearson test except in data with a low sample size (TH and Repo), where the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was performed. If data were normally distributed, a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, was performed to determine statistical significance. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. For Figure 6D, a non-parametric t-test (Mann-Whitney test) was performed to compare all conditions (Earth, SF1g, and SFμg) within their respective time points (R+0, R+25). A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The error bars in the figures represent SEM (Standard Error Mean). All data are means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 5-12 per group). The number of flies used per experiment is indicated in the figure legend. Inflight behavior analysis was conducted by composing Matlab code using Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999).Supplementary Material Figure S1Figure S1 (related to Figure 1A, B): MVP-FLY-01 hardware and mission timeline. (A) Representative image of the MVP Drosophila hardware. (B) MVP Drosophila unit -12 total units were installed in the MVP, six on each carousel. Each food cylinder was labeled in accordance with the actions detailed in Figure 2. The experiment was launched with flies in chamber 2/cylinder 3 and food in cylinder 3. Food cylinders 2 and 1 were not included in launch orientation. Each food cylinder had two openings, and the outer plastic vessel that contains the aluminum food cylinder had a single opening that rotated back and forth to give flies access to one side of the cylinder at a time. This allowed us to control entry of flies into the food cylinder from only a single adult fly chamber at a time, therefore controlling access to egg laying and allowed for separation of generations. Green arrows indicate the progression of the experiment throughout the mission. (C) Schematic of operations timeline onboard ISS during the experiment. The first yellow section represents the time between the packing of the hardware with flies and the time that the experiment began operation on ISS. The following red sections represent times that the modules were packed in cargo transfer bags, and the experiment was inactive. Colored blocks represent different phases of the experiment, which were separated by cylinder rotations and experiment operations. (Day 5) The MVP unit was powered on, and fruit fly food cylinder 2 was retrieved from 4°C storage and inserted into the module. The launch configuration allowed each module to have a food cylinder in the “food cylinder 3” slot, to support the first generation of flies during launch. After this time (the beige section), the initial generation of flies laid eggs in food cylinder 2. Food cylinder 3 was also temporarily closed, to encourage flies to lay eggs on the new food. (Day 10) Food cylinder 2 was rotated so that it faced chamber 1 (the blue section), and the new generation of eggs that were laid entirely in space would emerge into adults in fly chamber 1. This separates the initial adults from the food that contains the eggs for the next generation. Food cylinder 3 was also reopened to fly chamber 2. This allowed for the emergence of new flies, which were laid starting from Launch 1 day into Fly Chamber 2. (Day 21) Food cylinder 1 was retrieved from 4°C and installed. This allowed the flies emerging from cylinder 2 into fly chamber 1 to have fresh food and start laying the eggs that were ultimately fixed in RNAlater for other experiments on day 29. (Day 29) Cylinder 2 was closed off and rotated back to chamber 2, further preventing flies from emerging into chamber 1. A new food cylinder 1 was replaced to provide flies in chamber 1 with fresh food for the return journey. Chamber 1, at this point, only contained the complete generation of live flies bred entirely in space and returned for ground experiments. These flies were 11-17 days of age upon return. Videos from mission days 13-28 were analyzed for inflight behavioral assessments. (Day 31) A weather delay caused undocking to be pushed by at least 48 hrs. At this time, the flies were re-inserted into the MVP unit (yellow section) to avoid exposure of space 1g on-orbit control to the ISS micro-g for too long before sample return. (Day 33) MVP power was finally shut off for the journey back to Earth.

Supplementary Materials Figure S1Figure S1 (related to Figure 1A, B): MVP-FLY-01 hardware and mission timeline. (A) Representative image of the MVP Drosophila hardware. (B) MVP Drosophila unit -12 total units were installed in the MVP, six on each carousel. Each food cylinder was labeled in accordance with the actions detailed in Figure 2. The experiment was launched with flies in chamber 2/cylinder 3 and food in cylinder 3. Food cylinders 2 and 1 were not included in launch orientation. Each food cylinder had two openings, and the outer plastic vessel that contains the aluminum food cylinder had a single opening that rotated back and forth to give flies access to one side of the cylinder at a time. This allowed us to control entry of flies into the food cylinder from only a single adult fly chamber at a time, therefore controlling access to egg laying and allowed for separation of generations. Green arrows indicate the progression of the experiment throughout the mission. (C) Schematic of operations timeline onboard ISS during the experiment. The first yellow section represents the time between the packing of the hardware with flies and the time that the experiment began operation on ISS. The following red sections represent times that the modules were packed in cargo transfer bags, and the experiment was inactive. Colored blocks represent different phases of the experiment, which were separated by cylinder rotations and experiment operations. (Day 5) The MVP unit was powered on, and fruit fly food cylinder 2 was retrieved from 4°C storage and inserted into the module. The launch configuration allowed each module to have a food cylinder in the “food cylinder 3” slot, to support the first generation of flies during launch. After this time (the beige section), the initial generation of flies laid eggs in food cylinder 2. Food cylinder 3 was also temporarily closed, to encourage flies to lay eggs on the new food. (Day 10) Food cylinder 2 was rotated so that it faced chamber 1 (the blue section), and the new generation of eggs that were laid entirely in space would emerge into adults in fly chamber 1. This separates the initial adults from the food that contains the eggs for the next generation. Food cylinder 3 was also reopened to fly chamber 2. This allowed for the emergence of new flies, which were laid starting from Launch 1 day into Fly Chamber 2. (Day 21) Food cylinder 1 was retrieved from 4°C and installed. This allowed the flies emerging from cylinder 2 into fly chamber 1 to have fresh food and start laying the eggs that were ultimately fixed in RNAlater for other experiments on day 29. (Day 29) Cylinder 2 was closed off and rotated back to chamber 2, further preventing flies from emerging into chamber 1. A new food cylinder 1 was replaced to provide flies in chamber 1 with fresh food for the return journey. Chamber 1, at this point, only contained the complete generation of live flies bred entirely in space and returned for ground experiments. These flies were 11-17 days of age upon return. Videos from mission days 13-28 were analyzed for inflight behavioral assessments. (Day 31) A weather delay caused undocking to be pushed by at least 48 hrs. At this time, the flies were re-inserted into the MVP unit (yellow section) to avoid exposure of space 1g on-orbit control to the ISS micro-g for too long before sample return. (Day 33) MVP power was finally shut off for the journey back to Earth.

    "title": "Utilizing the KSC fixation tube to conduct human-tended plant biology experiments on a suborbital spaceflight",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9693084/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach. Keywords: suborbital space, KSC fixation tubes, RNA-seq, arabidopsis, transcriptomics",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The commercial suborbital spaceflight industry enables customers to reach the cusp of space and experience microgravity for several minutes before returning to Earth. The two main companies at the forefront of suborbital space efforts are Blue Origin (BO) and Virgin Galactic (VG). The two companies use different vehicles for their suborbital launches. Blue Origin flies New Shepard, a vertical rocket with a Crew Capsule. Virgin Galactic flies SpaceShipTwo, a rocket plane that is carried to high altitude before being dropped for launch. As such, the two providers present different modes of operations, different customer experiences and different flight profiles. Common features of both suborbital providers are a high g launch, minutes of microgravity conditions, followed by a high g re-entry. Although, the providers have different flight and gravity profiles, they both enable approximately three minutes of unmitigated microgravity [1,2]. It is those minutes of microgravity that are of high interest to science. From a biological researcher’s perspective, three minutes of high-quality microgravity opens the possibility to conduct a myriad of experiments—including but not limited to testing hardware capability, validating hypothesis, and understanding biological responses of not only microgravity, but the entirety of the spaceflight profile. Even though providers currently offer researchers an opportunity to send payloads on suborbital flight, there are severe limitations in that the untended experiment payloads are required to be contained in a locker, under fully autonomously controlled without the ability of the scientist to monitor and adjust for unforeseen situations. Thus, human suborbital spaceflight provides a promising complementary opportunity for researchers to conduct human-tended microgravity-related experiments using human capabilities that can better recapitulate a laboratory bench experiment than can an automated locker payload. Sampling biological responses at various phases of flight for subsequent analysis would be a natural initial experiment to understand biology responses to suborbital space. Plants being sessile in nature have evolved mechanisms to rapidly respond to their environment. Early transcriptomic responses have been investigated in response to various stresses such as; oxidative stress, heat stress, pathogen attack, and water stress [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Suborbital flights allow for the investigation of how plants quickly respond to transitions in varying gravity forces. To conduct such an experiment, there are several parameters that need to be considered. The rapid transitions into and out of microgravity occur within minutes, thus there is limited time for sample preparations and fixation. Plants should be poised and ready in a medium that confers as little confounding stresses as possible and upon exposure to the changes in gravity, and then be easily and rapidly preserved for proper biochemical analysis. Samples and fixatives should be triple contained and compact in size so that the hardware can be easily stowed during the flight. In addition, the acts of human tended fixation of the samples should be able to be completed rapidly. This paper describes a ground-based experiment setup that was developed to meet the needs for conducting a human tended plant biology experiments in a suborbital flight. This method highlights the expanded use of KSC Fixation Tubes as both houses for biology and for the subsequent fixation of that biology. The paper also discusses best practices for both experiment setup and conducting a RNAseq analysis to reliably report on the transcriptome of plant samples at various stages of a suborbital flight profile.",
    "methods": "2. Materials & Methods 2.1. Plant Growth Conditions Wet-sterilized Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates comprised of the coupon inlaid with 1% Phytagel/0.5× MS media. Plants were grown under a broad-spectrum LED light bank (100 µmoles/m2) for approximately 24-h the first three days. On day 3, plates were moved to dark storage (to simulate travel to launch locations) where they spent 8 h, before being transferred to a growth unit (Danby #DFG17A1B, Montreal, QC, Canada) which is used at remote locations for plant growth. The Danby provided 24 h of approximately 80 µmoles/m2 of light for another 4 days. 2.2. Plant Dissection and RNA Extraction From each condition, two individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and a total of three biological replicates were obtained from two coupons in each KFT. Leaves, hypocotyls, and roots from each set were dissected under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for downstream applications, whereas the intervening hypocotyls were set aside. RNA extraction was performed using Qiagen RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany catalog #74904) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.3. RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation First, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, catalog #E7490). Then, followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) with 2/3 of poly A enriched RNA and 1/10 reaction volume using SPT Labtech mosquito LV liquid handling instrument. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 15 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). Barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration for sequencing aiming for 60 million reads per sample with total of 1 lane of NovaSeq S4 2 × 150 cycles run. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, accessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019145). The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 × 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, assessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019152). 2.4. Illumina NovaSeq6000 Sequencing Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950 Gb) with an average Q30% ≥ 92.5% and Cluster PF = 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. 2.5. Bioinformatics Pipeline and Gene Ontology Analysis Reads acquired from the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform were cleaned up with the cutadapt program [10] to trim off sequencing adaptors and low-quality bases with a quality phred-like score < 20. Reads <40 bases were excluded from RNA-seq analysis. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (version TAIR10.51) from TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) was used as the reference sequences for RNA-seq analysis. The cleaned reads of each sample were mapped to the reference sequences using the read mapper of the STAR package (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference, v2.7.9a) [11]. The mapping results were processed with the HTSeq (High-Throughput Sequence Analysis in Python, v0.11.2) [12] samtools, and scripts developed in house at ICBR of UF to remove potential PCR duplicates, choose and count uniquely mapped reads for gene expression analysis. The counted reads of each gene were analyzed by a DESeq2-based R pipeline. Significant up- and down-regulated genes were selected using the threshold of −1.0 < Log2FoldChange < 1.0 and p-value ≤ 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using g:GOSt (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost, accessed on 11 November 2022.) with default settings to obtain terms of GO biological process.",

Optimizing Plant Growth Conditions within the KFT The original purpose of the KFT was to allow astronauts in space to apply fixative or other chemical compounds that are often toxic to biological samples without the use of a microgravity glovebox while maintaining three levels of containment [13]. For example, KFTs have been used in the past to fix plant samples from a number of spaceflight plant biological experiments [14,15,16,17,18]. The dimensions of the sample compartment of the KFT (Figure 1a) were 22.1 mm (diameter) × 62.8 mm (depth). Figure 1.

Wire mesh coupons were encased in the solidified phytagel media (i) front (ii) back. (iii) schematic of the coupon layout. (iv) Image of the plants growing on coupons inlaid in phytagel matrix.

(ii) Image of pre-actuated KFT. (iii) Image of actuated KFT with samples fixed in RNAlater.The general application has been that the astronaut would remove a biological sample from its growth container and transfer the biology to the KFT sample tube. Once the sample was in the KFT, the KFT was sealed, and the fixative was brought into contact with the sample by activating the KFT mechanism [15]. However, for use in the short timeframes of suborbital flights, the KFTs need to be sealed before flight. This requirement necessitates that the biology be installed into the KFTs as part of a preflight procedure, and the KFT therefore becomes a biology incubator before it is activated to fix the sample. This allows the KFT to serve its purpose of containment safety for the entirety of the suborbital flight. Many previous plant molecular biology spaceflight-related experiments utilized Petri dishes containing a matrix nutrient gel to grow plants on the ISS in a variety of plant growth hardware systems (i.e., BRIC, Biological Research in Canister; ABRS, Advanced Biological Research System; EMCS, European Modular Cultivation System; Veggie). Typically, these plates are taped closed with a porous surgical Micropore® 3M™ tape, that allows for gas exchange, allowing plants to grow in this configuration for up to fourteen days. To ensure that plants are kept healthy, intact, and experience minimal stress responses when deployed into the KFTs, plants were grown for 7 days on wire mesh coupons suspended into growth media within the 100 mm square Petri plate. The details to construct the deployable coupon are as follows. First, 0.425 mm stainless steel wire mesh (Yikai, UPC: 615435104645) was cut into 22 mm by 62 mm sections, with one short end rounded and bent for holding. The mesh coupons were then autoclaved. The square Petri plates were poured with 10 mL of media, allowed to slightly cool, and then the wire mesh coupons were laid on the solidified media. Finally, 15 mL of media was added to the dish to cover the tops of the coupons. Sterilized seeds were planted approximately 5 mm below the bend in the coupons and were grown vertically to allow roots to grow down the coupons (Figure 1a). When ready for placement into KFTs, the media and coupons with plants on the surface were cut out and carefully placed into the KFT (Supplementary Video Data S1). As the internal diameter of the KFT’s sample chamber is the same size as the width of the coupons, the edge of the entire length and base of the coupon is supported by the KFT resulting in an exact fit. Each KFT can hold two coupons, back-to-back, with a total of six 7-day old Arabidopsis plants on each. The bottom chamber of the KFT is filled with ~25 mL of RNAlater and upon actuation of the plunger, RNAlater flows into the sample chamber and the fixation of the plants is immediately initiated [14,15]. A simulation of a simple suborbital flight profile was used in this ground-based study to investigate the responses of plants grown in the KFTs over a time period roughly similar to the flight profiles for both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. To initiate pre-flight sample preparation, plants on coupons were inserted into the experiment KFTs, the KFTs were sealed by inserting the actuators, and all KFTs were placed in the vertical orientation (Supplementary Video Data S2). This simulates the preparation of biology into the KFTs to be ready for transport and installation into the spacecraft. KFTs were that left in the vertical orientation and not disturbed through the time course were referred to as Quiescent (Q), (Figure 2). After the KFT’s were set up and sealed, they were left to rest for 3 h and 50 min, to model a reasonably long time prior to launch. During actual launch operations, this would the time that the samples would be required to undergo check-out and hand off to vehicle loading procedures for flight operations. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Setup of KFTs for simulated suborbital spaceflight profile. (a) Image of KFTs loaded with coupons and actuated after the respective timepoints. (b) Four time points of quiescent (Q1–Q4) and one set of treatment on clinostat (C) from Q2 to Q3, seedlings were harvested. Another set of four KFTs were used for comparison with a Petri dish control at Q1. The tissues were fixed in RNAlater overnight and then dissected to roots and leaves, which were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. (c) Image of KFT mounted on a 2-D Clinostat.Samples at Q1 (T-10 min, 3 h 50 min after sealing in the KFTs) were actuated and fixed 10 min before the mock launch timepoint (T+0). Additionally, at the T-10 min timepoint, an additional set of four KFTs (Q1A, Q1B, Q1C and Q1D) were actuated to assess the variability and reproducibility of the plant transcriptome simply from being housed for that amount of time in the KFTs. To understand how this methodology differs from the standard Petri dish configuration typically used in spaceflight experiments, the plant transcriptome obtained from each of the four Q1 KFTs (Q1A-D) were compared to the transcriptome from a Petri dish control at the same T-10 min timepoint. Through the remainder of the time course, one KFT was used for each timepoint. Samples Q2, Q3, and Q4 were actuated 4 min, 8 min, and 18 min after T+0 mock launch, which mimicked the flight profile times of boost end / coast start (Q2: T+4 min), coast end (Q3: T+8 min), and landing (Q4: T+18 min), respectively. In addition, a set of samples were placed on a clinostat starting at the Q2 timepoint and fixed at the Q3 timepoint. Here, the KFT was mounted onto a 2-dimensional clinostat parallel to the plane of rotation (Figure 2c) and was rotated at 1 rpm for 4 min. Based on the radius (150 mm) of the clinostat, a rotation at 1 rpm would result in a simulated altered microgravity profile of 1.67 × 104 g. KFTs were actuated, filling the sample compartment with RNAlater. Plants were allowed to imbibe in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 h. After fixation, seedlings were harvested at each timepoint and each KFT, with the plants on the two coupons within each KFT divided into three biological replicates. For each sample, roots and leaves were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. 3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth Root tissues from four replicate KFTs (Q1A-D) and one Petri dish (Q1P) were analyzed to investigate how plants responded to living within the KFTs for three hours and fifty minutes, in order to assay the effects of preflight sealing into the KFTs. The four KFTs showed a total of 163, 201, 139, and 178 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), when compared to Q1P, the samples taken directly from the Petri plates (Figure 3a). The composition of DEGs in the Q1A-D KFT replicates compared to Q1P showed a substantial number of similarities, with 45.7% of DEGs shared by at least two comparisons of KFT versus Q1P Petri plate (Figure 3b). In addition, a pairwise comparison between replicates showed an average of only 23 DEGs (Table 1), suggesting that growth conditions with each of the KFTs had little variation. This observation of reproducibility across four individual KFT replicates was also highlighted in the trends observed in the gene expression heatmap (Figure 3c, Table S1). Across all four KFT replicates, DEGs that were significantly altered in at least one comparison had the same regulatory trend across all the KFTs. This is indicated by the consistent Log fold change coloration in any given gene row of the heatmap. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the list of 244 DEGs upregulated in root tissue grown in KFTs compared to the plate showed an enrichment for ethylene response. Figure 3.

Therefore, an upregulation of ethylene is probable when compared to plants grown on the Q1P Petri plate. In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [19]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data. 3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile The intent of the time-course experiment that modeled a suborbital flight profile was to investigate plant transcriptomic profiles in the KFTs over the time it takes to complete a suborbital flight, and to access how to best establish ground controls. KFT’s were loaded and sealed at T-4 h prior to the T+0 timepoint. Root tissues (R) harvested from the KFTs actuated at coast start (Q2R), coast end (Q3R), and landing (Q4R) were compared to the control Q1R (T-10 min) In roots, there was an increase in the number of DEGs over time with 123, 183, and 240 DEGs reported for Q2R vs. Q1R, Q3R vs. Q1R, and Q4R vs. Q1R, respectively (Figure 4a). Interestingly, more than 50% of all the reported DEGs were unique to each time point (Figure 4b). This observation suggests that over time, different genes in the root tissues were engaged or repressed to acclimate growing in the KFT environment. However, trends in the gene expression pattern (Figure 4c, Table S2), demonstrate genes in all three time points behaved similarly. GO analysis of the upregulated genes showed that genes associated with hypoxia were enriched across all three time points. Analysis of the 256 DEGs including the 199 downregulated genes across all time points showed no significant GO enrichment associated with biological processes (Figure 4c). By comparing plant responses in KFTs for different durations to the KFT vs. plate study, it validates that the absence of gas exchange is the dominant response root tissues adapt to. Figure 4. Open in a new tab DEGs detected in at least one comparison of Q2, Q3 or Q4 vs. Q1 in roots. (a) Number of DEGs in three comparisons. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing expression patterns of 465 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. GO terms of biological processes for 209 induced genes are shown. Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. The red box highlights GO enrichments that are associated with hypoxia responses.In leaf tissues (L), 114 DEGs were identified in the Q2L vs. Q1L comparison, followed by 36 DEGs in Q3L vs. Q1L, and 38 DEGs in Q4L vs. Q1L (Figure 5a). These results suggest that the leaf tissues do not have as much of a response to being in the KFTs when compared to the root tissues. The deceasing number of DEGs over time (Figure 5a), suggests that leaves might be adapting quickly to the KFT environment. From the number of DEGs seen in each comparison, a large proportion (>90%) were unique to each time-point, with very little overlap (Figure 5b). However, looking at the trends of the gene expression heatmap of all DEGs across all time points, several distinct clusters are observed (Figure 5c, Table S3). In the first cluster, genes were generally upregulated across all the time points and GO enrichment analysis indicated that these set of 49 genes were associated with responses to fructose. The second cluster of 60 genes showed varying regulation of gene expression across the time points with GO enrichments indicating responses to light and photosynthesis. The third cluster showed 70 genes that were generally downregulated across all the time points. GO enrichment showed genes that were downregulated in the third cluster were associated with responses to stimuli. Among these, light associated responses were striking and could be explained by the altered light conditions when plants were inserted into KFTs. The thickness and slight opaqueness of the material used to construct the KFT might cause a reduction of light reaching the plants. Overall, the hypoxic responses in roots and light-related signaling in leaves were the most observable influence on plants when grown in the KFT for a short period of time. Figure 5.

Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. 3.4. Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. Clinostat roots (CR) compared to the various root controls (Q3R, Q1R, combined Q1R + Q3R, and pooled Q1R + Q2R + Q3R) revealed that although gene expression trends were similar across all comparisons, using the appropriate controls can better segregate between gravity-related responses from other confounding responses (Figure 6). In root tissues, a total of 369 genes showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison (Figure 6a). In this experimental design, Q1 was designated as a sample point before “launch”. The root tissues in CR were in the KFT 18 min longer than Q1R and showed a substantial number of unique DEGs not observed in the other controls, which had GO enrichment mainly involved in temperature stimulus and abiotic stress responses (Figure 6a). The overlaps of the significant DEGs between each comparison showed 11 (3%) genes shared by all comparisons, 79 (21.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and 267 (72.4%) genes were unique to Q1R (Figure 6b). The gene expression trends showed that the majority of the 369 genes shared similar expression profiles regardless of the control used (Figure 6c, Table S4). Comparing the gene expression trends between CR versus Q1R and the other comparisons, there is an observable distinction of the foldchange properties of the 228 genes unique to Q1R. In comparing CR to Q3R and when controls were pooled (Q1R + Q3R and Q1R + Q2R + Q3R), these 228 genes no longer met the DEG classification thresholds (Figure 6c). These results demonstrated that the KFT setup successfully detected plant responses to gravity changes, though using the appropriate controls can help distinguish between the clinostat response and the likely accumulation of hypoxic stress and/or other environmental stimuli seen when using Q1R as a control (Figure 4). Figure 6. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.In leaves, the variations between the comparisons were not as pronounced as those seen in the roots but a similar trend was observed. A total of 238 DEGs were detected in at least one comparison (Figure 7a). Of these DEGs, a substantial number were shared across the various comparisons. The Venn diagram (Figure 7b) showed that 8 genes (3.4%) were shared across all comparisons, 127 (53.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and CL vs. Q1L had the highest number of unique genes at 22.3% (53 genes). GO enrichment of the first 65 genes in column one, Figure 7a, showed processes such as defense-related pathways and the next set of 65 genes showed an enrichment of pathways associated with cell wall and detoxification. These processes are typically observed in gravity-related responses of Arabidopsis in previous spaceflight-related transcriptomic analyses [20,21,22,23]. In leaves, the selection of an appropriate control does not seem to have as substantial an impact as roots on capturing the clinorotation response (Figure 7c, Table S5). Figure 7. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in leaves. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for two clusters of genes. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [24,25]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [26]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method.",

KFTs were actuated, filling the sample compartment with RNAlater. Plants were allowed to imbibe in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 h. After fixation, seedlings were harvested at each timepoint and each KFT, with the plants on the two coupons within each KFT divided into three biological replicates. For each sample, roots and leaves were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. 3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth Root tissues from four replicate KFTs (Q1A-D) and one Petri dish (Q1P) were analyzed to investigate how plants responded to living within the KFTs for three hours and fifty minutes, in order to assay the effects of preflight sealing into the KFTs. The four KFTs showed a total of 163, 201, 139, and 178 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), when compared to Q1P, the samples taken directly from the Petri plates (Figure 3a). The composition of DEGs in the Q1A-D KFT replicates compared to Q1P showed a substantial number of similarities, with 45.7% of DEGs shared by at least two comparisons of KFT versus Q1P Petri plate (Figure 3b). In addition, a pairwise comparison between replicates showed an average of only 23 DEGs (Table 1), suggesting that growth conditions with each of the KFTs had little variation. This observation of reproducibility across four individual KFT replicates was also highlighted in the trends observed in the gene expression heatmap (Figure 3c, Table S1). Across all four KFT replicates, DEGs that were significantly altered in at least one comparison had the same regulatory trend across all the KFTs. This is indicated by the consistent Log fold change coloration in any given gene row of the heatmap. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the list of 244 DEGs upregulated in root tissue grown in KFTs compared to the plate showed an enrichment for ethylene response. Figure 3.

Therefore, an upregulation of ethylene is probable when compared to plants grown on the Q1P Petri plate. In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [19]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data. 3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile The intent of the time-course experiment that modeled a suborbital flight profile was to investigate plant transcriptomic profiles in the KFTs over the time it takes to complete a suborbital flight, and to access how to best establish ground controls. KFT’s were loaded and sealed at T-4 h prior to the T+0 timepoint. Root tissues (R) harvested from the KFTs actuated at coast start (Q2R), coast end (Q3R), and landing (Q4R) were compared to the control Q1R (T-10 min) In roots, there was an increase in the number of DEGs over time with 123, 183, and 240 DEGs reported for Q2R vs. Q1R, Q3R vs. Q1R, and Q4R vs. Q1R, respectively (Figure 4a). Interestingly, more than 50% of all the reported DEGs were unique to each time point (Figure 4b). This observation suggests that over time, different genes in the root tissues were engaged or repressed to acclimate growing in the KFT environment. However, trends in the gene expression pattern (Figure 4c, Table S2), demonstrate genes in all three time points behaved similarly. GO analysis of the upregulated genes showed that genes associated with hypoxia were enriched across all three time points. Analysis of the 256 DEGs including the 199 downregulated genes across all time points showed no significant GO enrichment associated with biological processes (Figure 4c). By comparing plant responses in KFTs for different durations to the KFT vs. plate study, it validates that the absence of gas exchange is the dominant response root tissues adapt to. Figure 4.

Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. The red box highlights GO enrichments that are associated with hypoxia responses.In leaf tissues (L), 114 DEGs were identified in the Q2L vs. Q1L comparison, followed by 36 DEGs in Q3L vs. Q1L, and 38 DEGs in Q4L vs. Q1L (Figure 5a). These results suggest that the leaf tissues do not have as much of a response to being in the KFTs when compared to the root tissues. The deceasing number of DEGs over time (Figure 5a), suggests that leaves might be adapting quickly to the KFT environment. From the number of DEGs seen in each comparison, a large proportion (>90%) were unique to each time-point, with very little overlap (Figure 5b). However, looking at the trends of the gene expression heatmap of all DEGs across all time points, several distinct clusters are observed (Figure 5c, Table S3). In the first cluster, genes were generally upregulated across all the time points and GO enrichment analysis indicated that these set of 49 genes were associated with responses to fructose. The second cluster of 60 genes showed varying regulation of gene expression across the time points with GO enrichments indicating responses to light and photosynthesis. The third cluster showed 70 genes that were generally downregulated across all the time points. GO enrichment showed genes that were downregulated in the third cluster were associated with responses to stimuli. Among these, light associated responses were striking and could be explained by the altered light conditions when plants were inserted into KFTs. The thickness and slight opaqueness of the material used to construct the KFT might cause a reduction of light reaching the plants. Overall, the hypoxic responses in roots and light-related signaling in leaves were the most observable influence on plants when grown in the KFT for a short period of time. Figure 5.

Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. Clinostat roots (CR) compared to the various root controls (Q3R, Q1R, combined Q1R + Q3R, and pooled Q1R + Q2R + Q3R) revealed that although gene expression trends were similar across all comparisons, using the appropriate controls can better segregate between gravity-related responses from other confounding responses (Figure 6). In root tissues, a total of 369 genes showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison (Figure 6a). In this experimental design, Q1 was designated as a sample point before “launch”. The root tissues in CR were in the KFT 18 min longer than Q1R and showed a substantial number of unique DEGs not observed in the other controls, which had GO enrichment mainly involved in temperature stimulus and abiotic stress responses (Figure 6a). The overlaps of the significant DEGs between each comparison showed 11 (3%) genes shared by all comparisons, 79 (21.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and 267 (72.4%) genes were unique to Q1R (Figure 6b). The gene expression trends showed that the majority of the 369 genes shared similar expression profiles regardless of the control used (Figure 6c, Table S4). Comparing the gene expression trends between CR versus Q1R and the other comparisons, there is an observable distinction of the foldchange properties of the 228 genes unique to Q1R. In comparing CR to Q3R and when controls were pooled (Q1R + Q3R and Q1R + Q2R + Q3R), these 228 genes no longer met the DEG classification thresholds (Figure 6c). These results demonstrated that the KFT setup successfully detected plant responses to gravity changes, though using the appropriate controls can help distinguish between the clinostat response and the likely accumulation of hypoxic stress and/or other environmental stimuli seen when using Q1R as a control (Figure 4). Figure 6. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.In leaves, the variations between the comparisons were not as pronounced as those seen in the roots but a similar trend was observed. A total of 238 DEGs were detected in at least one comparison (Figure 7a). Of these DEGs, a substantial number were shared across the various comparisons. The Venn diagram (Figure 7b) showed that 8 genes (3.4%) were shared across all comparisons, 127 (53.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and CL vs. Q1L had the highest number of unique genes at 22.3% (53 genes). GO enrichment of the first 65 genes in column one, Figure 7a, showed processes such as defense-related pathways and the next set of 65 genes showed an enrichment of pathways associated with cell wall and detoxification. These processes are typically observed in gravity-related responses of Arabidopsis in previous spaceflight-related transcriptomic analyses [20,21,22,23]. In leaves, the selection of an appropriate control does not seem to have as substantial an impact as roots on capturing the clinorotation response (Figure 7c, Table S5). Figure 7. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in leaves. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison.

(b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [24,25]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [26]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method.",
    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions The increased accessibility of space is crucial for the advancement of science and technology that will enable humanity to meet the goals of living on the moon and Mars. Suborbital flights now allow civilian passengers to travel to space and back, presenting a unique opportunity for scientists to perform human-tended research. The intent of this investigation is to develop a method that will enable scientists to perform hands-on plant molecular biology experiments efficiently in the suborbital environment, thereby broadening the platforms from which investigators can conduct space-related experiments. KFTs have been used to fix samples in orbital space in a wider variety of biological systems for a decade or so, but have never been used as a vessel to house samples to space. The data presented herein suggest that KFTs can be readily adapted for carrying biological samples to space in a safely contained fashion. In addition, these data suggest that the changes in plant biology that do occur upon sealing within the KFTs are manageable within the flight timelines and experiment profile, provided that comprehensive ground controls are enacted. Plants grown in the thoroughly enclosed KFTs can maintain consistent plant health for several hours, thus, providing ample time to prepare and conduct a human-tended experiment onboard the suborbital flight. Moreover, plants within KFTs exhibited robust changes in gene expression when clinorotated during the simulated microgravity portion of a suborbital flight, suggesting the potential for capturing transcriptomic responses to the actual high g and microgravity portions of a suborbital flight. This method of prepping biology to be housed in KFTs and then using KFTs for suborbital flight experiments should provide a tractable initialization of hands-on research in suborbital space.",

Copyright notice ID: 9693084 PMID: 36431005 Abstract Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.

Introduction The commercial suborbital spaceflight industry enables customers to reach the cusp of space and experience microgravity for several minutes before returning to Earth. The two main companies at the forefront of suborbital space efforts are Blue Origin (BO) and Virgin Galactic (VG). The two companies use different vehicles for their suborbital launches. Blue Origin flies New Shepard, a vertical rocket with a Crew Capsule. Virgin Galactic flies SpaceShipTwo, a rocket plane that is carried to high altitude before being dropped for launch. As such, the two providers present different modes of operations, different customer experiences and different flight profiles. Common features of both suborbital providers are a high g launch, minutes of microgravity conditions, followed by a high g re-entry. Although, the providers have different flight and gravity profiles, they both enable approximately three minutes of unmitigated microgravity [1,2]. It is those minutes of microgravity that are of high interest to science. From a biological researcher’s perspective, three minutes of high-quality microgravity opens the possibility to conduct a myriad of experiments—including but not limited to testing hardware capability, validating hypothesis, and understanding biological responses of not only microgravity, but the entirety of the spaceflight profile. Even though providers currently offer researchers an opportunity to send payloads on suborbital flight, there are severe limitations in that the untended experiment payloads are required to be contained in a locker, under fully autonomously controlled without the ability of the scientist to monitor and adjust for unforeseen situations. Thus, human suborbital spaceflight provides a promising complementary opportunity for researchers to conduct human-tended microgravity-related experiments using human capabilities that can better recapitulate a laboratory bench experiment than can an automated locker payload. Sampling biological responses at various phases of flight for subsequent analysis would be a natural initial experiment to understand biology responses to suborbital space. Plants being sessile in nature have evolved mechanisms to rapidly respond to their environment. Early transcriptomic responses have been investigated in response to various stresses such as; oxidative stress, heat stress, pathogen attack, and water stress [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Suborbital flights allow for the investigation of how plants quickly respond to transitions in varying gravity forces. To conduct such an experiment, there are several parameters that need to be considered. The rapid transitions into and out of microgravity occur within minutes, thus there is limited time for sample preparations and fixation. Plants should be poised and ready in a medium that confers as little confounding stresses as possible and upon exposure to the changes in gravity, and then be easily and rapidly preserved for proper biochemical analysis. Samples and fixatives should be triple contained and compact in size so that the hardware can be easily stowed during the flight. In addition, the acts of human tended fixation of the samples should be able to be completed rapidly. This paper describes a ground-based experiment setup that was developed to meet the needs for conducting a human tended plant biology experiments in a suborbital flight. This method highlights the expanded use of KSC Fixation Tubes as both houses for biology and for the subsequent fixation of that biology. The paper also discusses best practices for both experiment setup and conducting a RNAseq analysis to reliably report on the transcriptome of plant samples at various stages of a suborbital flight profile.2. Materials & Methods 2.1. Plant Growth Conditions Wet-sterilized Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates comprised of the coupon inlaid with 1% Phytagel/0.5× MS media. Plants were grown under a broad-spectrum LED light bank (100 µmoles/m2) for approximately 24-h the first three days. On day 3, plates were moved to dark storage (to simulate travel to launch locations) where they spent 8 h, before being transferred to a growth unit (Danby #DFG17A1B, Montreal, QC, Canada) which is used at remote locations for plant growth. The Danby provided 24 h of approximately 80 µmoles/m2 of light for another 4 days.2.2. Plant Dissection and RNA Extraction From each condition, two individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and a total of three biological replicates were obtained from two coupons in each KFT. Leaves, hypocotyls, and roots from each set were dissected under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for downstream applications, whereas the intervening hypocotyls were set aside. RNA extraction was performed using Qiagen RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany catalog #74904) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).2.3. RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation First, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, catalog #E7490). Then, followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) with 2/3 of poly A enriched RNA and 1/10 reaction volume using SPT Labtech mosquito LV liquid handling instrument. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 15 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). Barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration for sequencing aiming for 60 million reads per sample with total of 1 lane of NovaSeq S4 2 × 150 cycles run. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, accessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019145). The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 × 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, assessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019152).2.4. Illumina NovaSeq6000 Sequencing Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950 Gb) with an average Q30% ≥ 92.5% and Cluster PF = 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal.2.5. Bioinformatics Pipeline and Gene Ontology Analysis Reads acquired from the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform were cleaned up with the cutadapt program [10] to trim off sequencing adaptors and low-quality bases with a quality phred-like score < 20. Reads <40 bases were excluded from RNA-seq analysis. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (version TAIR10.51) from TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) was used as the reference sequences for RNA-seq analysis. The cleaned reads of each sample were mapped to the reference sequences using the read mapper of the STAR package (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference, v2.7.9a) [11]. The mapping results were processed with the HTSeq (High-Throughput Sequence Analysis in Python, v0.11.2) [12] samtools, and scripts developed in house at ICBR of UF to remove potential PCR duplicates, choose and count uniquely mapped reads for gene expression analysis. The counted reads of each gene were analyzed by a DESeq2-based R pipeline. Significant up- and down-regulated genes were selected using the threshold of −1.0 < Log2FoldChange < 1.0 and p-value ≤ 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using g:GOSt (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost, accessed on 11 November 2022.) with default settings to obtain terms of GO biological process.3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Optimizing Plant Growth Conditions within the KFT The original purpose of the KFT was to allow astronauts in space to apply fixative or other chemical compounds that are often toxic to biological samples without the use of a microgravity glovebox while maintaining three levels of containment [13]. For example, KFTs have been used in the past to fix plant samples from a number of spaceflight plant biological experiments [14,15,16,17,18]. The dimensions of the sample compartment of the KFT (Figure 1a) were 22.1 mm (diameter) × 62.8 mm (depth). Figure 1.

(ii) Image of pre-actuated KFT. (iii) Image of actuated KFT with samples fixed in RNAlater.The general application has been that the astronaut would remove a biological sample from its growth container and transfer the biology to the KFT sample tube. Once the sample was in the KFT, the KFT was sealed, and the fixative was brought into contact with the sample by activating the KFT mechanism [15]. However, for use in the short timeframes of suborbital flights, the KFTs need to be sealed before flight. This requirement necessitates that the biology be installed into the KFTs as part of a preflight procedure, and the KFT therefore becomes a biology incubator before it is activated to fix the sample. This allows the KFT to serve its purpose of containment safety for the entirety of the suborbital flight. Many previous plant molecular biology spaceflight-related experiments utilized Petri dishes containing a matrix nutrient gel to grow plants on the ISS in a variety of plant growth hardware systems (i.e., BRIC, Biological Research in Canister; ABRS, Advanced Biological Research System; EMCS, European Modular Cultivation System; Veggie). Typically, these plates are taped closed with a porous surgical Micropore® 3M™ tape, that allows for gas exchange, allowing plants to grow in this configuration for up to fourteen days. To ensure that plants are kept healthy, intact, and experience minimal stress responses when deployed into the KFTs, plants were grown for 7 days on wire mesh coupons suspended into growth media within the 100 mm square Petri plate. The details to construct the deployable coupon are as follows. First, 0.425 mm stainless steel wire mesh (Yikai, UPC: 615435104645) was cut into 22 mm by 62 mm sections, with one short end rounded and bent for holding. The mesh coupons were then autoclaved. The square Petri plates were poured with 10 mL of media, allowed to slightly cool, and then the wire mesh coupons were laid on the solidified media. Finally, 15 mL of media was added to the dish to cover the tops of the coupons. Sterilized seeds were planted approximately 5 mm below the bend in the coupons and were grown vertically to allow roots to grow down the coupons (Figure 1a). When ready for placement into KFTs, the media and coupons with plants on the surface were cut out and carefully placed into the KFT (Supplementary Video Data S1). As the internal diameter of the KFT’s sample chamber is the same size as the width of the coupons, the edge of the entire length and base of the coupon is supported by the KFT resulting in an exact fit. Each KFT can hold two coupons, back-to-back, with a total of six 7-day old Arabidopsis plants on each. The bottom chamber of the KFT is filled with ~25 mL of RNAlater and upon actuation of the plunger, RNAlater flows into the sample chamber and the fixation of the plants is immediately initiated [14,15]. A simulation of a simple suborbital flight profile was used in this ground-based study to investigate the responses of plants grown in the KFTs over a time period roughly similar to the flight profiles for both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. To initiate pre-flight sample preparation, plants on coupons were inserted into the experiment KFTs, the KFTs were sealed by inserting the actuators, and all KFTs were placed in the vertical orientation (Supplementary Video Data S2). This simulates the preparation of biology into the KFTs to be ready for transport and installation into the spacecraft. KFTs were that left in the vertical orientation and not disturbed through the time course were referred to as Quiescent (Q), (Figure 2). After the KFT’s were set up and sealed, they were left to rest for 3 h and 50 min, to model a reasonably long time prior to launch. During actual launch operations, this would the time that the samples would be required to undergo check-out and hand off to vehicle loading procedures for flight operations. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Setup of KFTs for simulated suborbital spaceflight profile. (a) Image of KFTs loaded with coupons and actuated after the respective timepoints. (b) Four time points of quiescent (Q1–Q4) and one set of treatment on clinostat (C) from Q2 to Q3, seedlings were harvested. Another set of four KFTs were used for comparison with a Petri dish control at Q1. The tissues were fixed in RNAlater overnight and then dissected to roots and leaves, which were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. (c) Image of KFT mounted on a 2-D Clinostat.Samples at Q1 (T-10 min, 3 h 50 min after sealing in the KFTs) were actuated and fixed 10 min before the mock launch timepoint (T+0). Additionally, at the T-10 min timepoint, an additional set of four KFTs (Q1A, Q1B, Q1C and Q1D) were actuated to assess the variability and reproducibility of the plant transcriptome simply from being housed for that amount of time in the KFTs. To understand how this methodology differs from the standard Petri dish configuration typically used in spaceflight experiments, the plant transcriptome obtained from each of the four Q1 KFTs (Q1A-D) were compared to the transcriptome from a Petri dish control at the same T-10 min timepoint. Through the remainder of the time course, one KFT was used for each timepoint. Samples Q2, Q3, and Q4 were actuated 4 min, 8 min, and 18 min after T+0 mock launch, which mimicked the flight profile times of boost end / coast start (Q2: T+4 min), coast end (Q3: T+8 min), and landing (Q4: T+18 min), respectively. In addition, a set of samples were placed on a clinostat starting at the Q2 timepoint and fixed at the Q3 timepoint. Here, the KFT was mounted onto a 2-dimensional clinostat parallel to the plane of rotation (Figure 2c) and was rotated at 1 rpm for 4 min. Based on the radius (150 mm) of the clinostat, a rotation at 1 rpm would result in a simulated altered microgravity profile of 1.67 × 104 g. KFTs were actuated, filling the sample compartment with RNAlater. Plants were allowed to imbibe in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 h. After fixation, seedlings were harvested at each timepoint and each KFT, with the plants on the two coupons within each KFT divided into three biological replicates. For each sample, roots and leaves were subjected to RNA-seq analysis.3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth Root tissues from four replicate KFTs (Q1A-D) and one Petri dish (Q1P) were analyzed to investigate how plants responded to living within the KFTs for three hours and fifty minutes, in order to assay the effects of preflight sealing into the KFTs. The four KFTs showed a total of 163, 201, 139, and 178 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), when compared to Q1P, the samples taken directly from the Petri plates (Figure 3a). The composition of DEGs in the Q1A-D KFT replicates compared to Q1P showed a substantial number of similarities, with 45.7% of DEGs shared by at least two comparisons of KFT versus Q1P Petri plate (Figure 3b). In addition, a pairwise comparison between replicates showed an average of only 23 DEGs (Table 1), suggesting that growth conditions with each of the KFTs had little variation. This observation of reproducibility across four individual KFT replicates was also highlighted in the trends observed in the gene expression heatmap (Figure 3c, Table S1). Across all four KFT replicates, DEGs that were significantly altered in at least one comparison had the same regulatory trend across all the KFTs. This is indicated by the consistent Log fold change coloration in any given gene row of the heatmap. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the list of 244 DEGs upregulated in root tissue grown in KFTs compared to the plate showed an enrichment for ethylene response. Figure 3.

Therefore, an upregulation of ethylene is probable when compared to plants grown on the Q1P Petri plate. In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [19]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data.3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile The intent of the time-course experiment that modeled a suborbital flight profile was to investigate plant transcriptomic profiles in the KFTs over the time it takes to complete a suborbital flight, and to access how to best establish ground controls. KFT’s were loaded and sealed at T-4 h prior to the T+0 timepoint. Root tissues (R) harvested from the KFTs actuated at coast start (Q2R), coast end (Q3R), and landing (Q4R) were compared to the control Q1R (T-10 min) In roots, there was an increase in the number of DEGs over time with 123, 183, and 240 DEGs reported for Q2R vs. Q1R, Q3R vs. Q1R, and Q4R vs. Q1R, respectively (Figure 4a). Interestingly, more than 50% of all the reported DEGs were unique to each time point (Figure 4b). This observation suggests that over time, different genes in the root tissues were engaged or repressed to acclimate growing in the KFT environment. However, trends in the gene expression pattern (Figure 4c, Table S2), demonstrate genes in all three time points behaved similarly. GO analysis of the upregulated genes showed that genes associated with hypoxia were enriched across all three time points. Analysis of the 256 DEGs including the 199 downregulated genes across all time points showed no significant GO enrichment associated with biological processes (Figure 4c). By comparing plant responses in KFTs for different durations to the KFT vs. plate study, it validates that the absence of gas exchange is the dominant response root tissues adapt to. Figure 4. Open in a new tab DEGs detected in at least one comparison of Q2, Q3 or Q4 vs. Q1 in roots. (a) Number of DEGs in three comparisons. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing expression patterns of 465 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. GO terms of biological processes for 209 induced genes are shown. Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. The red box highlights GO enrichments that are associated with hypoxia responses.In leaf tissues (L), 114 DEGs were identified in the Q2L vs. Q1L comparison, followed by 36 DEGs in Q3L vs. Q1L, and 38 DEGs in Q4L vs. Q1L (Figure 5a). These results suggest that the leaf tissues do not have as much of a response to being in the KFTs when compared to the root tissues. The deceasing number of DEGs over time (Figure 5a), suggests that leaves might be adapting quickly to the KFT environment. From the number of DEGs seen in each comparison, a large proportion (>90%) were unique to each time-point, with very little overlap (Figure 5b). However, looking at the trends of the gene expression heatmap of all DEGs across all time points, several distinct clusters are observed (Figure 5c, Table S3). In the first cluster, genes were generally upregulated across all the time points and GO enrichment analysis indicated that these set of 49 genes were associated with responses to fructose. The second cluster of 60 genes showed varying regulation of gene expression across the time points with GO enrichments indicating responses to light and photosynthesis. The third cluster showed 70 genes that were generally downregulated across all the time points. GO enrichment showed genes that were downregulated in the third cluster were associated with responses to stimuli. Among these, light associated responses were striking and could be explained by the altered light conditions when plants were inserted into KFTs. The thickness and slight opaqueness of the material used to construct the KFT might cause a reduction of light reaching the plants. Overall, the hypoxic responses in roots and light-related signaling in leaves were the most observable influence on plants when grown in the KFT for a short period of time. Figure 5.

Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. Clinostat roots (CR) compared to the various root controls (Q3R, Q1R, combined Q1R + Q3R, and pooled Q1R + Q2R + Q3R) revealed that although gene expression trends were similar across all comparisons, using the appropriate controls can better segregate between gravity-related responses from other confounding responses (Figure 6). In root tissues, a total of 369 genes showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison (Figure 6a). In this experimental design, Q1 was designated as a sample point before “launch”. The root tissues in CR were in the KFT 18 min longer than Q1R and showed a substantial number of unique DEGs not observed in the other controls, which had GO enrichment mainly involved in temperature stimulus and abiotic stress responses (Figure 6a). The overlaps of the significant DEGs between each comparison showed 11 (3%) genes shared by all comparisons, 79 (21.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and 267 (72.4%) genes were unique to Q1R (Figure 6b). The gene expression trends showed that the majority of the 369 genes shared similar expression profiles regardless of the control used (Figure 6c, Table S4). Comparing the gene expression trends between CR versus Q1R and the other comparisons, there is an observable distinction of the foldchange properties of the 228 genes unique to Q1R. In comparing CR to Q3R and when controls were pooled (Q1R + Q3R and Q1R + Q2R + Q3R), these 228 genes no longer met the DEG classification thresholds (Figure 6c). These results demonstrated that the KFT setup successfully detected plant responses to gravity changes, though using the appropriate controls can help distinguish between the clinostat response and the likely accumulation of hypoxic stress and/or other environmental stimuli seen when using Q1R as a control (Figure 4). Figure 6. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.In leaves, the variations between the comparisons were not as pronounced as those seen in the roots but a similar trend was observed. A total of 238 DEGs were detected in at least one comparison (Figure 7a). Of these DEGs, a substantial number were shared across the various comparisons. The Venn diagram (Figure 7b) showed that 8 genes (3.4%) were shared across all comparisons, 127 (53.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and CL vs. Q1L had the highest number of unique genes at 22.3% (53 genes). GO enrichment of the first 65 genes in column one, Figure 7a, showed processes such as defense-related pathways and the next set of 65 genes showed an enrichment of pathways associated with cell wall and detoxification. These processes are typically observed in gravity-related responses of Arabidopsis in previous spaceflight-related transcriptomic analyses [20,21,22,23]. In leaves, the selection of an appropriate control does not seem to have as substantial an impact as roots on capturing the clinorotation response (Figure 7c, Table S5). Figure 7. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in leaves. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for two clusters of genes. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray.Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [24,25]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [26]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method.4. Conclusions The increased accessibility of space is crucial for the advancement of science and technology that will enable humanity to meet the goals of living on the moon and Mars. Suborbital flights now allow civilian passengers to travel to space and back, presenting a unique opportunity for scientists to perform human-tended research. The intent of this investigation is to develop a method that will enable scientists to perform hands-on plant molecular biology experiments efficiently in the suborbital environment, thereby broadening the platforms from which investigators can conduct space-related experiments. KFTs have been used to fix samples in orbital space in a wider variety of biological systems for a decade or so, but have never been used as a vessel to house samples to space. The data presented herein suggest that KFTs can be readily adapted for carrying biological samples to space in a safely contained fashion. In addition, these data suggest that the changes in plant biology that do occur upon sealing within the KFTs are manageable within the flight timelines and experiment profile, provided that comprehensive ground controls are enacted. Plants grown in the thoroughly enclosed KFTs can maintain consistent plant health for several hours, thus, providing ample time to prepare and conduct a human-tended experiment onboard the suborbital flight. Moreover, plants within KFTs exhibited robust changes in gene expression when clinorotated during the simulated microgravity portion of a suborbital flight, suggesting the potential for capturing transcriptomic responses to the actual high g and microgravity portions of a suborbital flight. This method of prepping biology to be housed in KFTs and then using KFTs for suborbital flight experiments should provide a tractable initialization of hands-on research in suborbital space.Acknowledgments We thank members of UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) in Bioinformatics (RRID:SCR_019120), Gene Expression and Genotyping (RRID:SCR_019145) and NextGen DNA sequencing (RRID:SCR_019152) cores, for their support and services.

    "abstract": "Abstract Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Since the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infections during and post-spaceflight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceflight [1], and astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections [2, 3]. Published reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals [4–9]. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune function of viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value [10, 11]. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine [5, 7, 12, 13]. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards high levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding viral particles [4]. Studies on spaceflight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space flown mice and rats, and in vitro cell culture systems [14]. Several changes in cell populations have been noted immediately post-spaceflight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-cells (specifically CD4+ T-cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells [15–17]. However, reports of alterations in circulating leukocytes populations isolated from astronauts post-spaceflight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no changes in lymphocyte or monocytes populations [10, 18–21]. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to mission specific variables and individual health status. The observed changes in immune activity post-spaceflight involves both innate (macrophages and NK cells) and adaptive (T-cell) functions. This report represents the first occasion of a detailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions, this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of spaceflight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic final flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLR), the surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using agonists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist), lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation parameters included T-cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-cell receptor) and CD28 (T-cell co-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor. Analysis of mouse splenocytes focused on changes in surface marker expression for T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I and II) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact with DCs, CD8+ (MHC I) or CD4+ (MHC II) T-cells are activated by antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the influence of spaceflight on immune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell hypersensitive activity.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Flight Information: Subjects and Spaceflight This study was conducted as a subset of a larger parent flight investigation identified as Commercial Biomedical Test Module-3, designed to determine if administering an experimental agent preflight reduces the loss of bone associated with spaceflight [22]; multiple investigators shared materials collected post flight [23–27]. For the parent study, mice (“flight mice”) were flown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-135, for approximately 13 days. For this immune-specific sub-study, approximately ½ spleen from six C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, 9 weeks of age at start of flight) were made available immediately following spaceflight. The subjects were flown in a Space Shuttle Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which was housed in the mid-deck area of the vehicle for the duration of the spaceflight. Spleens from six ground-based control mice, which were handled and housed in a ground-based identical manner (AEM module) to the flight mice were included in the study. The AEM module housing conditions for control mice have been well described [28]. AEM ground control mice received vehicle control diluting agent. The mice were part of the NASA Ames Research Center’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (http://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts-135). Flight experiments were designed to investigate effects of microgravity on vascular atrophy in mouse hindlimbs. We are aware that among our six flight mouse subjects, four were treated with a bone-specific medication and two were untreated. For purposes of this article, analysis was conducted on all six flight subjects as a group, without knowledge of treatment, and data were compared to ground AEM control subjects. The individual mice that were drug or placebo treated remained unknown during experimentation; data presented here was not separated according to treatments. To our knowledge, there was no influence of medication on the data collected. Separate analysis of data did not indicate statistical outliers within the combined spaceflight mice, which would indicate affects due to treatment. In light of this, we believe our findings are relevant and important, even in light of inclusion of mice that received the bone loss experimental drug. Mouse Splenocytes Processing Animals were retrieved approximately 1 hour following deorbit, and sacrificed within 3–5 hours post flight, collected on July 21, 2011 at Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral, FL). Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguinations [28]. Half of the spleen was processed as previously described [28]. Briefly, the organ was homonenized between glass slides, RBC lysed with ACK buffer (Lonza), washed twice with 1x Cellgro Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Mediatech), and cultured in complete DMEM media [Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.05g/L of HEPES (Sigma), 0.05g/L L-arginine (Sigma), 100 μg/mL penicillin G (Sigma), 50 μg/mL gentamycin sulfate (Sigma) 0.005% 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma)] at 1x106cells/mL. Processing of splenocytes for in vitro analysis occurred within 4 hours post flight. The animal welfare committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center was consulted prior to initiation of experimentation; no protocol was required as samples used were obtained post euthanasia. All NASA activities with these mice were performed according to guidelines stipulated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as described by the National Institutes of Health. Experiments were performed after approval by review boards associated with NASA’s standard operating procedures, and as reported for tissue used in recent reports [26, 28]. Bead Uptake Assay Splenocytes were cultured with 1.0μm FluoSpheres polystyrene microsphere (Invitrogen) at ratio of 10 beads per 1 cell. At 2 hours, cells were washed with 1x PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes on ice, and stored in flow buffer (1% BSA in 1x PBS) for analysis. Stimulation Assays Isolated splenocytes were cultured for 24 hours in media alone or stimulated with 1) anti-CD3 (0.1μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (0.1μg/mL) antibodies (eBiosciences), 2) 2μg/mL Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma), 3) 200ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O111:B4, Sigma), 4) 10μg/mL Zymosan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Invivogen), or 5) 100ng/mL flagellin (Salmonella typhimurium, Invivogen). At 24 hours, supernatants were collected for ELISA and cells collected for staining of surface markers. Flow Cytometry Identification of surface molecule expression by flow cytometric analysis was conducted as previously described [29]. Briefly, samples were blocked by incubating purified anti-CD16/32 (Fc block, BD Biosciences) on ice for 15 minutes. Then, samples were stained with mouse specific T-cell markers or DC markers antibody cocktails in staining buffer (1% BSA in 1xPBS) on ice for 45–60mins. T-cell marker cocktail: CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, CD28-PECy5, CD-25-PECy7, and CTLA-4-APC. DC marker cocktail: H2Kb-FITC, I-Ab-PE, CD86-PECy5, CD11c-PECy7, and CD80-APC. Stained samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 mins. Stained and fixed samples were stored in 500μL of staining buffer. Samples were read on Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Analysis was conducted with Cyflogic. Cytokine Analysis Supernatants were analyzed by DuoSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol as previously described [29–31]. Supernatants were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and lymphocyte cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ). Lower limits of detection for the assay were between 16–32 pg/mL. Statistics Splenocytes were collected from 6 mice per group. Flow analysis counted 20,000 events per sample. ELISA analysis was conducted in duplicate or triplicate. Data was analyzed by TwoWay ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Significance is considered when p<0.05.",
    "results": "Results Splenocyte Population Changes between Flight Mice and Ground Controls Basic differentiation of splenocyte cell populations between flight mice and matched ground controls were completed by flow cytometric analysis. Forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters were noted, with the former measuring size of particle and the latter measuring granularity. Cells were assessed immediately post 13 days in flight, or following short term culture in vitro. Distinct changes in total splenocyte population were noted. Native splenocytes collected from spleens immediate upon sacrifice demonstrated two distinct cell populations, based on FS. The flight mice splenocytes selectively demonstrated presence of a third population within gate 3 (G3) with higher FS compared to ground controls (Fig 1a). Fig 1b shows representative dot plots of cell population makeup within each gate identified in Fig 1a. There are clear population differences in cells expressing CD4, CD8, MHC I and MHC II (Fig 1b). Examination of T-cell and antigen presentation cell markers on the different cell populations found that G3 cells contained a higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to G1 and G2 populations. The G3 population also had increased surface expression of MHC I compared to G1 and G2 cells (Fig 1c). This indicates that post-spaceflight mice have spleens with slightly higher CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations compared to matched ground controls. Fig 1. Cell population differences in total splenocytes collected from flight mice. Open in a new tab Splenocytes collected immediately post-spaceflight were stained with CD4, CD8, MHC I, MHC II, and CD11c. Analysis was conducted by flow cytometry. (1a) Example of gating strategy between flight mice and ground (AEM; animal enclosure module controls). (1b) Example of positive population composition of each gate identified in 1a from flight mice. (1c) Graph of percent positive and MFI from each marker of splenocytes from flight mice.Upon culture for 24 hours in cell media, relative marker expression for the splenocyte population shifted. Cultured splenocytes isolated from ground control mice exhibited an increase in cell density in G3 compared to cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice (Fig 2a). Examination revealed that G3 population has higher percentage of CD8+ and MHC I+ cells. It was also noted that G3 population also displayed increased surface expression of CD8+ as indicated by increased mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). Cell populations of G2 and G4 display surface marker expression typical of dendritic cells and macrophages (Fig 2b and 2c). These data suggests that in vitro culturing of splenocytes from ground control mice enhances relative abundance of CD8 T-cell marker expression compared to splenocytes collected from the mice post-spaceflight.

Splenocyte Markers Altered Post-Spaceflight With obvious differences in cell population observed from splenocytes collected from ground control versus flight mice within hours post-spaceflight, detailed examination of surface marker changes were conducted. In addition to changes in overall T-cell and dendritic cell populations, markers important for T-cell activation and proliferation and dendritic cell antigen presentation were also examined (Tables 1 and 2).

Bold values represent significant differences and relative p values between groups. MFI; mean fluorescent intensity. N/A; not assessed.Analysis of cell populations indicated that the majority of lymphocytes resided within the G2 and G3 gated areas. As such, examination of changes in T-cell populations was restricted to G2 and G3 events. T-cell markers of interest examined are CD4, CD8, CD28 (the second signal for T-cell activation), CD25 (IL-2 receptor), and CTLA-4 (the signal for T-cell anergy). No differences were observed in percent of splenocytes expressing these surface markers between flight and ground control mice. However, several significant changes were observed in the intensity of surface marker expression. Splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in CD4 MFI, with a concurrent increase in CD8 MFI, compared to ground controls. The intensity of CD25 expression in both CD4 and CD8 cells were significantly decreased in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 1). Little to no CTLA-4 expression was detected from any of the samples (data not shown). Examination of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules were focused on events occurring in cells gated within G1, G2, and G3. There was a significant increase in population of splenocytes expressing the dendritic cell marker (CD11c) from flight mice compared to ground controls. A similar increase was also observed in dendritic cells (CD11c+) expressing MHC I. However, a significant decrease was detected in dendritic cells co-expressing MHC II from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 2). Post-Spaceflight Splenocytes Increased Ability to Uptake Particles A central process in innate immunity is the ability to phagocytose. To examine if post-spaceflight conditions affected the ability of splenocytes to uptake particles, splenocytes were incubated with fluorescent beads, and analyzed for bead ingestion conducted by flow cytometry. Three distinct populations for positive bead uptake were detected, and labeled as low, medium, high according to florescent intensity (FI). Cells from G1, G2, and G3 were considered as one population and distinguished only by FI. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in percent positive cells at low and medium FI, and a non-significant increase at high FI compared to ground controls (Fig 3). Fig 3. Bead uptake by splenocytes from flight mice and ground controls. Open in a new tab Splenocytes were incubate with fluorescent beads and collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Percent positive events were separated by peak mean florescent intensity and labeled as low, med, and high. Data was plotted for each individual mouse. Mean indicated by dotted line (ground AEM control) or solid line (flight mice). *** = p<0.001; **p = <0.01 Changes in T-cell Surface Molecules upon Stimulation Next, changes in T-cells surface marker expression post stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and Concanavalin A (ConA) were examined. The total population of CD4+ cells was significantly decreased in splenocytes collected from flight mice in all cultured conditions (media control, CD3/28, or ConA) compared to ground controls. Additionally, stimulation of cultured cells also caused a downward trend of CD4 expressing cells compared to culturing in media control (Fig 4a). There was no significant difference in cell population expressing both CD4 and CD28 (Fig 4b). Stimulation with ConA dramatically increased the CD4+CD25+ population, with a significant decrease observed in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 4c). A similar increase in CD4 cell population co-expressing CD28 and CD25 was observed during ConA stimulation. An unexpected finding was that CD4+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated and increase in CD28/25 co-expressing cells compared to ground controls (Fig 4d). Fig 4. Surface markers expression of CD4+ splenocytes. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with only media (control), anti-CD3/CD28, or ConA. Cells were collected and stained for expression of CD4, CD28, and CD25. (A) CD4 positive cells in total splenocyte population. (B) CD4+CD28+ cells. (C) CD4+CD25+ cells. (D) CD4+ cells that are also CD28+CD25+. *** = p<0.001 **p = <0.01; * = p<0.05Previous observations in our laboratory demonstrated that the action of in vitro culturing leads to altered cell population (non-published observation). For example, simple in vitro culturing of splenocytes in media alters intensity of CD8 expression. This was now examined in the post-flight group. After 24 hours in cell media, splenocytes, from both flight and ground controls, developed two distinct CD8+ cell populations based on mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). The populations were termed CD8lo+ and CD8hi+. Upon stimulation with ConA for 24 hours, this distinction disappears and most of the CD8+ splenocytes are CD8lo+ (Fig 5). Fig 5. Expression of CD8 on non-activated and ConA activated splenocytes. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with or without ConA (2μg/mL). Cells were collected and stained for expression of CD8. Representative flow dot graphs of CD8 positive populations after 24 hours culture in media only (left) or in the presence of ConA (right).Examination of CD8 expression during stimulation is divided between CD8lo and CD8hi populations. There is little if any change in CD8 expression among the media control and CD3/28 and Con A stimulated groups. However, CD8hi expression is very low after stimulation with ConA. No significant differences between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls in all culture conditions. The exception is the observation of a significant increase in CD25+CD28+ expression of CD8+ T-cells from splenocytes of flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 6). Fig 6. Expression of surface markers of CD8lo and CD8hi splenocytes. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with only media (control), anti-CD3/CD28, or ConA. Cells were collected and stained for expression of CD8, CD28, and CD25. *** = p<0.001 **p = <0.01; * = p<0.05 Presentation and Activation Molecule Changes in Splenocytes during TLR Stimulation Effective immunity against pathogens relies on innate recognition of molecular patterns and activation of antigen presentation. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are well characterized pattern recognition receptors that initiate activation of the innate response. Using agonists for TLR-2 (Zymosan), TLR-4 (LPS), and TLR-5 (flagellin), splenocytes were stimulated for 24 hours and analyzed for surface expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Surface expression of MHC I from flight mice or ground controls demonstrated two distinct populations. One population exhibited low intensity of MHC I expression that is well confined to G3. The other population had a diverse intensity range of MHC I expression that was generally higher compared to those in G2 (Fig 7a). Analysis of MHC I allowed grouping into MHC Ilo (G3) and MHC Ihi (G2) populations. In percent population analysis of MHC I expression, no differences were observed for any of the TLR agonist conditions between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls. Interestingly, there was an across the board decrease of MHC I MFI from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls in the G2 (MHC Ihi) population. This trend was completely reversed in the G3 (MHC Ilo) population in MHC I MFI, with splenocytes from flight mice demonstrating a significant increase in expression intensity compared to ground controls (Fig 7b). No differences were observed in expression of MHC II between flight mice and ground controls (data not shown). Fig 7. Antigen presentation molecule expression under TLR agonist stimulation. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without TLR agonists for 24 hours. Cells were collected and stained for expression of MHC I (H-2kb) and MHC II (I-Ab). (7a) Representative dot plot of MHC I+ populations. (7b) Percent positive and MFI of MHC I expression from G2 and G3 populations. *** = p<0.001.Expression of CD11c, a mouse dendritic cell marker, showed that splenocytes from flight mice had a global decrease in expression of CD11c positive cells under all culture conditions (Fig 8a). These dendritic cell populations were investigated for expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. CD11c+MCHI+ cells were decreased in both percent population and intensity of MHC I expression in all culture conditions in flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Fig 8b). CD11c+MHCII+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated increased in percent population and intensity of MHC II expression compared to ground controls (Fig 8c). There was little difference between flight mice and ground controls in CD11c+CD86+ splenocytes, except a significant decrease in CD11c+CD86+ cells under TLR-5 stimulation (Fig 8d). Finally, there was very low overall expression of CD80 (data not shown). Fig 8. Dendritic cell populations changes after TLR stimulation in post-spaceflight mice. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without TLR agonists for 24 hours.

Cytokine Production from Stimulated Splenocytes Post-Spaceflight The changes in surface expression of T-cell activation molecules, as well as dendritic cell antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules, during stimulation indicated potential functional dysregulation caused by spaceflight. Cytokine production during stimulation is often used to determine cell activity. Supernatants from splenocytes stimulated with T-cell stimulants or TLR agonists were further examined for cytokine production by ELISA. Stimulation with ConA demonstrated a non-significant trend of increased IFN-γ production and a concurrent decrease in IL-2 production from flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Table 3). TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists also stimulated an increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 from splenocytes isolated from flight mice versus ground controls. Only the increase in TNF-α induced by TLR-2 agonist represented a significant difference (Table 4). Little (below the level of detection of the assay) to no TNF-α and IL-6 were produced when stimulated with TLR-5 agonist (data not shown). Table 3.

    "discussion": "Discussion The immune dysfunction post-spaceflight is well documented. This disruption in immune activity is believed to be partly responsible for observed spaceflight and post-flight related incidence of immune-related adverse health events that may occur during spaceflight. With future plans for longer duration space travel, the question of how changes in host immunity would affect overall crew health needs to be addressed. The experiments conducted in this report focused on changes that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. This bridge is crucial to generating long-term memory protection against infection, and critical for mounting immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. Specifically, this report investigated the ability of dendritic cells (DC) to respond to stimulation through TLRs, and T-cell responsiveness through the T-cell receptor. To determine baseline receptor expression, the splenocytes were stained upon landing. These native expressions found no differences observed in the percent population changes of CD4 or CD8 T cells, with results reflecting similar findings from published works showing no changes in percent population of CD4 or CD8 T cells in rodents post-spaceflight [32–34]. Other reports show mixed changes. Specifically, some have identified increases in CD4 and CD8 populations [35–38], others show decreased CD4 and CD8 populations [39, 40], and others have shown a combination thereof [10] post-flight. Pecaut, et al. demonstrated that there was indeed a shift in leukocyte phenotypes to different organs, which may affect localization of response [41]. Likewise, conflicting reports are found from peripheral blood of astronauts post-flight [15, 16, 18, 20]. Some of these differences were attributed to the type of lymph organ examined, as thymus cells usually shows no change in CD4 and CD8 T cells populations while splenocytes do exhibit differences between flight animals and ground controls [36]. The seemingly contradictory evidence could be explained by different gating strategies used to determine percent positivity of events. The study presented here showed that splenocytes from mice post-flight demonstrated an increase in a cell population with high percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. While previous reports only examined percent positive populations, this study included examination of marker intensity, which was interpreted to indicate an increase in marker expression per cell. There was a significant decrease in the intensity of CD4 and an increase in intensity of CD8 expression on a per cell basis. Since CD4 and CD8 molecules play a role during T-cell recognition of antigen presentation by binding to the antigen presentation molecules, MHC I, MHC II, or CD1, any change in their surface expression could affect the avidity potential to alter T-cell stimulation. Indeed, the avidity/affinity model of peripheral T-cell regulation suggests that changes in CD4 and CD8 expression affect T-cell activation. CD8lo cells require higher avidity of T-cell receptor and MHC I interactions for activation [42] and control/suppress other CD8 T-cell responsiveness to antigen [43]. This study also found splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in intensity of CD25 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells compared to ground controls. CD25 is the IL-2 receptor, which is often used as a marker to denote regulatory T-cells. However, this decrease in CD25 intensity is not interpreted to indicate a change in regulatory T-cell post-flight, especially because the population of CD25+ splenocytes did not change. The CD25 ligand, IL-2, is the T-cell proliferating factor. Experiments on the Jurkat T cell line post-flight demonstrated a lack of proliferation and elevations of Fas/APO-1, suggesting spaceflight conditions induced apoptosis in T-cells [44, 45]. The decrease in CD25 expression on a per cell basis suggests that flight splenocytes downregulate factors for proliferation. And it has been clearly demonstrated that immediate early genes of lymphocytes are affected under conditions of microgravity [46]. Dendritic cells are the primary antigen presenting cells to bridge innate and adaptive immunity. DCs respond to invading pathogens, prime and activate antigen specific T-cells, and promote development of antigen specific memory. In the mouse, expression of CD11c, a β2 integrin, is a marker for DC identification. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in CD11c+ population compared to ground controls, suggesting an enhancement of the DC population. This is the first reported change of spaceflight on DC population dynamics. Interestingly, previous published reports examining another β2 integrin, CD11b, showed a decrease population change, interpreted as a decrease in monocytes/macrophages [40], which was also observed using CD14/16 markers for identification [10]. As with T-cells, spaceflight conditions were also reported to increased monocyte/macrophage population [15, 16]. Similar to T-cell subsets, macrophages and dendritic cells populations have differential proliferation results in response to spaceflight. Examination of MHC I and II presentation molecule expression found that CD11c+ splenocytes post-flight had a significant increase in MHC I+ and a significant decrease in MHC II+ populations compared to ground controls. There are limited reports on antigen presentation molecule expression, and both published articles also found a decrease in class II presentation molecules expressing populations [47, 48]. These results confirm that spaceflight alters class II presentation molecule expression, which may indicate a diminution in the potential to effectively present antigens to CD4+ T-cells. Splenocytes post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase in bead uptake compared to ground controls. This is the first report that flight conditions influence particle uptake. The implications suggest that spaceflight does not hinder particle uptake, and may even enhance the function. However, it is not clear how alteration of particulate uptake would affect host immune status. Limited hindlimb suspension model studies may shed light on this, if one takes the assumption that uptake of pathogenic organisms are similar to that of beads. In those studies, in vivo infection found no change in clearance of rotavirus [49] and a decrease in bacterial clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [50] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [51]. This suggests that other immune effects resulting from spaceflight contribute to clearance dysfunction, even if there are increased uptake events of particulates. Overall, this is difficult to assess, and we realize that beads travel along different phagocytic pathways than the agents mentioned. Development of effective immunity towards pathogens relies on responding to innate signals. The toll-like receptors (TLR) are well established pattern recognition receptors stimulated by pathogenic motifs [52]. The most commonly used TLR ligand to investigate spaceflight effect on cell function is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In humans, blood cells isolated during spaceflight responded to LPS by increasing production of IL-8, however, this finding resolved upon post-spaceflight examination [18]. LPS has also shown to promote lower production of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 and increased IL-1β post-spaceflight in humans [47]. Reports in mice show a mixed response when looking a whole splenocyte populations [53]. Purified macrophages flow in space demonstrated an increase in both IL-1 and TNF-α production in response to LPS [54]. While that report did not observe a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation, the flight splenocytes did exhibit a trend of increase in TNF-α and IL-6 production compared to ground controls. The data presented here extended observations to include cytokine production with the TLR-2/6 and TLR-5 ligands, zymosan (fungal) and flagellin (bacterial) respectively. Zymosan stimulated a significant increase in TNF-α; no cytokine changes were observed upon flagellin stimulation. Chapes et al. investigated stimulation with poly I:C, a TLR-3 ligand, and found an increase in IFN-α [54]. For the most part, flight exposure did not have a deleterious effect on TLR activation and stimulation, suggesting that the innate immune inflammatory response remains intact. Few published articles have examined changes in surface expression of presentation and co-stimulatory molecules after TLR stimulation. While cytokine production is an important indicator of immune response, the main effect of how DCs response to TLR stimulation is to increase antigen presentation and stimulate T-cells [55]. Splenocytes demonstrated similar changes DC surface molecule expression post flight, regardless of TLR stimulation. For example, the DC population from the flight mice had altered MHC I and MHC II expressing populations compared to ground controls, even in cultures that did not receive TLR-agonist stimulation. Regarding adaptive immune functions, T-cells are critical for control of re-infection and re-activation events. Unlike DCs, the effect post-spaceflight on T-cell activity has been well documented. Stimulating with anti-CD3/CD28, which simulates T-cell activation by antigen presenting cells, resulted in increased IFN-γ and decreased IL-2 [18, 56]. ConA stimulation, which stimulates T-cells through the T-cell receptor without requiring the secondary signal (CD28), resulted in no change or increased IL-2 [36, 57], increased IL-3, and decreased IFN-γ [58]. Use of other mitogens, such as PHA or PMA/Ionomycin, that stimulates by bypassing both the T-cell and co-stimulatory receptors, led to no change or decreased IL-2 [10, 57], decreased IFN-γ [10] and decreased TNF-α [18]. The data in this report reflects some differences in reported observations, although in line with that reported by Gridley, et al. [59]. Rather, the results reported here for ConA stimulation demonstrated a non-significant increase in IFN-γ and decreased IL-2. The discrepancy in cytokine results could be differences in cell culture number, concentration of stimulants, and time of stimulation. Surface molecule expression was examined in stimulated T-cells. Little or no differences were observed in the flight mice versus ground controls, with two notable exceptions. Regardless of stimulation parameters, the cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice were significantly depressed in their expression of CD4. Second, while expression of CD8 intensity immediately post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase on a per cell basis, further in vitro culture of cells distinctively identified two sets of CD8 cells, CD8lo and CD8hi. This distinction disappeared upon ConA stimulation. Indeed, the flight mice splenocytes evidenced a significant increase in CD4 or CD8 T-cells that also expressed CD25 or CD25/28. Therefore, it is important for future studies to define gating strategies, as we have done here. We suggest that CD25, along with CD69, are used as markers of early T-cell activation. Short-term spaceflight increased expression of CD25/69 when stimulated with anti-CD3/28 [20]. The results with ConA may indicate that flight mice could demonstrate increased early T-cell activation upon stimulation, compared to ground controls. Our report focused on phenotypic alterations that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses crucial for generating protective immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. It would indeed be important to understand how long the phenotypic changes were sustained post flight; analysis of genetic alterations or changes in methylation status would certainly be warranted. The condition of the spaceflight environment has been shown to alter cytosine methylation patterns to generate heritable epigenetic changes in rice. Both hypo- and hypermethylation events can occur, with concurrent dysregulation of gene expression. Genes for DNA methyltransferases were very sensitive to spaceflight conditions [60, 61]. Similar effects were identified in microgravity studies in human lymphocytes [62, 63], where both DNA methylation genes, as well as histone acetylation genes, were affected. In addition, DNA repair mechanisms were also diminished. Overall this suggests both an accumulation of damaged DNA as well as the potential for inheritable and sustainable changes in cellular phenotypic activity. In conclusion, there exists a large body of evidence that spaceflight does impact T-cell activity and cause global suppression in response to multiple stimulants. Indeed, these “type IV hypersensitive” class responses have been found to be reduced to a variety of antigens during and post spaceflight [14, 64]. The data from this study shed additional light towards molecular mechanisms involved in immune changes induced by spaceflight that could alter activation of innate and adaptive immunity, at least post flight. It remains to be determined if these changes may also impact responses during active flight. Given the limited number of subjects for spaceflight studies, future analysis should continue to examine both innate (DC) and adaptive (T-cell) responses.",

Copyright notice ID: 4430214 PMID: 25970640 Abstract Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro.Introduction Since the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infections during and post-spaceflight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceflight [1], and astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections [2, 3]. Published reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals [4–9]. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune function of viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value [10, 11]. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine [5, 7, 12, 13]. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards high levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding viral particles [4]. Studies on spaceflight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space flown mice and rats, and in vitro cell culture systems [14]. Several changes in cell populations have been noted immediately post-spaceflight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-cells (specifically CD4+ T-cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells [15–17]. However, reports of alterations in circulating leukocytes populations isolated from astronauts post-spaceflight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no changes in lymphocyte or monocytes populations [10, 18–21]. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to mission specific variables and individual health status. The observed changes in immune activity post-spaceflight involves both innate (macrophages and NK cells) and adaptive (T-cell) functions. This report represents the first occasion of a detailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions, this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of spaceflight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic final flight of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLR), the surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using agonists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist), lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation parameters included T-cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-cell receptor) and CD28 (T-cell co-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor. Analysis of mouse splenocytes focused on changes in surface marker expression for T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I and II) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact with DCs, CD8+ (MHC I) or CD4+ (MHC II) T-cells are activated by antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the influence of spaceflight on immune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell hypersensitive activity.Materials and Methods Flight Information: Subjects and Spaceflight This study was conducted as a subset of a larger parent flight investigation identified as Commercial Biomedical Test Module-3, designed to determine if administering an experimental agent preflight reduces the loss of bone associated with spaceflight [22]; multiple investigators shared materials collected post flight [23–27]. For the parent study, mice (“flight mice”) were flown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-135, for approximately 13 days. For this immune-specific sub-study, approximately ½ spleen from six C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, 9 weeks of age at start of flight) were made available immediately following spaceflight. The subjects were flown in a Space Shuttle Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which was housed in the mid-deck area of the vehicle for the duration of the spaceflight. Spleens from six ground-based control mice, which were handled and housed in a ground-based identical manner (AEM module) to the flight mice were included in the study. The AEM module housing conditions for control mice have been well described [28]. AEM ground control mice received vehicle control diluting agent. The mice were part of the NASA Ames Research Center’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (http://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts-135). Flight experiments were designed to investigate effects of microgravity on vascular atrophy in mouse hindlimbs. We are aware that among our six flight mouse subjects, four were treated with a bone-specific medication and two were untreated. For purposes of this article, analysis was conducted on all six flight subjects as a group, without knowledge of treatment, and data were compared to ground AEM control subjects. The individual mice that were drug or placebo treated remained unknown during experimentation; data presented here was not separated according to treatments. To our knowledge, there was no influence of medication on the data collected. Separate analysis of data did not indicate statistical outliers within the combined spaceflight mice, which would indicate affects due to treatment. In light of this, we believe our findings are relevant and important, even in light of inclusion of mice that received the bone loss experimental drug.Mouse Splenocytes Processing Animals were retrieved approximately 1 hour following deorbit, and sacrificed within 3–5 hours post flight, collected on July 21, 2011 at Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral, FL). Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguinations [28]. Half of the spleen was processed as previously described [28]. Briefly, the organ was homonenized between glass slides, RBC lysed with ACK buffer (Lonza), washed twice with 1x Cellgro Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Mediatech), and cultured in complete DMEM media [Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2.2g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.05g/L of HEPES (Sigma), 0.05g/L L-arginine (Sigma), 100 μg/mL penicillin G (Sigma), 50 μg/mL gentamycin sulfate (Sigma) 0.005% 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma)] at 1x106cells/mL. Processing of splenocytes for in vitro analysis occurred within 4 hours post flight. The animal welfare committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center was consulted prior to initiation of experimentation; no protocol was required as samples used were obtained post euthanasia. All NASA activities with these mice were performed according to guidelines stipulated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as described by the National Institutes of Health. Experiments were performed after approval by review boards associated with NASA’s standard operating procedures, and as reported for tissue used in recent reports [26, 28].Bead Uptake Assay Splenocytes were cultured with 1.0μm FluoSpheres polystyrene microsphere (Invitrogen) at ratio of 10 beads per 1 cell. At 2 hours, cells were washed with 1x PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes on ice, and stored in flow buffer (1% BSA in 1x PBS) for analysis.Stimulation Assays Isolated splenocytes were cultured for 24 hours in media alone or stimulated with 1) anti-CD3 (0.1μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (0.1μg/mL) antibodies (eBiosciences), 2) 2μg/mL Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma), 3) 200ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O111:B4, Sigma), 4) 10μg/mL Zymosan (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Invivogen), or 5) 100ng/mL flagellin (Salmonella typhimurium, Invivogen). At 24 hours, supernatants were collected for ELISA and cells collected for staining of surface markers.Flow Cytometry Identification of surface molecule expression by flow cytometric analysis was conducted as previously described [29]. Briefly, samples were blocked by incubating purified anti-CD16/32 (Fc block, BD Biosciences) on ice for 15 minutes. Then, samples were stained with mouse specific T-cell markers or DC markers antibody cocktails in staining buffer (1% BSA in 1xPBS) on ice for 45–60mins. T-cell marker cocktail: CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, CD28-PECy5, CD-25-PECy7, and CTLA-4-APC. DC marker cocktail: H2Kb-FITC, I-Ab-PE, CD86-PECy5, CD11c-PECy7, and CD80-APC. Stained samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 mins. Stained and fixed samples were stored in 500μL of staining buffer. Samples were read on Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Analysis was conducted with Cyflogic.Cytokine Analysis Supernatants were analyzed by DuoSet (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol as previously described [29–31]. Supernatants were analyzed for inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and lymphocyte cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ). Lower limits of detection for the assay were between 16–32 pg/mL.Statistics Splenocytes were collected from 6 mice per group. Flow analysis counted 20,000 events per sample. ELISA analysis was conducted in duplicate or triplicate. Data was analyzed by TwoWay ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. Significance is considered when p<0.05.Results Splenocyte Population Changes between Flight Mice and Ground Controls Basic differentiation of splenocyte cell populations between flight mice and matched ground controls were completed by flow cytometric analysis. Forward scatter (FS) and side scatter (SS) parameters were noted, with the former measuring size of particle and the latter measuring granularity. Cells were assessed immediately post 13 days in flight, or following short term culture in vitro. Distinct changes in total splenocyte population were noted. Native splenocytes collected from spleens immediate upon sacrifice demonstrated two distinct cell populations, based on FS. The flight mice splenocytes selectively demonstrated presence of a third population within gate 3 (G3) with higher FS compared to ground controls (Fig 1a). Fig 1b shows representative dot plots of cell population makeup within each gate identified in Fig 1a. There are clear population differences in cells expressing CD4, CD8, MHC I and MHC II (Fig 1b). Examination of T-cell and antigen presentation cell markers on the different cell populations found that G3 cells contained a higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells compared to G1 and G2 populations. The G3 population also had increased surface expression of MHC I compared to G1 and G2 cells (Fig 1c). This indicates that post-spaceflight mice have spleens with slightly higher CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations compared to matched ground controls. Fig 1.

(1b) Example of positive population composition of each gate identified in 1a from flight mice. (1c) Graph of percent positive and MFI from each marker of splenocytes from flight mice.Upon culture for 24 hours in cell media, relative marker expression for the splenocyte population shifted. Cultured splenocytes isolated from ground control mice exhibited an increase in cell density in G3 compared to cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice (Fig 2a). Examination revealed that G3 population has higher percentage of CD8+ and MHC I+ cells. It was also noted that G3 population also displayed increased surface expression of CD8+ as indicated by increased mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). Cell populations of G2 and G4 display surface marker expression typical of dendritic cells and macrophages (Fig 2b and 2c). These data suggests that in vitro culturing of splenocytes from ground control mice enhances relative abundance of CD8 T-cell marker expression compared to splenocytes collected from the mice post-spaceflight.

In addition to changes in overall T-cell and dendritic cell populations, markers important for T-cell activation and proliferation and dendritic cell antigen presentation were also examined (Tables 1 and 2).

Bold values represent significant differences and relative p values between groups. MFI; mean fluorescent intensity. N/A; not assessed.Analysis of cell populations indicated that the majority of lymphocytes resided within the G2 and G3 gated areas. As such, examination of changes in T-cell populations was restricted to G2 and G3 events. T-cell markers of interest examined are CD4, CD8, CD28 (the second signal for T-cell activation), CD25 (IL-2 receptor), and CTLA-4 (the signal for T-cell anergy). No differences were observed in percent of splenocytes expressing these surface markers between flight and ground control mice. However, several significant changes were observed in the intensity of surface marker expression. Splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in CD4 MFI, with a concurrent increase in CD8 MFI, compared to ground controls. The intensity of CD25 expression in both CD4 and CD8 cells were significantly decreased in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 1). Little to no CTLA-4 expression was detected from any of the samples (data not shown). Examination of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules were focused on events occurring in cells gated within G1, G2, and G3. There was a significant increase in population of splenocytes expressing the dendritic cell marker (CD11c) from flight mice compared to ground controls. A similar increase was also observed in dendritic cells (CD11c+) expressing MHC I. However, a significant decrease was detected in dendritic cells co-expressing MHC II from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls (Table 2).Post-Spaceflight Splenocytes Increased Ability to Uptake Particles A central process in innate immunity is the ability to phagocytose. To examine if post-spaceflight conditions affected the ability of splenocytes to uptake particles, splenocytes were incubated with fluorescent beads, and analyzed for bead ingestion conducted by flow cytometry. Three distinct populations for positive bead uptake were detected, and labeled as low, medium, high according to florescent intensity (FI). Cells from G1, G2, and G3 were considered as one population and distinguished only by FI. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in percent positive cells at low and medium FI, and a non-significant increase at high FI compared to ground controls (Fig 3). Fig 3. Bead uptake by splenocytes from flight mice and ground controls. Open in a new tab Splenocytes were incubate with fluorescent beads and collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Percent positive events were separated by peak mean florescent intensity and labeled as low, med, and high. Data was plotted for each individual mouse. Mean indicated by dotted line (ground AEM control) or solid line (flight mice). *** = p<0.001; **p = <0.01Changes in T-cell Surface Molecules upon Stimulation Next, changes in T-cells surface marker expression post stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and Concanavalin A (ConA) were examined. The total population of CD4+ cells was significantly decreased in splenocytes collected from flight mice in all cultured conditions (media control, CD3/28, or ConA) compared to ground controls. Additionally, stimulation of cultured cells also caused a downward trend of CD4 expressing cells compared to culturing in media control (Fig 4a). There was no significant difference in cell population expressing both CD4 and CD28 (Fig 4b). Stimulation with ConA dramatically increased the CD4+CD25+ population, with a significant decrease observed in splenocytes from flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 4c). A similar increase in CD4 cell population co-expressing CD28 and CD25 was observed during ConA stimulation. An unexpected finding was that CD4+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated and increase in CD28/25 co-expressing cells compared to ground controls (Fig 4d). Fig 4.

Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with only media (control), anti-CD3/CD28, or ConA.

For example, simple in vitro culturing of splenocytes in media alters intensity of CD8 expression. This was now examined in the post-flight group. After 24 hours in cell media, splenocytes, from both flight and ground controls, developed two distinct CD8+ cell populations based on mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). The populations were termed CD8lo+ and CD8hi+. Upon stimulation with ConA for 24 hours, this distinction disappears and most of the CD8+ splenocytes are CD8lo+ (Fig 5). Fig 5. Expression of CD8 on non-activated and ConA activated splenocytes. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with or without ConA (2μg/mL). Cells were collected and stained for expression of CD8. Representative flow dot graphs of CD8 positive populations after 24 hours culture in media only (left) or in the presence of ConA (right).Examination of CD8 expression during stimulation is divided between CD8lo and CD8hi populations. There is little if any change in CD8 expression among the media control and CD3/28 and Con A stimulated groups. However, CD8hi expression is very low after stimulation with ConA. No significant differences between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls in all culture conditions. The exception is the observation of a significant increase in CD25+CD28+ expression of CD8+ T-cells from splenocytes of flight mice compared to ground controls (Fig 6). Fig 6. Expression of surface markers of CD8lo and CD8hi splenocytes. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 hours with only media (control), anti-CD3/CD28, or ConA.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are well characterized pattern recognition receptors that initiate activation of the innate response. Using agonists for TLR-2 (Zymosan), TLR-4 (LPS), and TLR-5 (flagellin), splenocytes were stimulated for 24 hours and analyzed for surface expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Surface expression of MHC I from flight mice or ground controls demonstrated two distinct populations. One population exhibited low intensity of MHC I expression that is well confined to G3. The other population had a diverse intensity range of MHC I expression that was generally higher compared to those in G2 (Fig 7a). Analysis of MHC I allowed grouping into MHC Ilo (G3) and MHC Ihi (G2) populations. In percent population analysis of MHC I expression, no differences were observed for any of the TLR agonist conditions between splenocytes isolated from flight mice or ground controls. Interestingly, there was an across the board decrease of MHC I MFI from splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls in the G2 (MHC Ihi) population. This trend was completely reversed in the G3 (MHC Ilo) population in MHC I MFI, with splenocytes from flight mice demonstrating a significant increase in expression intensity compared to ground controls (Fig 7b). No differences were observed in expression of MHC II between flight mice and ground controls (data not shown). Fig 7. Antigen presentation molecule expression under TLR agonist stimulation. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without TLR agonists for 24 hours.

(7b) Percent positive and MFI of MHC I expression from G2 and G3 populations. *** = p<0.001.Expression of CD11c, a mouse dendritic cell marker, showed that splenocytes from flight mice had a global decrease in expression of CD11c positive cells under all culture conditions (Fig 8a). These dendritic cell populations were investigated for expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. CD11c+MCHI+ cells were decreased in both percent population and intensity of MHC I expression in all culture conditions in flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Fig 8b). CD11c+MHCII+ splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated increased in percent population and intensity of MHC II expression compared to ground controls (Fig 8c). There was little difference between flight mice and ground controls in CD11c+CD86+ splenocytes, except a significant decrease in CD11c+CD86+ cells under TLR-5 stimulation (Fig 8d). Finally, there was very low overall expression of CD80 (data not shown). Fig 8. Dendritic cell populations changes after TLR stimulation in post-spaceflight mice. Open in a new tab Flight (solid square) or ground AEM control (open circle) splenocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS with or without TLR agonists for 24 hours.

Cytokine production during stimulation is often used to determine cell activity. Supernatants from splenocytes stimulated with T-cell stimulants or TLR agonists were further examined for cytokine production by ELISA. Stimulation with ConA demonstrated a non-significant trend of increased IFN-γ production and a concurrent decrease in IL-2 production from flight mice splenocytes compared to ground controls (Table 3). TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists also stimulated an increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 from splenocytes isolated from flight mice versus ground controls. Only the increase in TNF-α induced by TLR-2 agonist represented a significant difference (Table 4). Little (below the level of detection of the assay) to no TNF-α and IL-6 were produced when stimulated with TLR-5 agonist (data not shown). Table 3.

Average values given with standard deviation.Discussion The immune dysfunction post-spaceflight is well documented. This disruption in immune activity is believed to be partly responsible for observed spaceflight and post-flight related incidence of immune-related adverse health events that may occur during spaceflight. With future plans for longer duration space travel, the question of how changes in host immunity would affect overall crew health needs to be addressed. The experiments conducted in this report focused on changes that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. This bridge is crucial to generating long-term memory protection against infection, and critical for mounting immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. Specifically, this report investigated the ability of dendritic cells (DC) to respond to stimulation through TLRs, and T-cell responsiveness through the T-cell receptor. To determine baseline receptor expression, the splenocytes were stained upon landing. These native expressions found no differences observed in the percent population changes of CD4 or CD8 T cells, with results reflecting similar findings from published works showing no changes in percent population of CD4 or CD8 T cells in rodents post-spaceflight [32–34]. Other reports show mixed changes. Specifically, some have identified increases in CD4 and CD8 populations [35–38], others show decreased CD4 and CD8 populations [39, 40], and others have shown a combination thereof [10] post-flight. Pecaut, et al. demonstrated that there was indeed a shift in leukocyte phenotypes to different organs, which may affect localization of response [41]. Likewise, conflicting reports are found from peripheral blood of astronauts post-flight [15, 16, 18, 20]. Some of these differences were attributed to the type of lymph organ examined, as thymus cells usually shows no change in CD4 and CD8 T cells populations while splenocytes do exhibit differences between flight animals and ground controls [36]. The seemingly contradictory evidence could be explained by different gating strategies used to determine percent positivity of events. The study presented here showed that splenocytes from mice post-flight demonstrated an increase in a cell population with high percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. While previous reports only examined percent positive populations, this study included examination of marker intensity, which was interpreted to indicate an increase in marker expression per cell. There was a significant decrease in the intensity of CD4 and an increase in intensity of CD8 expression on a per cell basis. Since CD4 and CD8 molecules play a role during T-cell recognition of antigen presentation by binding to the antigen presentation molecules, MHC I, MHC II, or CD1, any change in their surface expression could affect the avidity potential to alter T-cell stimulation. Indeed, the avidity/affinity model of peripheral T-cell regulation suggests that changes in CD4 and CD8 expression affect T-cell activation. CD8lo cells require higher avidity of T-cell receptor and MHC I interactions for activation [42] and control/suppress other CD8 T-cell responsiveness to antigen [43]. This study also found splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in intensity of CD25 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells compared to ground controls. CD25 is the IL-2 receptor, which is often used as a marker to denote regulatory T-cells. However, this decrease in CD25 intensity is not interpreted to indicate a change in regulatory T-cell post-flight, especially because the population of CD25+ splenocytes did not change. The CD25 ligand, IL-2, is the T-cell proliferating factor. Experiments on the Jurkat T cell line post-flight demonstrated a lack of proliferation and elevations of Fas/APO-1, suggesting spaceflight conditions induced apoptosis in T-cells [44, 45]. The decrease in CD25 expression on a per cell basis suggests that flight splenocytes downregulate factors for proliferation. And it has been clearly demonstrated that immediate early genes of lymphocytes are affected under conditions of microgravity [46]. Dendritic cells are the primary antigen presenting cells to bridge innate and adaptive immunity. DCs respond to invading pathogens, prime and activate antigen specific T-cells, and promote development of antigen specific memory. In the mouse, expression of CD11c, a β2 integrin, is a marker for DC identification. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in CD11c+ population compared to ground controls, suggesting an enhancement of the DC population. This is the first reported change of spaceflight on DC population dynamics. Interestingly, previous published reports examining another β2 integrin, CD11b, showed a decrease population change, interpreted as a decrease in monocytes/macrophages [40], which was also observed using CD14/16 markers for identification [10]. As with T-cells, spaceflight conditions were also reported to increased monocyte/macrophage population [15, 16]. Similar to T-cell subsets, macrophages and dendritic cells populations have differential proliferation results in response to spaceflight. Examination of MHC I and II presentation molecule expression found that CD11c+ splenocytes post-flight had a significant increase in MHC I+ and a significant decrease in MHC II+ populations compared to ground controls. There are limited reports on antigen presentation molecule expression, and both published articles also found a decrease in class II presentation molecules expressing populations [47, 48]. These results confirm that spaceflight alters class II presentation molecule expression, which may indicate a diminution in the potential to effectively present antigens to CD4+ T-cells. Splenocytes post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase in bead uptake compared to ground controls. This is the first report that flight conditions influence particle uptake. The implications suggest that spaceflight does not hinder particle uptake, and may even enhance the function. However, it is not clear how alteration of particulate uptake would affect host immune status. Limited hindlimb suspension model studies may shed light on this, if one takes the assumption that uptake of pathogenic organisms are similar to that of beads. In those studies, in vivo infection found no change in clearance of rotavirus [49] and a decrease in bacterial clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [50] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [51]. This suggests that other immune effects resulting from spaceflight contribute to clearance dysfunction, even if there are increased uptake events of particulates. Overall, this is difficult to assess, and we realize that beads travel along different phagocytic pathways than the agents mentioned. Development of effective immunity towards pathogens relies on responding to innate signals. The toll-like receptors (TLR) are well established pattern recognition receptors stimulated by pathogenic motifs [52]. The most commonly used TLR ligand to investigate spaceflight effect on cell function is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In humans, blood cells isolated during spaceflight responded to LPS by increasing production of IL-8, however, this finding resolved upon post-spaceflight examination [18]. LPS has also shown to promote lower production of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 and increased IL-1β post-spaceflight in humans [47]. Reports in mice show a mixed response when looking a whole splenocyte populations [53]. Purified macrophages flow in space demonstrated an increase in both IL-1 and TNF-α production in response to LPS [54]. While that report did not observe a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation, the flight splenocytes did exhibit a trend of increase in TNF-α and IL-6 production compared to ground controls. The data presented here extended observations to include cytokine production with the TLR-2/6 and TLR-5 ligands, zymosan (fungal) and flagellin (bacterial) respectively. Zymosan stimulated a significant increase in TNF-α; no cytokine changes were observed upon flagellin stimulation. Chapes et al. investigated stimulation with poly I:C, a TLR-3 ligand, and found an increase in IFN-α [54]. For the most part, flight exposure did not have a deleterious effect on TLR activation and stimulation, suggesting that the innate immune inflammatory response remains intact. Few published articles have examined changes in surface expression of presentation and co-stimulatory molecules after TLR stimulation. While cytokine production is an important indicator of immune response, the main effect of how DCs response to TLR stimulation is to increase antigen presentation and stimulate T-cells [55]. Splenocytes demonstrated similar changes DC surface molecule expression post flight, regardless of TLR stimulation. For example, the DC population from the flight mice had altered MHC I and MHC II expressing populations compared to ground controls, even in cultures that did not receive TLR-agonist stimulation. Regarding adaptive immune functions, T-cells are critical for control of re-infection and re-activation events. Unlike DCs, the effect post-spaceflight on T-cell activity has been well documented. Stimulating with anti-CD3/CD28, which simulates T-cell activation by antigen presenting cells, resulted in increased IFN-γ and decreased IL-2 [18, 56]. ConA stimulation, which stimulates T-cells through the T-cell receptor without requiring the secondary signal (CD28), resulted in no change or increased IL-2 [36, 57], increased IL-3, and decreased IFN-γ [58]. Use of other mitogens, such as PHA or PMA/Ionomycin, that stimulates by bypassing both the T-cell and co-stimulatory receptors, led to no change or decreased IL-2 [10, 57], decreased IFN-γ [10] and decreased TNF-α [18]. The data in this report reflects some differences in reported observations, although in line with that reported by Gridley, et al. [59]. Rather, the results reported here for ConA stimulation demonstrated a non-significant increase in IFN-γ and decreased IL-2. The discrepancy in cytokine results could be differences in cell culture number, concentration of stimulants, and time of stimulation. Surface molecule expression was examined in stimulated T-cells. Little or no differences were observed in the flight mice versus ground controls, with two notable exceptions. Regardless of stimulation parameters, the cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice were significantly depressed in their expression of CD4. Second, while expression of CD8 intensity immediately post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase on a per cell basis, further in vitro culture of cells distinctively identified two sets of CD8 cells, CD8lo and CD8hi. This distinction disappeared upon ConA stimulation. Indeed, the flight mice splenocytes evidenced a significant increase in CD4 or CD8 T-cells that also expressed CD25 or CD25/28. Therefore, it is important for future studies to define gating strategies, as we have done here. We suggest that CD25, along with CD69, are used as markers of early T-cell activation. Short-term spaceflight increased expression of CD25/69 when stimulated with anti-CD3/28 [20]. The results with ConA may indicate that flight mice could demonstrate increased early T-cell activation upon stimulation, compared to ground controls. Our report focused on phenotypic alterations that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses crucial for generating protective immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. It would indeed be important to understand how long the phenotypic changes were sustained post flight; analysis of genetic alterations or changes in methylation status would certainly be warranted. The condition of the spaceflight environment has been shown to alter cytosine methylation patterns to generate heritable epigenetic changes in rice. Both hypo- and hypermethylation events can occur, with concurrent dysregulation of gene expression. Genes for DNA methyltransferases were very sensitive to spaceflight conditions [60, 61]. Similar effects were identified in microgravity studies in human lymphocytes [62, 63], where both DNA methylation genes, as well as histone acetylation genes, were affected. In addition, DNA repair mechanisms were also diminished. Overall this suggests both an accumulation of damaged DNA as well as the potential for inheritable and sustainable changes in cellular phenotypic activity. In conclusion, there exists a large body of evidence that spaceflight does impact T-cell activity and cause global suppression in response to multiple stimulants. Indeed, these “type IV hypersensitive” class responses have been found to be reduced to a variety of antigens during and post spaceflight [14, 64]. The data from this study shed additional light towards molecular mechanisms involved in immune changes induced by spaceflight that could alter activation of innate and adaptive immunity, at least post flight. It remains to be determined if these changes may also impact responses during active flight. Given the limited number of subjects for spaceflight studies, future analysis should continue to examine both innate (DC) and adaptive (T-cell) responses.Supporting Information S1 File(PPTX) Click here for additional data file.

Keywords: particle radiation, total-body irradiation, hematopoiesis, mouse model, spaceflightINTRODUCTION The impact of radiation on astronaut health, especially during extended deep-space missions, continues to be a significant concern to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Since current guidelines of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) apply only to low Earth orbit (LEO) missions [1], the need for data on radiation effects beyond LEO is increasing as space exploration proceeds. Exposure to relatively high doses and various forms of radiation during spaceflight beyond LEO is inevitable. Sources include galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which originates from outside our solar system, and solar particle events (SPEs), which appear sporadically and are unpredictable [2]. During extended deep-space missions to Mars and elsewhere, crew members could receive relatively high doses of radiation [3–5]. The great majority of cosmic radiation is composed of protons (86%) and helium ions (11%). High-charge and high-energy (HZE) ions represent a very small percentage of the various forms of space radiation, i.e. ~1%. Of these, 56Fe is considered to be the most important because of its high linear energy transfer (LET). Although many body systems could be adversely affected, the immune system is especially radiosensitive. Immune depression and/or dysfunction could lead to overwhelming infection and other pathologies, which could increase the risk of mission failure and possibly decrease quality of life after return to Earth. Potential immunological aberrations associated with radiation and other stressors in the spaceflight environment (e.g. alterations in gravitational force, hypoxia and psychological stress of confinement) have been summarized relatively recently [6]. Many studies have found immune aberrations in astronauts, cosmonauts and rodents on various space missions [7–17]. In addition, ground-based studies that simulate space radiation and other stressors have shown significant changes in immune parameters compared with controls [18–28]. The great majority of the space radiation-associated studies have used photons (γ-rays, X-rays) and to a lesser extent also protons. Overall, there is much less knowledge regarding immune effects after exposure to HZE ions. This is important to note because different forms of radiation do not always result in identical outcomes [20, 29–31]. Although progress certainly has been made in understanding the direct and indirect health risks associated with high-charge/high-energy particle radiation during space exploration, the immunological responses are complex and many questions still remain [32]. The current study was one of a series done with 56Fe radiation in murine models in order to confirm and extend our previous findings. In those studies, we found drastic reductions in virtually all characterized immune parameters, with associated changes in ex vivo function, four days post-irradiation [33–36]. While most of the population recovered by Day 110–113 [30, 36], there were still some strain-dependent changes in T and B cell populations 30 days post-exposure [34]. Those findings are extensively compared with the present data in the discussion. The major goal here was to determine the effect of whole-body 56Fe26+ irradiation on leukocyte distribution and function at a relatively long time-point after exposure.MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and total-body irradiation The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Loma Linda University (LLU) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) approved this study. The animals were in the BNL-7 run of the NASA radiation health experimental series. C57BL/6 J female mice (n = 60) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA, and shipped directly to BNL at 8–9 weeks of age. After an acclimatization period of ~1 week, non-anesthetized animals were placed individually into well-aerated polystyrene boxes (volume 3 × 3 × 6 cm) and were exposed to iron ions (56Fe, Z = 26, 1 GeV/nucleon, LET = 148.2 keV/μm track average) using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). Additional beam characteristics can be found elsewhere [37, 38]. The radiation was delivered in a single fraction to total doses of 1, 2 and 3 Gy at a dose rate of ~1 Gy/min at beam entry. A 0 Gy control group was treated in an identical manner but without irradiation. Several days later the animals were shipped to LLU. On Day 40 after irradiation, the mice were weighed and then rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 Specimen collection and processing Spleen, thymus, liver and right lung were collected and weighed immediately after euthanasia. Organ mass was normalized relative to body mass using the following formula: Norm. mass = organ mass (mg)/body mass (g). Additional procedures were carried out as previously described [17, 33, 35]. Briefly, blood was collected in syringes containing potassium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2-EDTA; Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) via cardiac puncture. Spleens were placed into 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, USA) that included 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, processed into single-celled suspensions using autoclaved wooden applicator sticks, and then erythrocytes were lysed using a standard procedures. Bone marrow was flushed from the right femur using 1 ml of complete RPMI-1640 medium.Automated hematological analysis of blood and spleen cells Whole blood and splenocyte samples (12 μl) were evaluated using an ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI, USA). For the blood, this included a white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte counts and percentages, red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) counts, hemoglobin (HGB) concentration, hematocrit (HCT; percentage of whole blood composed of RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV; mean volume per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; mean weight of hemoglobin per RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC; mean concentration of hemoglobin per RBC), RBC distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV). For the spleen, WBC counts and the numbers and percentages of the three major leukocyte populations were obtained.Spontaneous and mitogen-induced blastogenesis To determine spontaneous blastogenesis of cells in blood and spleen, aliquots were diluted with complete RPMI 1640 medium and dispensed into wells of microculture plates. Immediately thereafter, 1 μCi of 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR), specific activity = 46 Ci/mmol (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) was added, and the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Counts per minute (cpm) for both blood and spleen were normalized to cell count. The response of spleen cells to three different mitogens, i.e. phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA), was also determined. After adjusting to 2 × 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were dispensed into microtiter plate wells, with and without each of the three mitogens (pre-titrated for maximal response), at 2 × 105 splenic leukocytes/0.2 ml/well and incubated for 48 h. During the last 4 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with 3H-TdR at 1 μCi/50 μl/well. The cpms in response to the mitogens were converted to a stimulation index (SI): SI = (cpm with mitogen – cpm without mitogen)/cpm without mitogen. In both types of assays described above, samples from each mouse were tested in triplicate. The cpm was obtained using a liquid beta-scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Additional details for these procedures have been previously described [39, 40].Flow cytometry analysis of leukocyte subpopulations Leukocytes were evaluated for expression of surface markers using fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), a direct-staining procedure and a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The mAbs were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP). For all mAb combinations characterized in the spleen and blood, leukocytes were identified using antibody against cluster differentiation (CD) molecule CD45; lymphocytes/mononuclear cells were distinguished from granulocytes based on CD45 versus side scatter gating. For lymphocytes, percentages (%) were defined as a percent of the total mononuclear cell (MNC) count as defined by the standard CD45 vs Side Scatter MNC gate. Similarly, for CD11b+ granulocytes, percentages were defined as percent of cell counts within the granulocyte gate. Numerical values for leukocyte subsets were calculated using the cell counts obtained with the automated hemocytometer (described above). In the blood and spleen, T helper (Th) lymphocytes were determined using mAbs against CD3/CD4, whereas mAbs against CD3/CD8 were used to identify T cytotoxic (Tc) cells. In the spleen, CD11b+ granulocytes with and without adhesion makers CD54 and CD62E were identified. Similar procedures were also performed on mononuclear bone marrow cells to determine the percentage with stem cell markers, i.e. CD34 and stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1). In all cases, a minimum of 5000 events were analyzed per sample using CellQuestTM software version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson).Statistical analysis One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using radiation dose as the independent variable. Tukey's pairwise multiple comparison test was used in post-hoc analysis when indicated. The program used was SigmaPlot for Windows version 13.0 (Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and a P value of < 0.05 was considered significant; P < 0.1 indicated a trend toward significance.RESULTS Body and organ masses Figure 1 shows results for body and thymus masses. There were significant differences in thymus mass alone or when normalized to body mass. The thymus values were consistently higher in the irradiated groups compared with the 0 Gy group (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005), although Tukey's test showed a P < 0.05 only for the 2 Gy group versus the 0 Gy group. There were no significant differences between groups in spleen, liver or lung masses, although one-way ANOVA indicated trends for a radiation dose effect (P < 0.1) on spleen mass relative to body mass and lung mass alone (Table 1).

Tukey's test revealed that WBC counts in the 1 Gy group were higher versus the 0 Gy group and that there was a strong trend for high counts in the 2 Gy group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.06, respectively). This was likely due to the high numbers of lymphocytes in the 1 and 2 Gy groups (P < 0.05). A similar pattern was noted for monocyte/macrophage and granulocyte counts, but there was no statistical support. Percentages of these three major leukocyte types were equivalent to control values regardless of radiation (Fig. 3). Fig. 3.

A post-hoc Tukey's test showed that there were higher cpm in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In the spleen, however, there were no significant differences or trends between the various groups. This was true for the spleen also with respect to the SI values obtained after mitogen-induced blastogenesis (lower panels of Fig. 4). Although there were steady dose-dependent decreases in PHA- and Con A-induced blastogenesis, this did not reach the level of significance. Fig. 4.

One-way ANOVA, however, did indicate a trend (P < 0.1) for a radiation-induced decrease in T cell counts and percentages and an increase in B cell percentage; Tukey's test for %B cells revealed a trend for 3 Gy vs the 0 Gy group (P < 0.07).

Counts and percentages of CD4+ Th cells were equivalent to normal. However, radiation had a highly significant effect on CD8+ Tc cell counts and percentages (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.001). As far as Tc cell counts, the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups were lower compared with 0 Gy (P < 0.05). Tc cell percentages were significantly lower in all irradiated groups compared with the 0 Gy group (P < 0.05). This led to a significantly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio compared with the 0 Gy group for all three irradiated groups (P < 0.05). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab T cell subsets in blood.

Based on the one-way ANOVA, there was no radiation effect on T cell counts and only a trend was noted for %T cells (P < 0.1), with the 3 Gy group having a slightly lower percentage than the 0 Gy group (P < 0.08). In contrast, there were significant radiation effects on B cell counts (P < 0.005) and percentages (P < 0.05). The B cell numbers were higher in the 1 Gy and 2 Gy groups versus the 0 Gy group (P < 0.05), and there was a trend for a high count in the 3 Gy group (P < 0.08). As far as %B cells, only the 3 Gy group had a higher percentage compared with the 0 Gy group (P < 0.05). NK cell counts were equivalent to normal, and there was only a trend for low percentages in the irradiated groups (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.1; Tukey's test: P < 0.08 for 3 Gy vs 0 Gy). Fig. 7.

Post-hoc Tukey's: (a) P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy, (b) P < 0.08 vs 0 Gy.The results for T cell subsets are shown in Fig. 8. The CD4+ Th cell counts were significantly affected (P < 0.005). Tukey's test indicated that the Th cell number was higher in the 2 Gy group (P < 0.05), and there was a trend for an increase in the 1 Gy group compared with the 0 Gy group. Th cell percentages, however, were equivalent to normal throughout. In contrast to Th cells, the CD8+ Tc cell counts were affected by radiation dose (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between irradiated groups and 0 Gy controls. There was, however, a highly significant radiation effect on Tc cell percentages (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.001); low proportions were present in all irradiated groups compared with the 0 Gy group (P < 0.05). These findings resulted in an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab T cell subsets in spleen. Data were obtained using flow cytometry.

Although the numbers of granulocytes expressing CD11b were similar in all groups, one-way ANOVA indicated a significant radiation dose effect on percentages (P < 0.05), most likely due to relatively high values in the 1 Gy group. Tukey's test, however, showed only trends for %CD11b: 0 Gy vs 1 Gy (P < 0.09). When the CD11b+ cells were double-labeled with adhesion markers, i.e. either CD54 or CD62E, there were no significant differences or trends in numbers or percentages between the various groups. Note that mononuclear cells were also tested for the same adhesion markers, but there were no significant differences between or trends among groups (data not shown). Fig. 9.

However, significance was obtained for Sca-1 (P < 0.05); Tukey's test showed that the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups had lower values compared with the 0 Gy group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.08, respectively). A significant radiation effect was also present for CD34/Sca-1 cells (P < 0.005). The values for these double-positive cells in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups were significantly lower than for the 0 Gy controls (P < 0.05). Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Stem cell markers in bone marrow.

In our study, there was no effect of 56Fe radiation on body mass at the 40-day post-exposure time-point. This is consistent with our previous studies in same strain mice that showed no effect on body mass on Days 4 and 113 after 56Fe irradiation using doses of up to 3 Gy [35, 36]. In other studies using 56Fe, we have found that body mass is dependent on a number of variables such as radiation dose, mouse strain and time of assessment [41]. In a rat model followed for 9 months after exposure to 1–4 Gy 56Fe radiation, body mass was generally lower compared with controls [42, 43]. When evaluating several different organ masses alone and in relation to body mass in our study, only the thymus was significantly affected, i.e. consistently higher mass alone or in relation to body mass in the irradiated groups. The thymus is the primary site for T cell maturation and plays an important role in the induction of tolerance to self-antigens. Although this organ is most important early in life, it can participate in T cell regeneration under dire circumstances in adults, thus resulting in increased thymic mass [44, 45]. In a previous study using similar doses of 56Fe radiation, we found that thymus and spleen (but not body, liver or lung) masses were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner on Day 4 [35]. The complete blood count (CBC) analysis of blood showed no significant radiation effect on WBC count or on the counts or percentages of the three major leukocyte types (lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes). There was, however, a strong trend for low monocyte numbers in the 3 Gy group. This was somewhat surprising since monocytes, i.e. important members of the innate immune system, have long been known to be more radioresistant than lymphocytes and granulocytes [46]. A possible reason is that the monocytes may have migrated out of the blood circulation and become localized at a site of injury/inflammation. In a previous study, we found 56Fe dose-dependent decreases in blood WBCs and in all three major leukocyte types on Day 4 post-irradiation, followed by complete recovery in cell numbers by Day 113; monocyte–macrophage percentages, however, were significantly decreased in both blood and spleen [36]. Others have also noted great reduction in WBCs and the three major leukocyte types in mice during 4, 7 and 14 days after 3 Gy 56Fe irradiation [47]. This latter study also demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of androstenediol 30 min after exposure could significantly mitigate the detrimental effect. The blood data also showed low RBC counts, HGB and HCT in the 3 Gy group, thereby indicating the possibility of anemia. Since hematopoietic stem cells are precursors to RBCs (as well as WBCs), our bone marrow data showing low levels of cells with hematopoietic stem cell markers are consistent with these findings. Significant depression in all three of these parameters has also been noted on Day 4 after iron ion irradiation, with return to normal by Day 113 [35, 36]. In a comparison of 2 Gy iron, carbon and proton radiation, the 56Fe-irradiated group had the lowest RBC count, HGB and HCT at 110 days post-exposure, although statistical significance was not always obtained [30]. Loss in RBC mass, due at least partly to destruction of newly released RBCs, and anemia have been consistently associated with space missions for many years [48–50]. As recently reviewed, the underlying mechanisms appear to be at least partly linked to neocytolysis under microgravity [51]. Based on these and other reports, the addition of particle radiation exposure, especially during extended deep-space missions, could further exacerbate anemia in astronauts. Overall, we found that the radiation effect was much greater in the spleen than in blood. Although statistical support was not always obtained, the consistently high numbers of WBCs and of the major leukocyte types (especially lymphocytes) in spleens of the irradiated mice further supports the premise that hematopoiesis was still continuing above a normal level. Data on lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood showed only a trend for a radiation effect on T cells (number and percentage) and B cells (percentage). Further analysis showed significant radiation-induced decreases in CD8+ Tc cell counts and percentages, but no differences among groups in the CD4+ Th cells. These findings led to a greatly increased CD4:CD8 ratio. A very similar pattern was also observed in the spleen, except that there was a radiation-associated increase in B cells, thereby suggesting a continuing need to regenerate these antibody-producing lymphocytes. Our findings are consistent with previous reports on variations in the radiosensitivity of the major T cell subsets (CD8 > CD4) using γ-rays [52–54], protons [55] and 56Fe [36]. Some radiation-associated differences in lymphocyte subpopulation response may be at least partly dependent on the rodent model used [34, 42]. Since CD8+ Tc lymphocytes kill cells that are virally infected or transformed to a potentially malignant phenotype, low numbers certainly could compromise immune resistance during space missions. In addition, recent reports indicate that upon activation these cells differentiate into subpopulations (e.g. Tc2, Tc9, Tc17, CD8+ Treg cells) that, when not controlled properly, could lead to immunopathologies such as allergies and autoimmune diseases [56–58]. Although hematopoiesis appeared to be upregulated in both the spleen and thymus, analysis of bone marrow consistently showed a low percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers (CD34, Sca-1). CD34 is expressed on early progenitor cells involved in hematopoiesis, but has also been reported to be present on highly functional endothelial cell progenitors [59] and as an important facilitator of cell migration [60]. Sca-1 is a very common marker used to identify hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow, but is also expressed on some cells in a variety of tissues that may serve as tissue-resident stem and progenitor cells [61]. There is very little information regarding the impact of 56Fe on hematopoiesis. A mouse study that included lethal doses found that 56Fe radiation caused accelerated and more severe hematopoietic toxicity compared with γ-rays and protons [29]. Interestingly, this latter study also found that 56Fe had selective enhanced toxicity to bone marrow progenitor and stem cells because intestinal crypt cells did not show increased toxicity related to 56Fe exposure. Based on a study of bone marrow cell phenotypes in mice shortly after a 13-day mission in space, the results suggested that the spaceflight mice had more differentiated cells within the very large and granular population compared with ground controls [16] More research is obviously needed on the status of hematopoiesis and tissue regeneration in various body compartments under spaceflight conditions. Spontaneous blastogenesis for cells in the blood was consistently higher in the irradiated groups, with statistical significance obtained for 2 Gy and 3 Gy versus 0 Gy. This indicates ongoing DNA synthesis in cells entering the blood circulation from the bone marrow. In the spleen, however, spontaneous blastogenesis was equivalent to normal, regardless of radiation, thereby suggesting no great need for leukocyte regeneration at the 40-day post-irradiation time-point. We have previously found that enhanced spontaneous blastogenesis after whole-body 56Fe irradiation is more pronounced within a few days after exposure [33, 41]. Since measuring lymphocyte response to mitogens is a common and effective way of screening for cellular immunodeficiency [62], three different mitogens were selected for the recent study. PHA, a lectin found in plants, is a classical activator of T cell proliferation, regardless of antigen specificity. ConA, another plant lectin, stimulates T cell subsets that include precursors to suppressor T cells [63]. LPS, a B cell activator, is a molecule found on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. In the irradiated groups, spleen cell ability to respond to the T cell mitogens PHA and ConA was relatively low and response to LPS was slightly elevated, but statistical support for any SI differences versus 0 Gy was lacking. In a previous study, we found significant depression in response to PHA and ConA, but not LPS, on Day 4 after exposure to either 2 Gy or 3 Gy 56Fe [33]. Based on these and other studies [41], it appears that 56Fe radiation in the spaceflight environment may have no long-term effect on mitogen-induced responsiveness. However, abnormalities in these types of responses due to spaceflight conditions have been reported. For example, in vitro activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes has been reported to be severely depressed during spaceflight [64]. Also, a recent study using ConA and several toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists found aberrations in the response of mouse splenocytes after return from the STS-135 mission in space [14]. Concern regarding immune dysfunction that leads to increased risk for infections, especially during extended missions, remains high. Expression of adhesion markers by granulocytes is important in leukocyte communication and migration to sites of damage. Neutrophils, by far the most abundant granulocyte, have a very short half-life in the blood circulation. In the spleen, however, there are marginated or slowly transiting pools of these cells within the vascular compartment [65]. In the current study, radiation-associated trends were noted in the percentage of CD11b+ single-label granulocytes in the spleen (slight increase in the 1 Gy group and slight decreases in the 2 Gy and 3 Gy groups vs 0 Gy). CD11b is a trans-membrane protein (also known as Mac-1 and CR3) that binds to complement fragment C3bi. CD11b, as well as other adhesion molecules, are expressed not only by granulocytes but also by monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells and some lymphocyte populations [66, 67]. There was no radiation effect when CD11b+ cells were double-labeled with CD54, which is the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) that binds to leukocyte function antigen-1, or when double-labeled with CD62E, which is involved in trans-endothelial cell migration. In a previous 56Fe study, we found the main effects of dose on CD11b+ and CD54+ cell proportions in the spleen, but the effect was greatest on Day 4 [41]. Nonetheless, more 56Fe research in this area should be done. The impact of spaceflight on adhesion markers has been previously noted. We found changes in genes encoding adhesion molecules and the extracellular matrix in lungs of mice shortly after return from a 13-day mission in space, i.e. STS-118 [68]. In a study of astronauts that assessed soluble adhesion markers 10 days prelaunch, immediately after landing and 2–4 days after flight found dilution of soluble iCAM-1 and E-selectin; soluble P-selectin was affected by flight duration [69]. In another study of astronauts who flew aboard 10 different shuttle flights found changes in a number of adhesion markers, e.g. CD11a, CD54, soluble ICAM-1 and soluble E-selectin [70]. The data in this latter study suggested that spaceflight could result in reduced leukocyte–endothelial adhesion. In conclusion, our data show aberrations in a variety of immune parameters at 40 days after whole-body 56Fe irradiation. Implications regarding immune defense status and long-term effects remain to be determined. More research is definitely needed on samples obtained during spaceflight as well as from ground-based studies that include multiple forms of radiation to more closely mimic exposure during flight. A better understanding of the complex actions and interactions of stressors in the spaceflight environment will increase the chance for effective countermeasure development.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank Gregory A.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The final US Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, launched on July 8, 2011. After 12 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes, Space Shuttle Atlantis landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. One of the many experiments flown on this historic flight to the International Space Station (ISS) was BioServe Space Technology’s Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3). Sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the last animal flight of the shuttle era was intended to test the impact of their proprietary pharmaceutical agent on spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal atrophy. Participants in the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) were given the opportunity to analyze a subset of the placebo-treated mice (n = 5–10, depending on the assay and tissue) as long as it did not interfere with the primary science. Our research team at Loma Linda University (LLU) has participated in all three Amgen/CBTM flights (STS-108, -118, and -135) [1–6], giving us the unique opportunity to both repeat and expand on previous results. There are at least three, currently unavoidable components of the spaceflight environment that directly impact immune function. These include changes in the inertial environment (e.g. launch and landing loads, microgravity), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (e.g. solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays, and the Van Allen belts), and physiological/psychological stress (e.g. unloading, work-related stress). Ground-based studies have shown that each of these environmental factors alone can have an impact on immune function. Previously, we and others have shown that the spaceflight environment can have a dramatic influence on immunity. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight [2, 4]. Studies in both animal models and humans have shown that the spaceflight environment can influence total body, thymus and spleen mass [7–18], lymphocyte population distributions [18–25] and circulating corticosterone levels [16, 17, 26–33]. Interestingly, spaceflight is also known to alter energy/lipid metabolism [34, 35] and ground-based studies suggest that the stress marker, corticosterone/cortisol, plays a significant role [36]. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissues to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis [36]. As we demonstrate, metabolomic analysis of the liver indicates that glycerol was more abundant in flight mice relative to ground controls. Furthermore, data from the liver, skin and adrenal gland suggest that spaceflight caused a significant increase in corticosterone levels system-wide. These seemingly unrelated lines of investigation are important because there is a growing body of work describing the interaction between innate immunity and lipid metabolism (S1 Fig). Chronic inflammation is now accepted as a critical component in many pathologies and chronic diseases. Macrophages are not only among the first responders in host resistance to infection, but also have an underappreciated role in host health when metabolic changes occur [37]. For example, in obese people, increased numbers of liver and adipose tissue macrophages correlate with the development of metabolic syndrome [38]. In the current study we describe a more systemic response to microgravity by combining traditional measures of innate immune function (population distributions, oxidative burst capacity, phagocytosis) and stress responses (adrenal catecholamine and corticosterone levels) with ‘omics techniques (metabolomics and transcriptomics). We believe that, for the first time, we can begin to show the links between spaceflight-dependent immune dysfunction and changes in metabolism.",
    "methods": "Methods Mice and treatment On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched, 11 week old, female C57BL/6J mice (n = 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for ~13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC: Ground AEM controls (n = 10) and Vivarium controls (n = 8). Due to the nature of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP), we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Sample sizes for individual assays are indicated where appropriate. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice, housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow, were used to normalize cell counts, thus minimizing day-to-day variability. Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3–5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Samples were shipped to either LLU or University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and stored appropriately prior to use. These studies were approved by the NASA Ames and University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). Tissue handling Each spleen was cut in half at the time of dissection, placed into complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640) medium with 20% bovine calf serum and shipped on ice via overnight courier to LLU for further processing. Note: There was a problem with the courier shipping fresh tissues from the ground control mice from KSC to LLU. As a result, “fresh” ground control splenocyte samples were processed and assayed at LLU 48 hours after tissue collection. In contrast, “fresh” flight samples were processed and assayed roughly 24 hours post-tissue collection. This must be considered in interpreting all assays involving “fresh” splenocytes presented below. Only the assays that involved fresh splenic tissue were affected by this shipping error. These include flow cytometry, oxidative burst, background ROS, and phagocytosis assays. Adrenals were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of dissection and stored at -80°C until analysis. Liver lobes were extracted and dissected at the time of dissection. A portion of the sample was prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde. The rest of the liver was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis. Note: none of the liver or adrenal tissues were impacted by the shipping error. Splenocyte viability Spleen cell concentration was adjusted to 2 x 106 cells/ml and mixed with 0.4% trypan blue solution. The cell suspension was loaded onto CHT4 counting chamber slides and viability was assessed via the Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelcom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA). Splenic leukocyte quantification Splenocyte single-cell suspensions were diluted in RPMI-1640 medium and evaluated using the ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI) after lysis of erythrocytes by incubation in 2 ml of ammonium-chloride-potassium solution for 4 min at 4°C. Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets was performed on spleen using a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA). Monoclonal antibodies (MAb; BD Pharmingen, Inc., San Diego, CA) were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP). MAb were directed against the following markers: CD3 (G4.18)–mature T cells; CD4 (OX-35)–T helper (Th) cells; CD8 (OX-8)–T cytotoxic (Tc) cells; CD45 (OX-1)–leukocytes; CD45R (HIS24)–B cells. We gated on the mononuclear population on a CD45 vs side scatter dot plot. At least 5,000 gated events/tube were evaluated using CellQuestTM software version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson). All cell count numbers were normalized to Vivarium controls and combined for the final analysis using the following equation: Final Data Point = [Measured Data Point] / [Average of Daily Vivarium Control] * [Average of All Controls for All Experiments]. Splenocyte oxidative burst and background reactive oxygen species (ROS)–plate reader Spleen white blood cells (WBCs) were treated with zymosan A (for burst activity; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or medium (for background activity), and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a membrane-permeable diacetate derivative of DCFH. Upon entering cells the diacetate is cleaved enzymatically. Both the DCFH-DA and DCFH are non-fluorescent fluorescein analogues. They are oxidized to highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by H2O2 and hydroperoxides. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorometer at 485 nm excitation and 530 emission. Splenocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis–flow cytometry Fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Trade name Pansorbin, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was stained with propidium iodide (PI) and used to quantify phagocytosis. DCFH-DA was used to quantify oxidative burst. Spleen cells were transferred into 5 ml tubes. DCFH-DA and PI-labeled S. aureus were added to the cells and allowed to incubate. Fluorescence was detected using a 4-color FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer. Analysis of 5,000 events/tube was performed using CellQuestTM software (v3.1). Adrenal tissue homogenate One adrenal gland from each mouse was weighed and homogenized using a Powergen homogenizer (Fischer Scientific, Tustin, CA) with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the other adrenal was homogenized with 500 μl of 0.1M HClO4. The samples were spun at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aliquotted and frozen at -80°C until assayed. The supernatants were used to assess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. Samples homogenized in HClO4 were used to assess corticosterone, protein, and catecholamines. Total protein concentration in adrenals Total protein concentration was quantified in the adrenals using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA). Samples were run with protein standards ranging from 500 μg/ml to 7.8 μg/ml diluted with 0.1M HClO4. Corticosterone via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The adrenal glands from each mouse were homogenized. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Aliquots of frozen adrenal tissue supernatant were thawed, diluted 1:10 in assay buffer, and corticosterone was measured using an ELISA kit for mouse corticosterone from AssayPro (St. Charles, MO), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Plates containing duplicate samples and standards were read on a microplate reader set at 450 nm. Corticosterone levels in adrenal supernatants were calculated from the standard curve and expressed as means ± SEM in ng/mg protein. Cross reactivity for other steroids, such as aldosterone or progesterone, was <2% or lower. Minimum detection of corticosterone by the kits was 0.156 ng/ml, and intra-assay and inter-assay variabilities were 5.0% and 7.1%, respectively. ACTH receptor via ELISA ACTH receptors and phosphorylated ACTH receptors were assayed in adrenal gland homogenates using ELISA kits from MyBiosource (San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were run in duplicate along with known standards in 96-well plates at room temperature. Plates were read on a plate reader set at 450 nm immediately after adding the stop solution. Data were expressed as means ± SEM in pg/mg protein. The sensitivity of the kit was 2.0 pg/ml. The detection range of the kit was 15.6–500.0 pg/ml. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) and inter-assay CV were less than 15%. Catecholamines via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Frozen aliquots of supernatant from adrenal tissue were thawed and diluted 1:5 in 0.1M HClO4. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were measured by HPLC using an ESA 582 isocratic pump, an ESA 542 autosampler, a Waters Atlantis T3 150 mm X 4.6 mm C18 reverse phase column, and an ESA Coulochem III detector with a 5011a cell set at +250 mV and -200 mV. The mobile phase was a 100 μM citric acid/phosphate buffer with 20% methanol pH 3.5. The assay volume was 50 μl. Values were expressed as a mean ± SEM in ng/mg protein. Metabolomics Frozen liver samples were shipped to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for analysis. Methanol extraction of small molecules was carried out, as described previously [39, 40], using 100 mg of liver tissue per sample. In addition, a small volume of each sample was utilized to create a pooled liver sample that was prepared in parallel and included as a technical replicate to assess variability and sensitivity in measurements, as described [39, 41]. The resulting extract was divided into four fractions for non-targeted metabolomics analysis [39, 40, 42]: one for analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS; positive mode), one for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS (negative mode), one for analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and one sample was reserved for backup. The UPLC-MS/MS platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC with Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm columns and a ThermoFisher LTQ mass spectrometer, which included an electrospray ionization source and a linear ion-trap mass analyzer. The instrumentation was set to monitor for positive ions in acidic extracts or negative ions in basic extracts through independent injections. The instrument was set to scan 80–1000 m/z (molecular weight) and alternated between MS and MS/MS scans. Samples destined for analysis by GC-MS were dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 18 hours prior to being derivatized using bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% diphenyl / 95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica column (20 m x 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 μm film thickness) with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60° to 340°C in a 17.5 min period. A Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power was utilized, and the scan range was from 50–750 m/z. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra, and curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon [43]. Identification of known chemical entities was based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of more than 4,000 purified standards. Raw area counts for each metabolite were re-scaled to set the medians to 1.0 for metabolites identified. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the platform used, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization. An estimate of the false discovery rate among metabolites identified as significantly different (p<0.05) between space flight livers and AEM controls was calculated to be 22% when applying the q-value method of Storey and Tibshirani [44]. RNA isolation RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. A maximum of 30-mg frozen liver/mouse tissue was used. Target preparation/processing for GeneChip analysis After isolation, RNA was frozen at -80°C and shipped on dry ice to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Genomics High-Throughput Facility (GHTF) for further analysis. The following protocol was provided by the UCI GHTF. Isolated total RNA samples were processed as recommended by Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). In brief, total RNA was initially isolated as described above and then put through an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for further clean up. Eluted total RNAs were quantified by NanoDrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE) and the concentrations of sample aliquots were adjusted to 100 ng/μl. Total RNA samples were assessed for quality prior to performing target preparation/processing steps by loading approximately 25–250 ng of each sample onto a RNA 6000 Nano LabChip, which was evaluated on an Agilent Biolanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The Ambion whole transcript (WT) expression kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to prepare RNA samples for whole transcriptome microarray analysis. Briefly, random hexamers that were tagged with a T7 promoter were used in first strand synthesis of cDNA. Then, using the T7 promoter, second strand synthesis was performed and the double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used as a template in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate many copies of antisense cRNA. Ten μg of antisense cRNA was input into a second cycle cDNA reaction using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers to produce single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation. The single-stranded DNA was fragmented to an average length of 70 bases and then labeled using a recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and an Affymetrix proprietary DNA labeling reagent that was covalently linked to biotin. Two μg of the labeled, fragmented single-stranded cDNA was hybridized at 45°C with rotation for 17 hours (Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640) to probe sets present on an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0ST array. The GeneChip arrays were washed and then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Fluidics protocol FS450_007). Arrays were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 to produce.CEL intensity files. The probe cell intensity files (*.CEL) were analyzed in Affymetrix Expression Console software v1.1.1 using the Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error (PLIER) algorithm to generate probe level summarization files (*.CHP). The settings used were algorithm-PLIER v2.0; quantification scale-Linear; quantification type-signal and detection P value; background-perfect match GC composition-based background correction (PM-GCBG); normalization method-sketch-quantile. Gene expression data were then processed via CARMAweb (Comprehensive R based Microarray Analysis web service) using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method to get fold changes for determining differential expression and p values. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to identify false positives. CARMAweb is a free, online tool hosted by Medical University Innsbruck [45]. Histology and immunohistochemistry PFA fixed, 5 μm tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously [46]. Additional histology sections were processed for Periodic Schiff Stain (PAS) and Picrosirius Red stain. Immunoreactivity was visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexafluor 488 or Alexafluor 594 at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:250, respectively. Nuclei were stained with 4‘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Immunofluorescence images were captured on a Nikon Diaphot fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and digitally deconvolved using the No Neighbors algorithm (Slidebook, Denver, CO) as described previously [46]. Histologic images were captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a four megapixel Macrofire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) using the PictureFrame Application 2.3 (Optronics). Cross-polarized light was also used to enhance visualization of Picrosiruis Red stained images as previously described [47]. All images were cropped and assembled using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Statistics Functional analysis of gene expression data provided by the UCI GHTF was performed at LLU using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen, Inc., Redwood City, CA). A z-score of < -2.0 or > 2.0 was considered significant. A P value of overlap < 0.05, indicates that the genes in our data set significantly overlap with the genes known to be involved with the function. Predicted effects are based on the literature and the measured effect of spaceflight. In some cases, the down-regulation of a specific gene may lead to an increase in functional activity and vice versa. The z-score represents the combined predicted response of all genes known to be explicitly involved in a particular function. All other data were analyzed using Sigmaplot 12.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) with an unpaired T-test; P<0.05 and P<0.1 indicating significance and trending, respectively.",
    "results": "Results Total body mass decreased after spaceflight but not significantly There were no significant differences in total body mass at the time of sacrifice (AEM 19.5 ± 0.5 g, Flight 18.4 ± 0.5 g). Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 7 for Flight. However, when calculated as a difference from preflight, baseline mass, we previously reported that spaceflight mice lost significantly more mass compared to AEM controls [35]. Decrease in splenocyte viability There was a significant decrease in viability of splenocytes noted in the ground control mice (P<0.001); 77% of splenocytes were viable in flight mice while only 68% were viable in ground controls. The difference in viability was likely due to a problem with shipping fresh tissues from the ground control mice from KSC to LLU (as described above). This difference in viability, although relatively small, must be considered in interpreting all assays involving “fresh” splenocytes presented below. Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 5 for Flight. Spaceflight decreased major splenic leukocyte subset counts There were significant flight-induced decreases in the total number of all major leukocyte populations (P<0.001, S2 Fig). In terms of proportions, spaceflight caused a shift toward lymphocytes (P<0.001) away from granulocytes (P<0.001), with no significant impact on monocyte/macrophage percentages. Spaceflight decreased splenic lymphocyte subset counts Spaceflight caused decreases in the total count of all measured lymphocyte subsets (S3 Fig) including T (P<0.001), Th (P<0.001), Tc (P<0.005), B (P<0.001) and NK (P<0.05) cells. In contrast, with the exception of an increase in Tc cells percentages (P<0.05), there was no significant impact of spaceflight on the proportions of any lymphocytes. The proportional increase in Tc cells led to a significant, flight-induced decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio (P<0.01), i.e., 1.6 for flight mice versus 2.0 for AEM ground controls. Spaceflight increased splenic background ROS & oxidative burst but decreased phagocytosis As indicated in Fig 1, we characterized the capacity of cells present in the spleen to generate an oxidative burst using both flow cytometry and a plate-based fluorescent assay. In both cases, we found significant spaceflight-induced increases (P<0.001). In contrast, there were decreases in phagocytic capacity in flight mice (P<0.001). Lastly, spaceflight increased the levels of unstimulated, background ROS (P<0.001). Fig 1. Effects of spaceflight on splenocyte phagocytic function.

Spaceflight increased adrenal corticosterone, decreased ACTH receptors, and did not impact catecholamine levels We observed a trend for a spaceflight-induced increase in corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands (P = 0.066, Fig 2). Although there were consistent decreases noted in ACTH receptors (total or phosphorylated), these also did not reach significance. However, the corticosterone/phosphorylated ACTH receptor ratio was greater in mice who experienced spaceflight (P<0.05, See S1 Table). Fig 2.

N = 11 for Ground controls, 7 for Flight.There were no significant signs of spaceflight-induced changes in the adrenal catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine (Fig 3). Similarly, although there was a slight elevation in dopamine in flight mice, this was not significant. However, this elevation resulted in significant increases in the dopamine/norepinephrine ratio in spaceflight mice (P<0.05, See S1 Table). Spaceflight tended to decrease the norepinephrine/corticosterone and epinephrine/corticosterone ratios (P = 0.068 and P = 0.056, respectively, S1 Table), but had no significant impact on the dopamine/corticosterone ratio.

Values represent means ± SEM. N = 13 for Ground controls, 7 for Flight. Spaceflight altered liver metabolite levels We performed untargeted metabolite profiling in the liver, comparing spaceflight and AEM ground controls. The effect of spaceflight on energy and lipid metabolism in these mice has been recently described [35]. Metabolites relevant to the current discussion are included in Table 1. We found significant increases in corticosterone as well as changes in some of the components of glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Specifically, there were decreases in GSH with corresponding increases in 2-aminobutyrate and ophthalmate, potentially indicative of increased oxidative stress. Osmolyte concentrations were altered, with increases in betaine and taurine, and decreases in alanine, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and hypotaurine observed. Finally, we found an increase in glycerol and decreased levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate, a measure of kidney function commonly characterized in the blood. Table 1.

Similarly, although there are multiple methods for analyzing the data (e.g. basic fold changes, pathway analysis, upstream transcription regulation analysis, etc.), here we focus on genes identified though a functional analysis via IPA. This analysis allowed us to identify genes that are both functionally related (based on the current state of the literature) and statistically correlated to spaceflight. This analysis takes into consideration that, in some cases, down-regulation of a particular gene may actually lead to the activation of a particular function, or vice versa. Table 2 lists a subset of the immune and oxidative stress-related functions identified by IPA to be significantly altered in the liver by spaceflight (z-score >2.0 for activation, <-2.0 for deactivation). Generally, spaceflight appears to have up-regulated functions related to viral infections (z > 4.2) and infections of cells (z > 2.8). Likely linked to this is the activation of clathrin- and receptor-mediated endocytosis (z > 3.1 and z > 2.7, respectively), fusion of late endosomes (z > 2.1) and formation of peroxisomes (z > 2.1).

Furthermore, although z-scores did not reach the level of significance, there also are trends for the down-regulation of functions related to oxidative stress and ROS metabolism (z < -1.7). Table 3 describes the functional analyses of genes in the liver related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism. In general, functions related to the generation and sequestration of glucose are up-regulated (z > 2.0) by spaceflight, while functions related to glycolysis are down-regulated (z < -2.0). There are also strong trends for increases in functions that involve the oxidation of lipids (z > 1.8). Table 3.

PEPCK (Pck1) was unchanged. Since insulin is associated with increased glycogen storage, we also performed IPA analysis on expression of gene transcripts in the insulin signaling pathway and found that gene expression levels were decreased in the flight mice for IRS1, IRS2, PI3K and much of the MAPK pathway (S4 Fig).

    "discussion": "Discussion Spaceflight appears to have had a significant impact on both immune and metabolomic function. These differences occur in the cell count and proportion data (see S1 Discussion), cell function, metabolites and in gene expression. As we will show, be believe these changes do not occur independently and are, in fact, linked. There were increases in background ROS levels measured in splenocytes ex vivo after flight, suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. High oxidative stress would be consistent with our results from STS-118 where we found increases in the expression of several genes in the liver involved in ROS scavenging and metabolism [5]. This would also be consistent with the increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio (due to the decrease noted in GSH levels) found in metabolomic analysis of the spaceflight livers noted here. However, although there was an increasing trend noted in another marker of oxidative stress, cysteine-glutathione disulfide, this did not reach the level of significance (Table 1). Furthermore, the increase in GSSG:GSH ratio was due primarily to a decrease in GSH with no corresponding increase in GSSG. While the decrease noted in cysteinyl-glycine (cys-gly) suggests that there may be less GSH breakdown with spaceflight, there were no significant changes in any of the quantified γ-glutamyl amino acids, nor in any other metabolic components of the cycle, including 5-oxoproline, glutamate, cysteine, or glycine. This suggests a more likely explanation for the observed metabolite changes is that there was a decrease in GSH synthesis leading to a lower capacity to deal with oxidative stress. The enzymes responsible for converting glutamate, cysteine, and glycine into GSH are glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS) (Fig 5). These enzymes are also part of another, separate branch of the pathway responsible for converting cystathionine (a precursor for cysteine) into ophthalmate. This is critical because although cystathionine decreased, both ophthalmate and its upstream precursor, 2-aminobutyrate, significantly increased after flight. This suggests that factors related to spaceflight are driving the kinetics of GCS towards ophthalmate production. Fig 5. Effects of spaceflight on GSH production. Open in a new tab This figure represents a combination of data generated through genomics and metabolomics. CTH = cystathionase. cys-gly = cysteinylglycine. GCS = glutamyl-cysteine synthase. GGT = gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. GS = glutathione synthase. GSH = glutathione. GSSG = glutathione (oxidized). Rectangles represent metabolomics data. Ovals represent genomics data. Grey = unchanged. Green = down-regulated. Red = up-regulated. Blue = specific transaminase unidentified. Interestingly, ophthalmate is an endogenous analog of GSH and may be a biomarker for oxidative stress and GSH depletion [48, 49]. Consistent with these reports is the possibility that chronic exposures to the spaceflight environment could lead to a situation where GSH is depleted to such an extent that corresponding increases in downstream products such as GSSG and γ-glutamyl-AA is no longer possible. However, this would not be consistent with our transcriptomics analysis discussed above. Further study is required to clarify these findings. As indicated in Fig 5, this switch in priorities is further suggested by our liver gene expression analysis. While there was no change in the expression of the GS gene, there was a significant decrease in GCS expression, confirming that GSH synthesis was down-regulated. Although there was a trend for a decrease in the expression of cystathionase, the enzyme for breaking cystathionine into cysteine + α-ketobutyrate, we were not able to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate. Taken together, these results suggest that although there was an overall decrease in cystathionine, some other mechanism(s) may be driving the remaining resources toward the generation of more ophthalmate. Why this should occur is not entirely clear. However, others have reported that ophthalmate levels are increased in the liver when GSH is depleted and the supply of cysteine to the liver is depleted [48]. The end result is a reduction in the level of GSH available to scavenge ROS. Despite these changes in individual genes, functional analysis of the liver genes via IPA did not indicate any generalized, consistent increases in overall oxidative stress responses. In fact, hepatocyte-specific oxidative stress response functions all trended toward being slightly down-regulated (Table 2). This suggested that something other than oxidative stress may be going on. Another possible explanation is that overall transaminase (or aminotransferase) levels increased as a consequence of muscle atrophy. Among other things, transaminases are involved in breaking proteins down into amino acids when blood sugar levels are low, usually at the expense of muscle tissue. This is interesting because spaceflight is known to induce muscle atrophy, in general, and was recently reported to do so in these mice specifically [50]. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate (Fig 5) and cannot verify this hypothesis. In addition to the increases in background ROS levels in splenocytes, there were large increases in the capacity to generate an oxidative burst in the splenocytes, despite the large decreases in cell counts. Because we did not isolate phagocytic populations for these ex vivo assays, the proportion of cells in the spleen after flight is of critical importance in interpreting this result. However, increases in burst activity occurred in spite of decreases in granulocyte proportions (and no change in monocyte/macrophages) suggesting that the respiratory burst activity of the cells themselves increased. There is very little in the literature describing the impact of spaceflight on ex vivo burst activity in splenocytes after spaceflight. Kaur et al. reported decreases in burst capacity in both monocytes [51] and neutrophils [52] from the blood of astronauts collected immediately after landing. Although we did not have the opportunity to measure oxidative burst capacity in the blood of our mice, this difference in response suggests that either the response is organ-specific and/or primed populations specifically traffic to lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. An increase in induced respiratory burst activity would be consistent with our liver gene expression data which showed a functional up-regulation in the formation of peroxisomes and the fusion of late endosomes (Table 2). However, as mentioned previously, there was a down-regulation in functions related to ROS metabolism. Interestingly, peroxisomes and late endosomes are also involved in lipid processing and metabolism, suggesting the increases in these cellular components may also reflect a change in gluconeogenesis [53]. Despite the increases in ROS activity, we found decreases in overall phagocytic activity in splenocytes after flight. Because this assay was performed ex vivo with a constant number of cells, and because we also saw decreases in some phagocyte proportions (e.g. granulocytes), a possible explanation for this decrease is a change in population distributions. However, the decrease in phagocytic activity (as measured by flow cytometry) was roughly 50% while the decrease in granulocyte percentage was only about 3%. We believe that it is unlikely that such a drastic decrease in phagocytic capacity would be due to such a small decrease in phagocyte proportions. Furthermore, decreases in phagocytic capacity have also been reported in both the macrophages and neutrophils in the blood of astronauts immediately after landing [51, 52]. One possible explanation for the changes in immunocyte distribution and function is psychological/physiological stress. In support of this is the trend for a spaceflight-induced up-regulation of adrenal levels of corticosterone, an indicator of increased hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. Metabolomic analysis of both the liver (presented here) and skin [54] of these mice showed similar increases in corticosterone levels. This is also generally consistent with reports of post-flight increases in circulating corticosterone levels in rodent models [7, 17, 26, 55]. A very recent study showed that cortisol levels generally increased in astronaut saliva in-flight compared to pre-flight levels, but this was only a trend [56]. Surprisingly, cortisol levels typically do not change in the blood of astronauts post-flight [31, 32, 57, 58]. There are even at least two reports of decreases in plasma cortisol levels in astronauts due to flight [59, 60]. In contrast, urinary cortisol levels typically increased after flight [31, 32, 57–61], but not always [51]. Since corticosterone is synthesized and released in the adrenal cortex and most endocrine tissues have tightly regulated homeostatic mechanisms that keep tissue levels within small discrete ranges (i.e., the amount of hormone being made is the same amount as that being released–allostasis), measuring adrenal corticosterone is not equivalent to measuring it in the blood or other organs. This suggests that the small difference in adrenal corticosterone levels between treatment groups reported here, despite fairly consistent increases found in other tissues, may actually be due to an increase in corticosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex to compensate for increased corticosterone secretion into the circulation. Decreases in spleen and thymus mass have long been associated with chronically elevated levels of corticosterone and stress [62–64]. We previously reported consistent decreases in spleen and thymus mass in these mice [1], as well as in rodents flown on STS-77 [18], -108 [2] and -118 [5]. While others have also reported decreases in spleen mass after flight [7, 9, 12, 14, 17], there is at least one report of an increase [55]. Similarly, thymus mass has generally been shown to decrease after flight [9, 12, 17], but there are some reports of increases [17, 55]. If spaceflight-subjected mice were indeed stressed as other findings here and in the literature suggest, particularly during the landing, then this should be reflected in ACTH activity. Adrenal corticosterone secretion is known to be up-regulated by ACTH receptor ligation on adrenocortical cells (predominantly in the zona fasciculata). An increase in corticosterone should be coincident with an increase in ACTH levels. Indeed, while plasma ACTH levels did not change in the blood of astronauts after flight [32, 58, 60], urinary ACTH levels increased [32]. Although we did not characterize adrenal ACTH levels directly, we did measure ACTH receptors. Because ACTH receptors are unique G protein-coupled receptors in that ligand activation up-regulates their expression [65–68], this should provide an indirect measure of ACTH activity and HPA activation. However, we did not find significant effects of spaceflight on ACTH receptor expression. Similarly, the percentage of phosphorylated ACTH receptors in the adrenals did not differ between treatment groups after flight. This would seem to suggest that the chronic exposure to the conditions of spaceflight promotes receptor desensitization and suggests that spaceflight may actually reduce the sensitivity to stress. Adrenal catecholamines are mediators of stress-induced activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) axis, and like corticosterone, their production and secretion into the circulation typically increases in response to stress. However, despite the noted increases in corticosterone, we found no changes in adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine levels. There is very little published in the literature involving activation of the SAM axis after spaceflight in rodent models. However, norepinephrine levels in the kidney of rats either do not change [69] or actually decreased [70] after spaceflight. Interestingly, urinary epinephrine levels did not change [31, 51, 52] or increased [32, 57, 60, 61] in astronauts after flight. Similarly, urinary norepinephrine levels either did not change [51, 52] or increased [31, 32, 57, 60]. Because urinary catecholamine levels are usually assessed using pooled samples collected over a 24-hour period post-landing, we believe that the reported increases are reflective of a response to the landing and not the actual spaceflight environment. These data suggest that while there may have been an activation of stress pathways after spaceflight, the response was relatively mild and likely did not involve both HPA and SNS activation. Although speculative, given the lack of a significant catecholamine response, it is possible that this elevation in corticosterone is not directly related to psychological stress at all. But rather, the change is related to energy balance and lipid metabolism. As previously stated, spaceflight has long been suspected to alter energy metabolism [71] and stress hormones like glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone) are known to play a significant role in metabolism [72, 73]. Indeed, corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissue to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Consistent with this idea is the fact that the metabolite, glycerol, was also more abundant in flight liver relative to ground controls. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) regulated activity increased significantly in the liver after flight. This is important because although the primary function of PPARs is to regulate lipid metabolism, PPARs can also negatively interfere with immune regulators including NF-κB, STAT, and AP-1 signaling pathways [74–79]. PPARs also mediate macrophage responses in the arterial cell wall [76, 77, 80, 81], both by interfering with chemoattraction and adhesion of immunocytes, including T cells and monocytes, and by down-regulating MCP-1 [82], RANTES [83], and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [75, 84]. We have demonstrated that lipid metabolism and PPAR activity are altered in spaceflight [35]. Given that many of the functional changes we see in immune response overlap considerably with energy/lipid metabolism, we believe that the two phenomena may actually be related. We observed a profound loss of glycogen stores in the livers of Flight mice. Paradoxically, most regulators of glycogen synthesis were increased, concomitant with a decrease in glycogen phosphorylase mRNA expression, pointing to upregulation of glycogenic rather than glycogenolytic pathways. This may be due, in part, to activation of compensatory mechanisms for restoring normal levels of glycogen stores. PEPCK (Pck1) mRNA expression was unchanged; therefore gluconeogenesis as a mechanism for restoring glycogen was likely not activated. We did not observe changes in hepatic glucose or glucose-6-phosphate concentrations and unfortunately did not have access to blood to measure serum glucose or insulin levels. However, the intracellular downregulation of IRS, PI3K and MAPK pathway genes are classical post-receptor manifestations of insulin resistance that may be induced by lipotoxicity, as we have previously shown [35]. Taken together, our data support the concept of spaceflight-induced alterations in the response to insulin that may correlate with insulin resistance. It will be important to obtain serum in future studies to measure insulin levels in mice and further pursue this link. In conclusion, spaceflight clearly causes transient changes in immune function. However, the cause may not be exclusively due to psychological or oxidative stress. But rather, the shifts in immune function may be at least partially due to shifts in energy needs in space. Onset of leukocyte regeneration after landing could, of course, also have a significant impact on functional status. As a full description of the impact of spaceflight on lipid metabolism is beyond the scope of this paper, the details of this have been covered elsewhere [35]. However, gene expression functional analysis indicated increases in functions related to glucose synthesis and sequestration, with corresponding decreases in glycolysis functions. Furthermore, the ex vivo increases in ROS activity, combined with corresponding increases in peroxisome and endosome-related gene expression, are likely related to spaceflight-induced shifts in lipid metabolism. This further suggests that spaceflight causes a shift in priorities in phagocytic populations away from antigen processing toward lipid processing, potentially increasing risk for infection.",

Copyright notice ID: 5443495 PMID: 28542224 Abstract The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.Introduction The final US Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, launched on July 8, 2011. After 12 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes, Space Shuttle Atlantis landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. One of the many experiments flown on this historic flight to the International Space Station (ISS) was BioServe Space Technology’s Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3). Sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the last animal flight of the shuttle era was intended to test the impact of their proprietary pharmaceutical agent on spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal atrophy. Participants in the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) were given the opportunity to analyze a subset of the placebo-treated mice (n = 5–10, depending on the assay and tissue) as long as it did not interfere with the primary science. Our research team at Loma Linda University (LLU) has participated in all three Amgen/CBTM flights (STS-108, -118, and -135) [1–6], giving us the unique opportunity to both repeat and expand on previous results. There are at least three, currently unavoidable components of the spaceflight environment that directly impact immune function. These include changes in the inertial environment (e.g. launch and landing loads, microgravity), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (e.g. solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays, and the Van Allen belts), and physiological/psychological stress (e.g. unloading, work-related stress). Ground-based studies have shown that each of these environmental factors alone can have an impact on immune function. Previously, we and others have shown that the spaceflight environment can have a dramatic influence on immunity. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight [2, 4]. Studies in both animal models and humans have shown that the spaceflight environment can influence total body, thymus and spleen mass [7–18], lymphocyte population distributions [18–25] and circulating corticosterone levels [16, 17, 26–33]. Interestingly, spaceflight is also known to alter energy/lipid metabolism [34, 35] and ground-based studies suggest that the stress marker, corticosterone/cortisol, plays a significant role [36]. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissues to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis [36]. As we demonstrate, metabolomic analysis of the liver indicates that glycerol was more abundant in flight mice relative to ground controls. Furthermore, data from the liver, skin and adrenal gland suggest that spaceflight caused a significant increase in corticosterone levels system-wide. These seemingly unrelated lines of investigation are important because there is a growing body of work describing the interaction between innate immunity and lipid metabolism (S1 Fig). Chronic inflammation is now accepted as a critical component in many pathologies and chronic diseases. Macrophages are not only among the first responders in host resistance to infection, but also have an underappreciated role in host health when metabolic changes occur [37]. For example, in obese people, increased numbers of liver and adipose tissue macrophages correlate with the development of metabolic syndrome [38]. In the current study we describe a more systemic response to microgravity by combining traditional measures of innate immune function (population distributions, oxidative burst capacity, phagocytosis) and stress responses (adrenal catecholamine and corticosterone levels) with ‘omics techniques (metabolomics and transcriptomics). We believe that, for the first time, we can begin to show the links between spaceflight-dependent immune dysfunction and changes in metabolism.Methods Mice and treatment On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched, 11 week old, female C57BL/6J mice (n = 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for ~13 days. There were two sets of ground controls housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC: Ground AEM controls (n = 10) and Vivarium controls (n = 8). Due to the nature of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP), we did not receive tissues from all mice for all assays. Sample sizes for individual assays are indicated where appropriate. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and CO2 levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-hour delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle; food (food bars developed by NASA Ames) and water was provided ad libitum. Vivarium control mice, housed in standard shoebox cages and fed standard rodent chow, were used to normalize cell counts, thus minimizing day-to-day variability. Mice were euthanized and dissected within 3–5 hours of landing. As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanization. Mice were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Samples were shipped to either LLU or University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and stored appropriately prior to use. These studies were approved by the NASA Ames and University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).Tissue handling Each spleen was cut in half at the time of dissection, placed into complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640) medium with 20% bovine calf serum and shipped on ice via overnight courier to LLU for further processing. Note: There was a problem with the courier shipping fresh tissues from the ground control mice from KSC to LLU. As a result, “fresh” ground control splenocyte samples were processed and assayed at LLU 48 hours after tissue collection. In contrast, “fresh” flight samples were processed and assayed roughly 24 hours post-tissue collection. This must be considered in interpreting all assays involving “fresh” splenocytes presented below. Only the assays that involved fresh splenic tissue were affected by this shipping error. These include flow cytometry, oxidative burst, background ROS, and phagocytosis assays. Adrenals were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of dissection and stored at -80°C until analysis. Liver lobes were extracted and dissected at the time of dissection. A portion of the sample was prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde. The rest of the liver was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis. Note: none of the liver or adrenal tissues were impacted by the shipping error.Splenocyte viability Spleen cell concentration was adjusted to 2 x 106 cells/ml and mixed with 0.4% trypan blue solution. The cell suspension was loaded onto CHT4 counting chamber slides and viability was assessed via the Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelcom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA).Splenic leukocyte quantification Splenocyte single-cell suspensions were diluted in RPMI-1640 medium and evaluated using the ABC Vet Hematology Analyzer (Heska Corp., Waukesha, WI) after lysis of erythrocytes by incubation in 2 ml of ammonium-chloride-potassium solution for 4 min at 4°C. Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets was performed on spleen using a FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., San Jose, CA). Monoclonal antibodies (MAb; BD Pharmingen, Inc., San Diego, CA) were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R-phycoerythrin (PE), allophycocyanin (APC), or peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP). MAb were directed against the following markers: CD3 (G4.18)–mature T cells; CD4 (OX-35)–T helper (Th) cells; CD8 (OX-8)–T cytotoxic (Tc) cells; CD45 (OX-1)–leukocytes; CD45R (HIS24)–B cells. We gated on the mononuclear population on a CD45 vs side scatter dot plot. At least 5,000 gated events/tube were evaluated using CellQuestTM software version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson). All cell count numbers were normalized to Vivarium controls and combined for the final analysis using the following equation: Final Data Point = [Measured Data Point] / [Average of Daily Vivarium Control] * [Average of All Controls for All Experiments].Splenocyte oxidative burst and background reactive oxygen species (ROS)–plate reader Spleen white blood cells (WBCs) were treated with zymosan A (for burst activity; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or medium (for background activity), and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a membrane-permeable diacetate derivative of DCFH. Upon entering cells the diacetate is cleaved enzymatically. Both the DCFH-DA and DCFH are non-fluorescent fluorescein analogues. They are oxidized to highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by H2O2 and hydroperoxides. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorometer at 485 nm excitation and 530 emission.Splenocyte oxidative burst and phagocytosis–flow cytometry Fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Trade name Pansorbin, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was stained with propidium iodide (PI) and used to quantify phagocytosis. DCFH-DA was used to quantify oxidative burst. Spleen cells were transferred into 5 ml tubes. DCFH-DA and PI-labeled S. aureus were added to the cells and allowed to incubate. Fluorescence was detected using a 4-color FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer. Analysis of 5,000 events/tube was performed using CellQuestTM software (v3.1).Adrenal tissue homogenate One adrenal gland from each mouse was weighed and homogenized using a Powergen homogenizer (Fischer Scientific, Tustin, CA) with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the other adrenal was homogenized with 500 μl of 0.1M HClO4. The samples were spun at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was aliquotted and frozen at -80°C until assayed. The supernatants were used to assess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. Samples homogenized in HClO4 were used to assess corticosterone, protein, and catecholamines.Total protein concentration in adrenals Total protein concentration was quantified in the adrenals using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA). Samples were run with protein standards ranging from 500 μg/ml to 7.8 μg/ml diluted with 0.1M HClO4.Corticosterone via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The adrenal glands from each mouse were homogenized. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Aliquots of frozen adrenal tissue supernatant were thawed, diluted 1:10 in assay buffer, and corticosterone was measured using an ELISA kit for mouse corticosterone from AssayPro (St. Charles, MO), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Plates containing duplicate samples and standards were read on a microplate reader set at 450 nm. Corticosterone levels in adrenal supernatants were calculated from the standard curve and expressed as means ± SEM in ng/mg protein. Cross reactivity for other steroids, such as aldosterone or progesterone, was <2% or lower. Minimum detection of corticosterone by the kits was 0.156 ng/ml, and intra-assay and inter-assay variabilities were 5.0% and 7.1%, respectively.ACTH receptor via ELISA ACTH receptors and phosphorylated ACTH receptors were assayed in adrenal gland homogenates using ELISA kits from MyBiosource (San Diego, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were run in duplicate along with known standards in 96-well plates at room temperature. Plates were read on a plate reader set at 450 nm immediately after adding the stop solution. Data were expressed as means ± SEM in pg/mg protein. The sensitivity of the kit was 2.0 pg/ml. The detection range of the kit was 15.6–500.0 pg/ml. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) and inter-assay CV were less than 15%.Catecholamines via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Frozen aliquots of supernatant from adrenal tissue were thawed and diluted 1:5 in 0.1M HClO4. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine were measured by HPLC using an ESA 582 isocratic pump, an ESA 542 autosampler, a Waters Atlantis T3 150 mm X 4.6 mm C18 reverse phase column, and an ESA Coulochem III detector with a 5011a cell set at +250 mV and -200 mV. The mobile phase was a 100 μM citric acid/phosphate buffer with 20% methanol pH 3.5. The assay volume was 50 μl. Values were expressed as a mean ± SEM in ng/mg protein.Metabolomics Frozen liver samples were shipped to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for analysis. Methanol extraction of small molecules was carried out, as described previously [39, 40], using 100 mg of liver tissue per sample. In addition, a small volume of each sample was utilized to create a pooled liver sample that was prepared in parallel and included as a technical replicate to assess variability and sensitivity in measurements, as described [39, 41]. The resulting extract was divided into four fractions for non-targeted metabolomics analysis [39, 40, 42]: one for analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS; positive mode), one for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS (negative mode), one for analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and one sample was reserved for backup. The UPLC-MS/MS platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC with Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm columns and a ThermoFisher LTQ mass spectrometer, which included an electrospray ionization source and a linear ion-trap mass analyzer. The instrumentation was set to monitor for positive ions in acidic extracts or negative ions in basic extracts through independent injections. The instrument was set to scan 80–1000 m/z (molecular weight) and alternated between MS and MS/MS scans. Samples destined for analysis by GC-MS were dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 18 hours prior to being derivatized using bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% diphenyl / 95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica column (20 m x 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 μm film thickness) with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60° to 340°C in a 17.5 min period. A Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power was utilized, and the scan range was from 50–750 m/z. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra, and curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon [43]. Identification of known chemical entities was based on comparison to metabolomic library entries of more than 4,000 purified standards. Raw area counts for each metabolite were re-scaled to set the medians to 1.0 for metabolites identified. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the platform used, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization. An estimate of the false discovery rate among metabolites identified as significantly different (p<0.05) between space flight livers and AEM controls was calculated to be 22% when applying the q-value method of Storey and Tibshirani [44].RNA isolation RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. A maximum of 30-mg frozen liver/mouse tissue was used.Target preparation/processing for GeneChip analysis After isolation, RNA was frozen at -80°C and shipped on dry ice to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Genomics High-Throughput Facility (GHTF) for further analysis. The following protocol was provided by the UCI GHTF. Isolated total RNA samples were processed as recommended by Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript Sense Target Labeling Assay Manual, Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). In brief, total RNA was initially isolated as described above and then put through an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for further clean up. Eluted total RNAs were quantified by NanoDrop (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE) and the concentrations of sample aliquots were adjusted to 100 ng/μl. Total RNA samples were assessed for quality prior to performing target preparation/processing steps by loading approximately 25–250 ng of each sample onto a RNA 6000 Nano LabChip, which was evaluated on an Agilent Biolanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The Ambion whole transcript (WT) expression kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to prepare RNA samples for whole transcriptome microarray analysis. Briefly, random hexamers that were tagged with a T7 promoter were used in first strand synthesis of cDNA. Then, using the T7 promoter, second strand synthesis was performed and the double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used as a template in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate many copies of antisense cRNA. Ten μg of antisense cRNA was input into a second cycle cDNA reaction using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers to produce single-stranded DNA in the sense orientation. The single-stranded DNA was fragmented to an average length of 70 bases and then labeled using a recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and an Affymetrix proprietary DNA labeling reagent that was covalently linked to biotin. Two μg of the labeled, fragmented single-stranded cDNA was hybridized at 45°C with rotation for 17 hours (Affymetrix GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640) to probe sets present on an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0ST array. The GeneChip arrays were washed and then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Fluidics protocol FS450_007). Arrays were scanned using GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 to produce.CEL intensity files. The probe cell intensity files (*.CEL) were analyzed in Affymetrix Expression Console software v1.1.1 using the Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error (PLIER) algorithm to generate probe level summarization files (*.CHP). The settings used were algorithm-PLIER v2.0; quantification scale-Linear; quantification type-signal and detection P value; background-perfect match GC composition-based background correction (PM-GCBG); normalization method-sketch-quantile. Gene expression data were then processed via CARMAweb (Comprehensive R based Microarray Analysis web service) using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method to get fold changes for determining differential expression and p values. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to identify false positives. CARMAweb is a free, online tool hosted by Medical University Innsbruck [45].Histology and immunohistochemistry PFA fixed, 5 μm tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously [46]. Additional histology sections were processed for Periodic Schiff Stain (PAS) and Picrosirius Red stain. Immunoreactivity was visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexafluor 488 or Alexafluor 594 at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:250, respectively. Nuclei were stained with 4‘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Immunofluorescence images were captured on a Nikon Diaphot fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and digitally deconvolved using the No Neighbors algorithm (Slidebook, Denver, CO) as described previously [46]. Histologic images were captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a four megapixel Macrofire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) using the PictureFrame Application 2.3 (Optronics). Cross-polarized light was also used to enhance visualization of Picrosiruis Red stained images as previously described [47]. All images were cropped and assembled using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA).Statistics Functional analysis of gene expression data provided by the UCI GHTF was performed at LLU using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen, Inc., Redwood City, CA). A z-score of < -2.0 or > 2.0 was considered significant. A P value of overlap < 0.05, indicates that the genes in our data set significantly overlap with the genes known to be involved with the function. Predicted effects are based on the literature and the measured effect of spaceflight. In some cases, the down-regulation of a specific gene may lead to an increase in functional activity and vice versa. The z-score represents the combined predicted response of all genes known to be explicitly involved in a particular function. All other data were analyzed using Sigmaplot 12.0 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) with an unpaired T-test; P<0.05 and P<0.1 indicating significance and trending, respectively.Results Total body mass decreased after spaceflight but not significantly There were no significant differences in total body mass at the time of sacrifice (AEM 19.5 ± 0.5 g, Flight 18.4 ± 0.5 g). Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 7 for Flight. However, when calculated as a difference from preflight, baseline mass, we previously reported that spaceflight mice lost significantly more mass compared to AEM controls [35].Decrease in splenocyte viability There was a significant decrease in viability of splenocytes noted in the ground control mice (P<0.001); 77% of splenocytes were viable in flight mice while only 68% were viable in ground controls. The difference in viability was likely due to a problem with shipping fresh tissues from the ground control mice from KSC to LLU (as described above). This difference in viability, although relatively small, must be considered in interpreting all assays involving “fresh” splenocytes presented below. Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 5 for Flight.Spaceflight decreased major splenic leukocyte subset counts There were significant flight-induced decreases in the total number of all major leukocyte populations (P<0.001, S2 Fig). In terms of proportions, spaceflight caused a shift toward lymphocytes (P<0.001) away from granulocytes (P<0.001), with no significant impact on monocyte/macrophage percentages.Spaceflight decreased splenic lymphocyte subset counts Spaceflight caused decreases in the total count of all measured lymphocyte subsets (S3 Fig) including T (P<0.001), Th (P<0.001), Tc (P<0.005), B (P<0.001) and NK (P<0.05) cells. In contrast, with the exception of an increase in Tc cells percentages (P<0.05), there was no significant impact of spaceflight on the proportions of any lymphocytes. The proportional increase in Tc cells led to a significant, flight-induced decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio (P<0.01), i.e., 1.6 for flight mice versus 2.0 for AEM ground controls.Spaceflight increased splenic background ROS & oxidative burst but decreased phagocytosis As indicated in Fig 1, we characterized the capacity of cells present in the spleen to generate an oxidative burst using both flow cytometry and a plate-based fluorescent assay. In both cases, we found significant spaceflight-induced increases (P<0.001). In contrast, there were decreases in phagocytic capacity in flight mice (P<0.001). Lastly, spaceflight increased the levels of unstimulated, background ROS (P<0.001). Fig 1. Effects of spaceflight on splenocyte phagocytic function. Open in a new tab Flow = Flow cytometry based assay. Plate = 96 well/fluorescence-based assay. Values represent means ± SEM. N = 8 for Ground controls, 5 for Flight. *P<0.001.Spaceflight increased adrenal corticosterone, decreased ACTH receptors, and did not impact catecholamine levels We observed a trend for a spaceflight-induced increase in corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands (P = 0.066, Fig 2). Although there were consistent decreases noted in ACTH receptors (total or phosphorylated), these also did not reach significance. However, the corticosterone/phosphorylated ACTH receptor ratio was greater in mice who experienced spaceflight (P<0.05, See S1 Table). Fig 2. Effects of spaceflight on corticosterone and ACTH receptor levels in the adrenal gland. Open in a new tab Corticosterone was quantified via ELISA. Values represent means ± SEM. N = 8 for Ground controls, 5 for Flight. T = trend, P = 0.066. ACTH receptor (ACTH-r) levels quantified via ELISA. p-ACTH-r = phosphorylated ACTH-r. Values represent means ± SEM. N = 11 for Ground controls, 7 for Flight.There were no significant signs of spaceflight-induced changes in the adrenal catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine (Fig 3). Similarly, although there was a slight elevation in dopamine in flight mice, this was not significant. However, this elevation resulted in significant increases in the dopamine/norepinephrine ratio in spaceflight mice (P<0.05, See S1 Table). Spaceflight tended to decrease the norepinephrine/corticosterone and epinephrine/corticosterone ratios (P = 0.068 and P = 0.056, respectively, S1 Table), but had no significant impact on the dopamine/corticosterone ratio.

Values represent means ± SEM. N = 13 for Ground controls, 7 for Flight.Spaceflight altered liver metabolite levels We performed untargeted metabolite profiling in the liver, comparing spaceflight and AEM ground controls. The effect of spaceflight on energy and lipid metabolism in these mice has been recently described [35]. Metabolites relevant to the current discussion are included in Table 1. We found significant increases in corticosterone as well as changes in some of the components of glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Specifically, there were decreases in GSH with corresponding increases in 2-aminobutyrate and ophthalmate, potentially indicative of increased oxidative stress. Osmolyte concentrations were altered, with increases in betaine and taurine, and decreases in alanine, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and hypotaurine observed. Finally, we found an increase in glycerol and decreased levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate, a measure of kidney function commonly characterized in the blood. Table 1.

Similarly, although there are multiple methods for analyzing the data (e.g. basic fold changes, pathway analysis, upstream transcription regulation analysis, etc.), here we focus on genes identified though a functional analysis via IPA. This analysis allowed us to identify genes that are both functionally related (based on the current state of the literature) and statistically correlated to spaceflight. This analysis takes into consideration that, in some cases, down-regulation of a particular gene may actually lead to the activation of a particular function, or vice versa. Table 2 lists a subset of the immune and oxidative stress-related functions identified by IPA to be significantly altered in the liver by spaceflight (z-score >2.0 for activation, <-2.0 for deactivation). Generally, spaceflight appears to have up-regulated functions related to viral infections (z > 4.2) and infections of cells (z > 2.8). Likely linked to this is the activation of clathrin- and receptor-mediated endocytosis (z > 3.1 and z > 2.7, respectively), fusion of late endosomes (z > 2.1) and formation of peroxisomes (z > 2.1).

Furthermore, although z-scores did not reach the level of significance, there also are trends for the down-regulation of functions related to oxidative stress and ROS metabolism (z < -1.7). Table 3 describes the functional analyses of genes in the liver related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism. In general, functions related to the generation and sequestration of glucose are up-regulated (z > 2.0) by spaceflight, while functions related to glycolysis are down-regulated (z < -2.0). There are also strong trends for increases in functions that involve the oxidation of lipids (z > 1.8). Table 3.

PEPCK (Pck1) was unchanged. Since insulin is associated with increased glycogen storage, we also performed IPA analysis on expression of gene transcripts in the insulin signaling pathway and found that gene expression levels were decreased in the flight mice for IRS1, IRS2, PI3K and much of the MAPK pathway (S4 Fig).

A representative image from n = 5 mice per group is shown.Discussion Spaceflight appears to have had a significant impact on both immune and metabolomic function. These differences occur in the cell count and proportion data (see S1 Discussion), cell function, metabolites and in gene expression. As we will show, be believe these changes do not occur independently and are, in fact, linked. There were increases in background ROS levels measured in splenocytes ex vivo after flight, suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. High oxidative stress would be consistent with our results from STS-118 where we found increases in the expression of several genes in the liver involved in ROS scavenging and metabolism [5]. This would also be consistent with the increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio (due to the decrease noted in GSH levels) found in metabolomic analysis of the spaceflight livers noted here. However, although there was an increasing trend noted in another marker of oxidative stress, cysteine-glutathione disulfide, this did not reach the level of significance (Table 1). Furthermore, the increase in GSSG:GSH ratio was due primarily to a decrease in GSH with no corresponding increase in GSSG. While the decrease noted in cysteinyl-glycine (cys-gly) suggests that there may be less GSH breakdown with spaceflight, there were no significant changes in any of the quantified γ-glutamyl amino acids, nor in any other metabolic components of the cycle, including 5-oxoproline, glutamate, cysteine, or glycine. This suggests a more likely explanation for the observed metabolite changes is that there was a decrease in GSH synthesis leading to a lower capacity to deal with oxidative stress. The enzymes responsible for converting glutamate, cysteine, and glycine into GSH are glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS) (Fig 5). These enzymes are also part of another, separate branch of the pathway responsible for converting cystathionine (a precursor for cysteine) into ophthalmate. This is critical because although cystathionine decreased, both ophthalmate and its upstream precursor, 2-aminobutyrate, significantly increased after flight. This suggests that factors related to spaceflight are driving the kinetics of GCS towards ophthalmate production. Fig 5. Effects of spaceflight on GSH production. Open in a new tab This figure represents a combination of data generated through genomics and metabolomics. CTH = cystathionase. cys-gly = cysteinylglycine. GCS = glutamyl-cysteine synthase. GGT = gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. GS = glutathione synthase. GSH = glutathione. GSSG = glutathione (oxidized). Rectangles represent metabolomics data. Ovals represent genomics data. Grey = unchanged. Green = down-regulated. Red = up-regulated. Blue = specific transaminase unidentified.Interestingly, ophthalmate is an endogenous analog of GSH and may be a biomarker for oxidative stress and GSH depletion [48, 49]. Consistent with these reports is the possibility that chronic exposures to the spaceflight environment could lead to a situation where GSH is depleted to such an extent that corresponding increases in downstream products such as GSSG and γ-glutamyl-AA is no longer possible. However, this would not be consistent with our transcriptomics analysis discussed above. Further study is required to clarify these findings. As indicated in Fig 5, this switch in priorities is further suggested by our liver gene expression analysis. While there was no change in the expression of the GS gene, there was a significant decrease in GCS expression, confirming that GSH synthesis was down-regulated. Although there was a trend for a decrease in the expression of cystathionase, the enzyme for breaking cystathionine into cysteine + α-ketobutyrate, we were not able to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate. Taken together, these results suggest that although there was an overall decrease in cystathionine, some other mechanism(s) may be driving the remaining resources toward the generation of more ophthalmate. Why this should occur is not entirely clear. However, others have reported that ophthalmate levels are increased in the liver when GSH is depleted and the supply of cysteine to the liver is depleted [48]. The end result is a reduction in the level of GSH available to scavenge ROS. Despite these changes in individual genes, functional analysis of the liver genes via IPA did not indicate any generalized, consistent increases in overall oxidative stress responses. In fact, hepatocyte-specific oxidative stress response functions all trended toward being slightly down-regulated (Table 2). This suggested that something other than oxidative stress may be going on. Another possible explanation is that overall transaminase (or aminotransferase) levels increased as a consequence of muscle atrophy. Among other things, transaminases are involved in breaking proteins down into amino acids when blood sugar levels are low, usually at the expense of muscle tissue. This is interesting because spaceflight is known to induce muscle atrophy, in general, and was recently reported to do so in these mice specifically [50]. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate (Fig 5) and cannot verify this hypothesis. In addition to the increases in background ROS levels in splenocytes, there were large increases in the capacity to generate an oxidative burst in the splenocytes, despite the large decreases in cell counts. Because we did not isolate phagocytic populations for these ex vivo assays, the proportion of cells in the spleen after flight is of critical importance in interpreting this result. However, increases in burst activity occurred in spite of decreases in granulocyte proportions (and no change in monocyte/macrophages) suggesting that the respiratory burst activity of the cells themselves increased. There is very little in the literature describing the impact of spaceflight on ex vivo burst activity in splenocytes after spaceflight. Kaur et al. reported decreases in burst capacity in both monocytes [51] and neutrophils [52] from the blood of astronauts collected immediately after landing. Although we did not have the opportunity to measure oxidative burst capacity in the blood of our mice, this difference in response suggests that either the response is organ-specific and/or primed populations specifically traffic to lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. An increase in induced respiratory burst activity would be consistent with our liver gene expression data which showed a functional up-regulation in the formation of peroxisomes and the fusion of late endosomes (Table 2). However, as mentioned previously, there was a down-regulation in functions related to ROS metabolism. Interestingly, peroxisomes and late endosomes are also involved in lipid processing and metabolism, suggesting the increases in these cellular components may also reflect a change in gluconeogenesis [53]. Despite the increases in ROS activity, we found decreases in overall phagocytic activity in splenocytes after flight. Because this assay was performed ex vivo with a constant number of cells, and because we also saw decreases in some phagocyte proportions (e.g. granulocytes), a possible explanation for this decrease is a change in population distributions. However, the decrease in phagocytic activity (as measured by flow cytometry) was roughly 50% while the decrease in granulocyte percentage was only about 3%. We believe that it is unlikely that such a drastic decrease in phagocytic capacity would be due to such a small decrease in phagocyte proportions. Furthermore, decreases in phagocytic capacity have also been reported in both the macrophages and neutrophils in the blood of astronauts immediately after landing [51, 52]. One possible explanation for the changes in immunocyte distribution and function is psychological/physiological stress. In support of this is the trend for a spaceflight-induced up-regulation of adrenal levels of corticosterone, an indicator of increased hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. Metabolomic analysis of both the liver (presented here) and skin [54] of these mice showed similar increases in corticosterone levels. This is also generally consistent with reports of post-flight increases in circulating corticosterone levels in rodent models [7, 17, 26, 55]. A very recent study showed that cortisol levels generally increased in astronaut saliva in-flight compared to pre-flight levels, but this was only a trend [56]. Surprisingly, cortisol levels typically do not change in the blood of astronauts post-flight [31, 32, 57, 58]. There are even at least two reports of decreases in plasma cortisol levels in astronauts due to flight [59, 60]. In contrast, urinary cortisol levels typically increased after flight [31, 32, 57–61], but not always [51]. Since corticosterone is synthesized and released in the adrenal cortex and most endocrine tissues have tightly regulated homeostatic mechanisms that keep tissue levels within small discrete ranges (i.e., the amount of hormone being made is the same amount as that being released–allostasis), measuring adrenal corticosterone is not equivalent to measuring it in the blood or other organs. This suggests that the small difference in adrenal corticosterone levels between treatment groups reported here, despite fairly consistent increases found in other tissues, may actually be due to an increase in corticosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex to compensate for increased corticosterone secretion into the circulation. Decreases in spleen and thymus mass have long been associated with chronically elevated levels of corticosterone and stress [62–64]. We previously reported consistent decreases in spleen and thymus mass in these mice [1], as well as in rodents flown on STS-77 [18], -108 [2] and -118 [5]. While others have also reported decreases in spleen mass after flight [7, 9, 12, 14, 17], there is at least one report of an increase [55]. Similarly, thymus mass has generally been shown to decrease after flight [9, 12, 17], but there are some reports of increases [17, 55]. If spaceflight-subjected mice were indeed stressed as other findings here and in the literature suggest, particularly during the landing, then this should be reflected in ACTH activity. Adrenal corticosterone secretion is known to be up-regulated by ACTH receptor ligation on adrenocortical cells (predominantly in the zona fasciculata). An increase in corticosterone should be coincident with an increase in ACTH levels. Indeed, while plasma ACTH levels did not change in the blood of astronauts after flight [32, 58, 60], urinary ACTH levels increased [32]. Although we did not characterize adrenal ACTH levels directly, we did measure ACTH receptors. Because ACTH receptors are unique G protein-coupled receptors in that ligand activation up-regulates their expression [65–68], this should provide an indirect measure of ACTH activity and HPA activation. However, we did not find significant effects of spaceflight on ACTH receptor expression. Similarly, the percentage of phosphorylated ACTH receptors in the adrenals did not differ between treatment groups after flight. This would seem to suggest that the chronic exposure to the conditions of spaceflight promotes receptor desensitization and suggests that spaceflight may actually reduce the sensitivity to stress. Adrenal catecholamines are mediators of stress-induced activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) axis, and like corticosterone, their production and secretion into the circulation typically increases in response to stress. However, despite the noted increases in corticosterone, we found no changes in adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine levels. There is very little published in the literature involving activation of the SAM axis after spaceflight in rodent models. However, norepinephrine levels in the kidney of rats either do not change [69] or actually decreased [70] after spaceflight. Interestingly, urinary epinephrine levels did not change [31, 51, 52] or increased [32, 57, 60, 61] in astronauts after flight. Similarly, urinary norepinephrine levels either did not change [51, 52] or increased [31, 32, 57, 60]. Because urinary catecholamine levels are usually assessed using pooled samples collected over a 24-hour period post-landing, we believe that the reported increases are reflective of a response to the landing and not the actual spaceflight environment. These data suggest that while there may have been an activation of stress pathways after spaceflight, the response was relatively mild and likely did not involve both HPA and SNS activation. Although speculative, given the lack of a significant catecholamine response, it is possible that this elevation in corticosterone is not directly related to psychological stress at all. But rather, the change is related to energy balance and lipid metabolism. As previously stated, spaceflight has long been suspected to alter energy metabolism [71] and stress hormones like glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone) are known to play a significant role in metabolism [72, 73]. Indeed, corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissue to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Consistent with this idea is the fact that the metabolite, glycerol, was also more abundant in flight liver relative to ground controls. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) regulated activity increased significantly in the liver after flight. This is important because although the primary function of PPARs is to regulate lipid metabolism, PPARs can also negatively interfere with immune regulators including NF-κB, STAT, and AP-1 signaling pathways [74–79]. PPARs also mediate macrophage responses in the arterial cell wall [76, 77, 80, 81], both by interfering with chemoattraction and adhesion of immunocytes, including T cells and monocytes, and by down-regulating MCP-1 [82], RANTES [83], and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [75, 84]. We have demonstrated that lipid metabolism and PPAR activity are altered in spaceflight [35]. Given that many of the functional changes we see in immune response overlap considerably with energy/lipid metabolism, we believe that the two phenomena may actually be related. We observed a profound loss of glycogen stores in the livers of Flight mice. Paradoxically, most regulators of glycogen synthesis were increased, concomitant with a decrease in glycogen phosphorylase mRNA expression, pointing to upregulation of glycogenic rather than glycogenolytic pathways. This may be due, in part, to activation of compensatory mechanisms for restoring normal levels of glycogen stores. PEPCK (Pck1) mRNA expression was unchanged; therefore gluconeogenesis as a mechanism for restoring glycogen was likely not activated. We did not observe changes in hepatic glucose or glucose-6-phosphate concentrations and unfortunately did not have access to blood to measure serum glucose or insulin levels. However, the intracellular downregulation of IRS, PI3K and MAPK pathway genes are classical post-receptor manifestations of insulin resistance that may be induced by lipotoxicity, as we have previously shown [35]. Taken together, our data support the concept of spaceflight-induced alterations in the response to insulin that may correlate with insulin resistance. It will be important to obtain serum in future studies to measure insulin levels in mice and further pursue this link. In conclusion, spaceflight clearly causes transient changes in immune function. However, the cause may not be exclusively due to psychological or oxidative stress. But rather, the shifts in immune function may be at least partially due to shifts in energy needs in space. Onset of leukocyte regeneration after landing could, of course, also have a significant impact on functional status. As a full description of the impact of spaceflight on lipid metabolism is beyond the scope of this paper, the details of this have been covered elsewhere [35]. However, gene expression functional analysis indicated increases in functions related to glucose synthesis and sequestration, with corresponding decreases in glycolysis functions. Furthermore, the ex vivo increases in ROS activity, combined with corresponding increases in peroxisome and endosome-related gene expression, are likely related to spaceflight-induced shifts in lipid metabolism. This further suggests that spaceflight causes a shift in priorities in phagocytic populations away from antigen processing toward lipid processing, potentially increasing risk for infection.Supporting information S1 Fig. Proposed model linking spaceflight-induced disruptions in innate immune function and metabolism.(TIF) Click here for additional data file.

    "abstract": "Abstract Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment. Keywords: spaceflight, autophagy, proteasome, metabolomics, tRNA biosynthesis, senescence",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Long-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13]. Excessive ROS production, without a corresponding upregulation in antioxidant or ROS scavenger pathways, can cause damage to cellular components including DNA, proteins and lipids, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway [14]. This can lead to cell cycle arrest, activation of senescence or apoptosis and upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules, causing widespread organelle, cell and tissue damage [15]. Under conditions of chronic exposure to oxidative stress (such as in spaceflight), an imbalance occurs between ROS production and antioxidant quenching resulting in increased cellular and tissue damage [16,17,18]. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to damage by excess ROS and we hypothesized that the liver, a mitochondria-rich metabolic organ, may be a target of spaceflight-induced deficits. In support of this hypothesis, astronauts were shown to exhibit a mild diabetogenic phenotype following spaceflight, the severity of which was linked with flight duration [19,20]. We previously demonstrated that mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (Space Transportation System (STS)-135) for 13.5 days exhibited a significantly impaired response to oxidative stress evidenced by decreased hepatic levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH, reduced), with concomitant increased ophthalmate, a biomarker for depletion of glutathione, and increased ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG):GSH [21]. Other spaceflight-induced changes in hepatic genes linked to oxidative defense have also been observed [13]. Our targeted analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets obtained from livers of spaceflight mice showed dysregulation of pathways involved in both lipid metabolism and the immune response, with signs of retinoid export and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathways suggestive of nascent hepatic fat accretion and collagen deposition. Proteomics data acquired from mice exposed to space for 30 days exhibited similar patterns when compared with mice re-acclimated to ground conditions [22]. Our previous integrated data analysis utilized a limited set of genes and metabolites that were elevated in abundance in spaceflight mice as compared with ground controls and were tightly correlated with histological evidence of increased hepatic lipid accumulation. The goal of the present study was to perform unbiased, integrated analyses using the entire metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets to determine whether additional insights into the effects of exposure to the space environment on liver metabolism and cellular function could be gleaned. Utilizing several enrichment algorithms, we determined that degradation and senescence programs were altered in spaceflight mice in concert with attenuation of oxidative defense networks.",
    "methods": "3. Materials and Methods Animal studies were reviewed and approved by multiple Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) boards, including the NASA Ames Research Center ACUC (NAS-11-002-Y1; 31 May 2011), the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ACUC (FLT-11-078; 23 May 2011) and the University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional ACUC (1104.11; 10 May 2011). No protocol was required for assays performed at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center or Loma Linda University since only tissues obtained after euthanasia (no live animals) were analyzed at our sites. All NASA studies involving vertebrate animals were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. 3.1. Animals and Sample Collection Nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice were selected for this study because they produce fewer odor annoyance issues and were the only gender approved for flight (n = 15/group). Additionally, all historical data (e.g., STS-118) were obtained on female mice so the use of female mice permitted comparisons across missions, particularly for the musculoskeletal studies that were primary. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 10 mice per AEM habitat; 5 per side separated by a wire mesh) and either flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days (FLT) or housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC (Ground AEM controls; AEM). Following two days of acclimation after receipt, mice were provided a NASA NuRFB foodbar (TD 04197; 47% carbohydrate, 17.9% protein, 3.9% lipids, 2.8% fiber, 2.80 kcal/g). All mice were placed into AEM housing one day before flight. Environmental parameters for ground control mice were matched as closely as possible with flight conditions using 48 h delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle; foodbars and water were provided ad libitum. Tissues were harvested at the SLSL within 3–5 h after return of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and were distributed amongst a team of investigations through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program; we received one half lobe of liver from six mice per group. Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Liver lobes were extracted and dissected. A portion of the liver was prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde and the rest snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then shipped to either Loma Linda University or University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and stored appropriately prior to use. 3.2. Transcriptomics Samples were prepared and analyzed as previously described [4,5]. Briefly, RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and the Ambion WT expression kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was employed to prepare mRNA for whole transcriptome microarray analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0 ST array (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Arrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to produce. CEL intensity files which were processed with CARMAweb (Comprehensive R-based Microarray Analysis web service). GeneSpring software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to perform statistical analysis. Specifically, samples were first filtered on signal intensity values in order to remove background noise, statistical analysis was performed on normalized and filtered samples using a moderated t-test with Benjamini Hochberg FDR correction factor. Samples were then filtered based on fold change, whereby p (corr) < 0.05 and fold change +/− 1.5 or more was considered significant. CARMAweb files were then imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) software for subsequent analysis. 3.3. Metabolomics Frozen liver pieces (n = 6/group) were shipped to Metabolon, Inc. (Morrisville, NC, USA) and stored at −80 °C before use. Samples were prepared for the appropriate instrument, either Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) or Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), as described previously [4,5]. Briefly, automated sample preparation was conducted to extract metabolites for analysis by LC and GC. Extracts were placed briefly on a TurboVap® (Zymark, Clackamas, OR, USA) to remove organic solvent. Each extract was then frozen and dried under vacuum. 3.4. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) Extracts were split into two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. Metabolite features were measured using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns as described previously [4,5]. One aliquot was analyzed in positive ion mode under acidic conditions and gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C18 2.1 mm × 100 mm column, containing 1.7 µm resin, using water and methanol as mobile phases with both containing 0.1% formic acid. The other aliquot was analyzed in negative ion mode using basic conditions, which also employed water/methanol, and contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate for ion pairing. Mass spectrometric analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80–1000 m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm. 3.5. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Extracts destined for GC/MS were vacuum desiccated for 24 h then derivatized under dried nitrogen using bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Volatile metabolites were separated using 5% phenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica (20 m × 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 µm film thickness) and a temperature ramp from 40 to 300 °C within 16 min; helium was used as the carrier gas. Compounds were analyzed using a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with electron impact ionization set to scan from 50–750 m/z at unit mass resolving power, as we previously described [4,5]. 3.6. Compound Identification Mass spectral data were loaded into a relational database and peaks were identified using Metabolon’s peak integration software [63]. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards based on the combination of retention time and mass spectra. Data were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Each compound was corrected by registering the medians to equal 1.00 in run-day blocks and normalizing each data point proportionately. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the instrument, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization. 3.7. Data Availability Transcriptomics and metabolomics data are publicly accessible via the NASA GeneLAB data base. Transcriptomics data are found at the website (Available online: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-25/). Metabolomics data are available at the website (Available online: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-108/). 3.8. Integrated Data Analysis MetaboAnalyst software (Available online: www.metaboanalyst.ca) was used for pathway and enrichment analysis of metabolomics data as well as integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets. Data were log-transformed and auto-scaled then subjected to various analytical modules within the software [64]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Exploratory Gene Association Networks (EGAN) [42] (Available online: akt.ucsf.edu/EGAN) were used to assess pathway activation based on changes in mRNA expression levels. Human Metabolite Database (HMDB) accession numbers were queried and names of genes associated with metabolites exhibiting significant changes in abundance were extracted manually. These genes were used to construct a subset list of genes that may be functionally significant, based on metabolite abundance changes, and this subset was also subjected to pathway and enrichment analysis. 3.9. Histology Fixed tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as described previously [65]. Histologic images were captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a 4mp Macrofire digital camera (Optronics, Tokyo, Japan) using the PictureFrame Application 2.3 (Optronics). All images were cropped and assembled using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). 3.10. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism V6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) using a Mann-Whitney U-test or unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction for comparison between groups. Means ± SEM were reported. The ROUT method with Q = 1% was used to identify outliers for exclusion from analysis. p (corr)-values less than 0.05 were selected to indicate significance.",
    "results": "2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Short Duration Exposure to the Space Environment Significantly Alters Hepatic Metabolite Profiles Previously, we selected specific genes and metabolites to interrogate from our large-scale-‘omics datasets to address defined hypotheses. Here, we performed unsupervised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using the entire metabolomics dataset to determine whether 13.5 days of exposure to the space environment was sufficient to induce significant changes in metabolism in livers of mice flown in space (FLT) as compared with matched ground controls (AEM). The scores plot of the PLS-DA analysis demonstrates clear separation between the FLT mice (green) and AEM controls (red) (Figure 1A). Volcano plot analysis (Figure 1B) shows that 10 biochemicals increased in FLT mice with a fold change (FC) greater than 2 and a p (corr)-value less than 0.05, while only 3 biochemicals decreased in the FLT mice as compared to the AEM controls (Table 1) from a total of 14 upregulated (FC > 2) and 11 downregulated (FC < 0.5) biochemicals (Figure S1A and Table S1). Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) analysis of the top 15 most important features contributing to the clustering is plotted in Figure S1B and the most significant features in the volcano plot also appear within the top 15 VIP features. Hierarchical clustering with organization of features by VIP score (Figure 1C) also shows clear separation of metabolite features between the two groups, with relatively fewer metabolites decreased in abundance in the FLT mice as compared with the AEM controls. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Brief exposure to the space environment results in significant metabolite changes in mouse liver.

Altered Betaine and Glutathione Metabolism Are Central Defects in Spaceflight Mouse Livers Metabolite set enrichment was performed in MetaboAnalyst using pathway-associated metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” (Figure 2). Enrichment was performed using either all metabolites (Figure 2A) or a more limited subset consisting only of those significantly changing in abundance (Figure 2B). Significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. A fold-change cutoff was not applied, therefore some of the significant metabolites differ from those identified in the volcano plot. When enrichment analysis was performed using all metabolites, relatively few p (corr)-values for enriched metabolite sets reached significance (p < 0.05). However, the top several sets (methionine metabolism, branched chain fatty acid oxidation, betaine metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism) were retained when the limited subset of metabolites was used for analysis (Figure 2B). Furthermore, enrichment of glutathione and glutamate metabolism, important components of the response to oxidative stress, rose to significance in the analysis of the limited dataset, suggesting the utility of performing the same analysis multiple times on different subsets of the data. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Metabolite set enrichment analysis reveals metabolic pathways enriched in livers of FLT mice. Enrichment analysis was performed in MetaboAnalyst using (A) all metabolites or (B) only metabolites with significantly changing abundances between groups (p < 0.05). n = 5/group. Eighty-eight metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” were used for the analysis. For clarity of presentation, only the most significantly enriched metabolite sets are annotated.We next identified specific metabolites that were contributing to the enrichment scores. The glycine, serine and threonine metabolism enrichment score was based on decrease of cystathionine and increase of betaine and dimethylglycine. Eight other metabolites contributed to the enrichment, however their abundance changes were not significant between groups. The glutathione metabolism enrichment score was based on decreased abundance of glutathione and cysteinylglycine in FLT mice as compared with AEM controls, with additional contributions from four non-significantly changing metabolites. Fatty acid oxidation enrichment scores (both branched chain and very long chain) were based on abundance of propionylcarnitine and carnitine, with coenzyme A and acetyl carnitine contributing to the score as well. It should be noted that MetaboAnalyst does not recognize many lipids, therefore lipid metabolic pathways are likely under-represented. Contributors to enrichment of methionine metabolism were similar to those of betaine metabolism and consisted primarily of betaine, dimethylglycine and choline, with additional contributions from S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, suggesting activation of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cycle in the FLT mice. Abundances of these metabolites in FLT mouse livers and AEM controls are summarized in Table S2. For validation, metabolite pathway analysis was performed and similar pathways were found to have a high impact score based on enrichment and topology analysis (Figure S2). We previously reported a significant increase in abundance of betaine in FLT livers [4,5]. Betaine is metabolized from choline, which decreased in FLT mice [4,5]. Betaine is also a methyl donor and provides the methyl group for metabolism of homocysteine to methionine, generating dimethylglycine as well. Furthermore, the transmethylation cycle provides substrates used for the synthesis of cystathionine and GSH via transsulferation [23]; labile methyl groups are required for these processes as well as support of folate metabolism and synthesis of methylated compounds. Since methionine is lost in the transmethylation pathway, it is possible that choline is supplied to preserve pathway function [24]. However, the observed increase in abundance of betaine with a concomitant decrease in cystathionine and GSH suggests increased choline metabolism in spaceflight is not linked to augmented activation of one carbon metabolic pathways, since abundance levels of relevant metabolites such as S-adenosylhomocysteine, serine, sarcosine and glycine are unchanged. Therefore, other mechanisms are likely involved. Dietary choline and methionine induce lipotrophic effects through upregulation of very low-density lipoprotein export and fatty acid oxidation, and choline deficiency has been associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and steatosis. Shown in Figure 3, histological assessment confirms that spaceflight indeed results in increased presence of inflammatory cells as well as augmented steatosis. Although we previously measured upregulation of mRNA expression levels of PPAR-α, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation, it is likely that PPAR activation is mediated through increased retinol abundance instead of elevated choline [5]. Choline may be replenished by recycling from phosphatidylcholine, which may impair integrity of lipid membranes. Metabolomics analysis of choline-containing lysolipids revealed an average 40% decrease in abundance of these lipids in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls, although differences between groups were not significant for individual features (Figure S3). These results suggest that augmented metabolism of betaine, in excess of what is needed for methionine metabolism, may lead to injurious choline deficits in spaceflight mice. Whether this is causally related to decreased glutathione and the ability to respond to oxidative stress remains an open question. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Increased steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight. H&E staining was performed on fixed liver sections from n = 4–5 mice/group to investigate liver histology. Inspection of the H&E stained sections revealed that the AEM ground control mice had small cytoplasmic lipid droplets predominantly located in zone 2 whereas the FLT mice had an increase in slightly larger droplets distributed in a panlobular pattern. Multiple lipid droplets are indicated using white arrows. Furthermore, FLT mice showed increased accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly near portal ducts (yellow arrow). Representative images are shown from each group. PT = portal triad, CV = central vein. Scale bar = 100 μm.Notably, betaine serves as an organic osmolyte, protecting cells from effects of dehydration. Water intake in FLT mice was decreased by ~20% as compared to AEM controls, although food intake was unchanged (Table 2), therefore a likely cause for the upregulation of betaine is dehydration. We also measured upregulation of taurine, another osmolyte. Abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate was strikingly decreased (Figure S1A) and was the most important feature contributing to the clustering of groups in the PLS-DA analysis (Figure S1B). Guanidino compounds are metabolized from arginine, and dehydration modifies abundance of these compounds in the kidney [25]. Kidney injury not only results in reduced arginine synthesis but change in levels of guanidino compounds and their metabolism in muscles and liver [26]. The marked decrease in abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate may therefore be associated with dehydration in the FLT mice. Many of the most striking changes in metabolite and transcript abundances appeared to be related to increased dehydration of the FLT mice as compared to AEM controls; although this is a possible limitation of the study, a recent proteomics study on livers from male mice in the “Bion-M1” study flown in space for 30 days and re-acclimated showed results similar to those from our previously published data [22]. Therefore, either the Bion-M1 mice were also dehydrated, or the enriched pathways that we measured indeed have functional significance, potentially related to a shift in metabolic requirements due to unloading. Taken together, the data suggest that dehydration, coupled with oxidative stress, combine to deplete choline stores, leading to impaired lipid membrane metabolism and contributing to increased steatosis in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight.

Spaceflight Causes Broad Alterations in Transcriptome Profiles in the Liver To understand the role of transcriptional regulation in the observed alterations to metabolites, we performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptome datasets obtained with Affymetrix Genechip 1.0 ST arrays using GeneSpring software. We found significant alterations (p (corr) < 0.05) in 3005 out of 28,852 genes, or approximately 10% of identifiable probesets (Figure 4A,C). Of these, 601 genes were found to have biological significance; expression levels of 449 genes were upregulated (FC > 1.5) and 152, downregulated (FC < −1.5) (Figure 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Hepatic gene expression is significantly altered by exposure to the space environment. Profile (A) and scatter (C) plots of all significantly regulated genes (p (corr) < 0.05), and (B) profile plots of biologically significant genes with differential regulation FC +/− 1.5. Red lines (B) and points (C) indicate significantly upregulated genes in AEM mice, whilst blue indicate significantly upregulated genes in FLT. Yellow indicates genes that are statistically but not biologically significant.Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) biological functions (Figure 5) revealed that most upregulated genes were involved in metabolism or basic cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and DNA repair. Of note, several autophagy-related genes were altered as were genes involved in oxidative stress and regulation of peroxisomes, in particular fatty acid synthesis and degradation (Figure 5A). Our previous studies found significant alterations in both mRNA and metabolites associated with activation of PPAR-mediated pathways, as well as alterations in fatty acid oxidation in response to spaceflight [4,5]. Furthermore, as peroxisomes catalyze redox reactions and are potential regulators of oxidative stress-mediating signaling pathways, it is possible that peroxisomes and mitochondria may cooperate to determine cell fate decisions [27]. Specifically, peroxisomes house several enzymes that can produce or degrade ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and therefore may act as modulators of oxidative balance [28,29,30]. Recent studies have shown that disturbances in peroxisomal metabolism play a role in the accumulation of cellular damage due to oxidative stress and therefore, cellular aging. There is also evidence that peroxisomes can act as upstream initiators of mitochondrial ROS signaling pathways [31]. However, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are yet to be fully elucidated. Figure 5. Open in a new tab GO biological functions associated with (A) up- and (B) downregulated datasets. Change in regulation was determined as the ratio of average expression of FLT to AEM values for each transcript, n = 6/group.GO analysis of downregulated datasets denoted alterations in the regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and cell signaling (Figure 5B). Several processes related to activation and regulation of the inflammatory response/immunity were also downregulated. Previous studies have shown significant deficits in immunity in response to spaceflight, including suppression of proliferation and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cell lineages [32,33], as well as shifts in immune cell phenotypes characterized by increased numbers of bone marrow-derived T cells and decreased bone marrow-derived B cell populations [34]. Furthermore, studies using cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ bone marrow progenitor cells revealed decreases in total cell number in microgravity samples, and additionally decreased erythropoiesis with concomitant increased macrophage differentiation [35]. 2.4. Pathways Involved in Lipid Membrane Metabolism and Protein Biosynthesis Are Enriched in Multi-‘Omics Datasets from Livers of Spaceflight Mice To further validate our metabolomics results, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets using the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Analysis function. This algorithm performs an enrichment analysis to determine whether the observed genes and metabolites in a given pathway appear more often than expected by random chance within the dataset. An additional topology analysis evaluates whether a given gene or metabolite plays an important role in a biological response based on its position within a pathway. An over-representation analysis based on hypergeometric testing using 17,403 genes and 247 metabolites was used for the enrichment analysis and topology was assessed with “Betweenness Centrality”, which measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others passing through a given node within the pathway. Integrated analysis of both genes and metabolites (Figure 6A) confirmed the impact of spaceflight on lipid membrane metabolism. Eight of the top 20 enriched pathways relate to lipid membrane metabolism (including glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism). Previously, we reported that Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed endocytosis as an enriched gene pathway [4], which was also the most highly enriched pathway in the gene-centric analysis (Figure 6B). Enrichment of inflammatory pathways was also evident by the presence of multiple pathways related to cancer. Supporting our other metabolite set enrichment analysis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism had high enrichment and topology scores in the metabolite-centric analytical workflow (Figure 6C). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Integrated enrichment analysis using multi-‘omics datasets from livers of spaceflight mice compared with AEM ground controls. Data were submitted to the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Pathway Analysis module. (A) gene-metabolite; (B) gene and (C) metabolite centric workflows were compared for n = 6 mice per group.Interestingly, several studies have shown that peroxisomes may alter lipid production and concentration in response to changes in metabolism, mediating cellular signaling through sphingolipids. In our analyses, we observed enrichment of sphingolipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism, as well as alterations in peroxisome gene expression levels, suggesting that spaceflight may alter peroxisome-related signaling pathways, including sphingolipids, to regulate cellular processes [36]. Sphingolipids, specifically, are important messengers for signaling events resulting in activation of cellular proliferation, differentiation or senescence [27,36]. Furthermore, sphingolipids have been linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential role of sphingolipids in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [37]. These results therefore indicate a potential connection between peroxisome redox metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress mediated by sphingolipid signaling pathways and resulting in upregulation of inflammatory/stress-related signaling, such as NF-κB. Of note, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis emerged as the top enriched metabolite pathway in the metabolite-centric analysis which, when taken together with enrichment of purine metabolism in the gene-metabolite centric analysis, suggested that spaceflight may increase biosynthesis or even post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs, the building blocks of mRNA decoding and protein translation. Post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs critically influences tRNA functions such as folding, stability and decoding [38,39]. Defects in tRNA modifications and modification enzymes are associated with oxidative stress [40] and human diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiomyopathy [38]. Indeed, results from a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans associating defects in post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs with dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation suggest that the cell's maladaptive response to hypomodified mitochondrial tRNAs may be a mechanism underlying disease development [41]. Although speculative, the idea that exposure to the space environment may lead to aberrant tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is provocative and warrants further investigation. Since MetaboAnalyst preferentially utilizes metabolic pathways for enrichment analyses, we further interrogated the transcriptomic dataset using EGAN (Exploratory Gene Association Networks) to confirm importance of enriched pathways [42]. We performed an association analysis using all transcripts significantly changing between groups (Figure 7). Three main clusters emerged. The first cluster focused on nucleic acid metabolism and included purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Purine metabolism enrichment was dominated by strong upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4D (Pde4d, Table 3), an enzyme with 3′,5′-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase activity that degrades cAMP, an important second messenger mediating signaling in multiple pathways. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (Ampd2, Table 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and maintains cellular guanine nucleotide pools [43], was downregulated, potentially attenuating protein synthesis. This protein also mediates gluconeogenesis in the rodent liver [44] and, together with Pde4d upregulation (Table 3), suggests pathways impacting cellular quiescence may be altered by spaceflight. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Cluster analysis using EGAN (Exploratory Gene Association Networks) software was performed using all significantly changing transcripts (p < 0.05). Genes associated with the top enriched pathways were clustered using a radial force-driven display. Insets are zoomed out views of each cluster. Only significantly changing genes are included in insets for clarity of presentation.

Specifically, exposure of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to spaceflight following addition of osteogenic differentiation factors resulted in increased expression of genes related to neural development, neural morphogenesis and transmission of nerve impulses and synapses in studies conducted on the International Space Station [45]. This same study found increased expression of cell cycle arrest molecules indicating either increased differentiation of cells in space or activation of cellular quiescence or senescence [45]. Our previous studies have also found significant alterations in the proliferation and differentiation potential of both embryonic and bone marrow stem cells during 13–15 days of spaceflight, with upregulation of the cell cycle arrest and senescence marker cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN)1a/p21 [46,47,48,49]. Notably, analysis of our liver transcriptome dataset also found upregulation of CDKN1a/p21 (3.15 fold, p (corr) < 0.05, Table 3), as well as upregulation of INK4C/p18 with concomitant attenuation of cyclin gene expression (Figure S4). Similarly, GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using our whole transcriptome profile showed alterations in several pathways, including quiescent cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and activation of oxidative phosphorylation. When taken in total, these results suggest potential systemic induction of cellular senescence due to short-term exposure to the space environment. The second major cluster that emerged from our EGAN analysis was aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, supporting the MetaboAnalyst enrichment results, showing upregulation of expression of all genes within the cluster. Modifications regulate the turnover of RNAs, and improperly modified tRNAs are targeted for degradation [50], therefore it is possible that upregulation of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis actually targets cells for attenuation of protein translation due to hypomodifications or alterations of the epitranscriptome. Finally, we observed a third cluster of genes corresponding to enrichment of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as shown in Figure S5 and determined that the components of the 20S proteasome were significantly upregulated, supporting the observed pattern of molecular catabolism. Analysis of significantly upregulated datasets using GO analysis also indicated activation of catabolism, primarily in ATP-dependent and glycolytic pathways. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are the two main intracellular degradation pathways [51]. Autophagy primarily mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Since activation of the proteasome is associated with increased autophagy, we used BIOMART [52] to obtain a list of genes associated with autophagy GO terms and screened that list for expression changes using EGAN (Figure 8). We found significant upregulation in expression of a number of genes, including Atg2a, important for autophagosome formation as well as regulation of lipid droplet morphology and dispersion; microtubule-associated genes (Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b); Wipi1 and 2, involved in pre-autophagosome formation and the autophagy response to starvation; and Mtor, a central mediator of cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, supporting our GSEA results (Table 3). Alterations in the rate of autophagy have been shown to regulate ROS formation and redox balance under specific circumstances [53]. However, proteins damaged by ROS/RNS form protein aggregates that are degraded through the 20S proteasome in order to maintain cellular homeostasis [53]. Exposure to chronic or sustained oxidative stress can lead to inactivation of the proteasome, resulting in accumulation of protein conjugates. Heavily oxidized protein aggregates are also not suitable for degradation by the proteasome [54]. These aggregates may be specific targets of autophagy-related pathways mediated by heat shock protein chaperones, which were also altered in our analyses (Table 3). These results suggest that spaceflight leads to upregulation of multiple autophagy-related pathways and are consistent with activation of the proteasome and attenuation of protein synthesis in livers from FLT mice as compared with AEM controls. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Autophagy programs are upregulated in livers from spaceflight mice. Cluster analysis using EGAN software was performed using genes associated with autophagy programs generated by BIOMART. Genes were clustered using a radial force-driven display. Intensity of color (red = upregulated, green = downregulated, grey = not detected) is associated with degree of fold change and width of the bounding circle is inversely related to p (corr)-value. n = 6 animals per group were used for the analysis.Finally, we sought to determine whether decreased response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of autophagy and we performed a pathway analysis of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2)-mediated response to oxidative stress (Figure 9). We found significant downregulation of Nrf2 expression levels in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls (Table 3), as well as diminished expression of downstream pathway members, suggesting that exposure to the space environment leads to attenuation of oxidative defense. Notably, spaceflight studies using mice flown on STS-131 for 15 days also revealed downregulation of this oxidative stress mitigator in bone marrow tissues [46,47]. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient sample to directly probe for changes in protein oxidation, although oxidative damage is a likely cause for the observed increase in autophagy programs and upregulation of the proteasome in the FLT mice. Figure 9. Open in a new tab NFE2L2/NRF2-mediated pathways are downregulated in spaceflight mouse livers. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for analysis of mRNA transcript levels in livers from FLT and AEM control mice. Grey = unchanged, green = downregulated, red = upregulated. Intensity of color correlates with degree of fold-change. n = 6/group.Autophagy-related programs are essential for liver regeneration [55] and repair and induction of autophagy may occur in response to exposure to the space environment. Several studies have characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration of the liver in response to a variety of stress conditions and in response to partial hepatectomy (PHx), whereby a significant portion of the rodent liver is removed and the remaining portion regenerates and restores the liver to its original size. This process is highly regulated and includes several distinct stages, including withdrawal of hepatocytes from quiescence, cell cycle entry and progression, cessation of cell division and return of hepatocytes to quiescence [56,57,58,59]. Although hepatocytes are the first cells to replicate, they are followed sequentially by other cell types within the liver including stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells [59]. A recent study demonstrated that autophagy is critical in the prevention of hepatocyte senescence during the early stages of liver regeneration, and inhibition of autophagy-related genes results in delayed liver regeneration, aggregation of unfolded proteins, and activation of senescence in hepatocytes with a corresponding increase in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related molecules [58]. This also coincides with considerable damage to the mitochondria, reduced β-oxidation and reduced intrahepatic ATP generation, leading to dysregulation of hepatocellular lipid stores [58]. As we found mild upregulation of autophagy-related genes as well as upregulation of senescence, it is possible that autophagy pathways were initially activated to degrade oxidized proteins. However, as chronic oxidative stress has been shown to induce hepatocyte senescence, it is likely that senescence signaling pathways were activated in response to accumulation of oxidized proteins and failure of autophagy mechanisms to clear these proteins. Indeed, other studies have also demonstrated links between increased oxidative stress and increased hepatocyte senescence, resulting in steatosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction [60,61,62]. This senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is a regulated process driven by signaling through p21 and through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which we found to be upregulated in the current study (Table 3). Such changes are very similar to those that occur during ageing and obesity-related pathologies, such as insulin resistance, and have been associated with impaired energy generation and increased production of ROS. Studies conducted by us and others have shown spaceflight leads to increased oxidative stress, increased insulin resistance, and systemic induction of aging-related pathologies. It is possible that in the liver, increased oxidative stress and altered autophagy pathways may cause hepatocyte senescence through activation of p21 and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in hepatic steatosis (as we previously reported [5]) and impaired regenerative capacity. These molecular changes may have important implications for the onset of obesity-related diseases and regenerative health in the course of long-duration space exploration.",
    "discussion": "2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Short Duration Exposure to the Space Environment Significantly Alters Hepatic Metabolite Profiles Previously, we selected specific genes and metabolites to interrogate from our large-scale-‘omics datasets to address defined hypotheses. Here, we performed unsupervised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using the entire metabolomics dataset to determine whether 13.5 days of exposure to the space environment was sufficient to induce significant changes in metabolism in livers of mice flown in space (FLT) as compared with matched ground controls (AEM). The scores plot of the PLS-DA analysis demonstrates clear separation between the FLT mice (green) and AEM controls (red) (Figure 1A). Volcano plot analysis (Figure 1B) shows that 10 biochemicals increased in FLT mice with a fold change (FC) greater than 2 and a p (corr)-value less than 0.05, while only 3 biochemicals decreased in the FLT mice as compared to the AEM controls (Table 1) from a total of 14 upregulated (FC > 2) and 11 downregulated (FC < 0.5) biochemicals (Figure S1A and Table S1). Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) analysis of the top 15 most important features contributing to the clustering is plotted in Figure S1B and the most significant features in the volcano plot also appear within the top 15 VIP features. Hierarchical clustering with organization of features by VIP score (Figure 1C) also shows clear separation of metabolite features between the two groups, with relatively fewer metabolites decreased in abundance in the FLT mice as compared with the AEM controls. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Brief exposure to the space environment results in significant metabolite changes in mouse liver.

Altered Betaine and Glutathione Metabolism Are Central Defects in Spaceflight Mouse Livers Metabolite set enrichment was performed in MetaboAnalyst using pathway-associated metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” (Figure 2). Enrichment was performed using either all metabolites (Figure 2A) or a more limited subset consisting only of those significantly changing in abundance (Figure 2B). Significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. A fold-change cutoff was not applied, therefore some of the significant metabolites differ from those identified in the volcano plot. When enrichment analysis was performed using all metabolites, relatively few p (corr)-values for enriched metabolite sets reached significance (p < 0.05). However, the top several sets (methionine metabolism, branched chain fatty acid oxidation, betaine metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism) were retained when the limited subset of metabolites was used for analysis (Figure 2B). Furthermore, enrichment of glutathione and glutamate metabolism, important components of the response to oxidative stress, rose to significance in the analysis of the limited dataset, suggesting the utility of performing the same analysis multiple times on different subsets of the data. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Metabolite set enrichment analysis reveals metabolic pathways enriched in livers of FLT mice. Enrichment analysis was performed in MetaboAnalyst using (A) all metabolites or (B) only metabolites with significantly changing abundances between groups (p < 0.05). n = 5/group. Eighty-eight metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” were used for the analysis. For clarity of presentation, only the most significantly enriched metabolite sets are annotated.We next identified specific metabolites that were contributing to the enrichment scores. The glycine, serine and threonine metabolism enrichment score was based on decrease of cystathionine and increase of betaine and dimethylglycine. Eight other metabolites contributed to the enrichment, however their abundance changes were not significant between groups. The glutathione metabolism enrichment score was based on decreased abundance of glutathione and cysteinylglycine in FLT mice as compared with AEM controls, with additional contributions from four non-significantly changing metabolites. Fatty acid oxidation enrichment scores (both branched chain and very long chain) were based on abundance of propionylcarnitine and carnitine, with coenzyme A and acetyl carnitine contributing to the score as well. It should be noted that MetaboAnalyst does not recognize many lipids, therefore lipid metabolic pathways are likely under-represented. Contributors to enrichment of methionine metabolism were similar to those of betaine metabolism and consisted primarily of betaine, dimethylglycine and choline, with additional contributions from S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, suggesting activation of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cycle in the FLT mice. Abundances of these metabolites in FLT mouse livers and AEM controls are summarized in Table S2. For validation, metabolite pathway analysis was performed and similar pathways were found to have a high impact score based on enrichment and topology analysis (Figure S2). We previously reported a significant increase in abundance of betaine in FLT livers [4,5]. Betaine is metabolized from choline, which decreased in FLT mice [4,5]. Betaine is also a methyl donor and provides the methyl group for metabolism of homocysteine to methionine, generating dimethylglycine as well. Furthermore, the transmethylation cycle provides substrates used for the synthesis of cystathionine and GSH via transsulferation [23]; labile methyl groups are required for these processes as well as support of folate metabolism and synthesis of methylated compounds. Since methionine is lost in the transmethylation pathway, it is possible that choline is supplied to preserve pathway function [24]. However, the observed increase in abundance of betaine with a concomitant decrease in cystathionine and GSH suggests increased choline metabolism in spaceflight is not linked to augmented activation of one carbon metabolic pathways, since abundance levels of relevant metabolites such as S-adenosylhomocysteine, serine, sarcosine and glycine are unchanged. Therefore, other mechanisms are likely involved. Dietary choline and methionine induce lipotrophic effects through upregulation of very low-density lipoprotein export and fatty acid oxidation, and choline deficiency has been associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and steatosis. Shown in Figure 3, histological assessment confirms that spaceflight indeed results in increased presence of inflammatory cells as well as augmented steatosis. Although we previously measured upregulation of mRNA expression levels of PPAR-α, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation, it is likely that PPAR activation is mediated through increased retinol abundance instead of elevated choline [5]. Choline may be replenished by recycling from phosphatidylcholine, which may impair integrity of lipid membranes. Metabolomics analysis of choline-containing lysolipids revealed an average 40% decrease in abundance of these lipids in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls, although differences between groups were not significant for individual features (Figure S3). These results suggest that augmented metabolism of betaine, in excess of what is needed for methionine metabolism, may lead to injurious choline deficits in spaceflight mice. Whether this is causally related to decreased glutathione and the ability to respond to oxidative stress remains an open question. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Increased steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight. H&E staining was performed on fixed liver sections from n = 4–5 mice/group to investigate liver histology. Inspection of the H&E stained sections revealed that the AEM ground control mice had small cytoplasmic lipid droplets predominantly located in zone 2 whereas the FLT mice had an increase in slightly larger droplets distributed in a panlobular pattern. Multiple lipid droplets are indicated using white arrows. Furthermore, FLT mice showed increased accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly near portal ducts (yellow arrow). Representative images are shown from each group. PT = portal triad, CV = central vein. Scale bar = 100 μm.Notably, betaine serves as an organic osmolyte, protecting cells from effects of dehydration. Water intake in FLT mice was decreased by ~20% as compared to AEM controls, although food intake was unchanged (Table 2), therefore a likely cause for the upregulation of betaine is dehydration. We also measured upregulation of taurine, another osmolyte. Abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate was strikingly decreased (Figure S1A) and was the most important feature contributing to the clustering of groups in the PLS-DA analysis (Figure S1B). Guanidino compounds are metabolized from arginine, and dehydration modifies abundance of these compounds in the kidney [25]. Kidney injury not only results in reduced arginine synthesis but change in levels of guanidino compounds and their metabolism in muscles and liver [26]. The marked decrease in abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate may therefore be associated with dehydration in the FLT mice. Many of the most striking changes in metabolite and transcript abundances appeared to be related to increased dehydration of the FLT mice as compared to AEM controls; although this is a possible limitation of the study, a recent proteomics study on livers from male mice in the “Bion-M1” study flown in space for 30 days and re-acclimated showed results similar to those from our previously published data [22]. Therefore, either the Bion-M1 mice were also dehydrated, or the enriched pathways that we measured indeed have functional significance, potentially related to a shift in metabolic requirements due to unloading. Taken together, the data suggest that dehydration, coupled with oxidative stress, combine to deplete choline stores, leading to impaired lipid membrane metabolism and contributing to increased steatosis in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight.

Spaceflight Causes Broad Alterations in Transcriptome Profiles in the Liver To understand the role of transcriptional regulation in the observed alterations to metabolites, we performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptome datasets obtained with Affymetrix Genechip 1.0 ST arrays using GeneSpring software. We found significant alterations (p (corr) < 0.05) in 3005 out of 28,852 genes, or approximately 10% of identifiable probesets (Figure 4A,C). Of these, 601 genes were found to have biological significance; expression levels of 449 genes were upregulated (FC > 1.5) and 152, downregulated (FC < −1.5) (Figure 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Hepatic gene expression is significantly altered by exposure to the space environment. Profile (A) and scatter (C) plots of all significantly regulated genes (p (corr) < 0.05), and (B) profile plots of biologically significant genes with differential regulation FC +/− 1.5. Red lines (B) and points (C) indicate significantly upregulated genes in AEM mice, whilst blue indicate significantly upregulated genes in FLT. Yellow indicates genes that are statistically but not biologically significant.Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) biological functions (Figure 5) revealed that most upregulated genes were involved in metabolism or basic cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and DNA repair. Of note, several autophagy-related genes were altered as were genes involved in oxidative stress and regulation of peroxisomes, in particular fatty acid synthesis and degradation (Figure 5A). Our previous studies found significant alterations in both mRNA and metabolites associated with activation of PPAR-mediated pathways, as well as alterations in fatty acid oxidation in response to spaceflight [4,5]. Furthermore, as peroxisomes catalyze redox reactions and are potential regulators of oxidative stress-mediating signaling pathways, it is possible that peroxisomes and mitochondria may cooperate to determine cell fate decisions [27]. Specifically, peroxisomes house several enzymes that can produce or degrade ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and therefore may act as modulators of oxidative balance [28,29,30]. Recent studies have shown that disturbances in peroxisomal metabolism play a role in the accumulation of cellular damage due to oxidative stress and therefore, cellular aging. There is also evidence that peroxisomes can act as upstream initiators of mitochondrial ROS signaling pathways [31]. However, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are yet to be fully elucidated. Figure 5. Open in a new tab GO biological functions associated with (A) up- and (B) downregulated datasets. Change in regulation was determined as the ratio of average expression of FLT to AEM values for each transcript, n = 6/group.GO analysis of downregulated datasets denoted alterations in the regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and cell signaling (Figure 5B). Several processes related to activation and regulation of the inflammatory response/immunity were also downregulated. Previous studies have shown significant deficits in immunity in response to spaceflight, including suppression of proliferation and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cell lineages [32,33], as well as shifts in immune cell phenotypes characterized by increased numbers of bone marrow-derived T cells and decreased bone marrow-derived B cell populations [34]. Furthermore, studies using cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ bone marrow progenitor cells revealed decreases in total cell number in microgravity samples, and additionally decreased erythropoiesis with concomitant increased macrophage differentiation [35]. 2.4. Pathways Involved in Lipid Membrane Metabolism and Protein Biosynthesis Are Enriched in Multi-‘Omics Datasets from Livers of Spaceflight Mice To further validate our metabolomics results, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets using the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Analysis function. This algorithm performs an enrichment analysis to determine whether the observed genes and metabolites in a given pathway appear more often than expected by random chance within the dataset. An additional topology analysis evaluates whether a given gene or metabolite plays an important role in a biological response based on its position within a pathway. An over-representation analysis based on hypergeometric testing using 17,403 genes and 247 metabolites was used for the enrichment analysis and topology was assessed with “Betweenness Centrality”, which measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others passing through a given node within the pathway. Integrated analysis of both genes and metabolites (Figure 6A) confirmed the impact of spaceflight on lipid membrane metabolism. Eight of the top 20 enriched pathways relate to lipid membrane metabolism (including glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism). Previously, we reported that Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed endocytosis as an enriched gene pathway [4], which was also the most highly enriched pathway in the gene-centric analysis (Figure 6B). Enrichment of inflammatory pathways was also evident by the presence of multiple pathways related to cancer. Supporting our other metabolite set enrichment analysis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism had high enrichment and topology scores in the metabolite-centric analytical workflow (Figure 6C). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Integrated enrichment analysis using multi-‘omics datasets from livers of spaceflight mice compared with AEM ground controls. Data were submitted to the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Pathway Analysis module. (A) gene-metabolite; (B) gene and (C) metabolite centric workflows were compared for n = 6 mice per group.Interestingly, several studies have shown that peroxisomes may alter lipid production and concentration in response to changes in metabolism, mediating cellular signaling through sphingolipids. In our analyses, we observed enrichment of sphingolipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism, as well as alterations in peroxisome gene expression levels, suggesting that spaceflight may alter peroxisome-related signaling pathways, including sphingolipids, to regulate cellular processes [36]. Sphingolipids, specifically, are important messengers for signaling events resulting in activation of cellular proliferation, differentiation or senescence [27,36]. Furthermore, sphingolipids have been linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential role of sphingolipids in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [37]. These results therefore indicate a potential connection between peroxisome redox metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress mediated by sphingolipid signaling pathways and resulting in upregulation of inflammatory/stress-related signaling, such as NF-κB. Of note, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis emerged as the top enriched metabolite pathway in the metabolite-centric analysis which, when taken together with enrichment of purine metabolism in the gene-metabolite centric analysis, suggested that spaceflight may increase biosynthesis or even post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs, the building blocks of mRNA decoding and protein translation. Post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs critically influences tRNA functions such as folding, stability and decoding [38,39]. Defects in tRNA modifications and modification enzymes are associated with oxidative stress [40] and human diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiomyopathy [38]. Indeed, results from a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans associating defects in post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs with dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation suggest that the cell's maladaptive response to hypomodified mitochondrial tRNAs may be a mechanism underlying disease development [41]. Although speculative, the idea that exposure to the space environment may lead to aberrant tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is provocative and warrants further investigation. Since MetaboAnalyst preferentially utilizes metabolic pathways for enrichment analyses, we further interrogated the transcriptomic dataset using EGAN (Exploratory Gene Association Networks) to confirm importance of enriched pathways [42]. We performed an association analysis using all transcripts significantly changing between groups (Figure 7). Three main clusters emerged. The first cluster focused on nucleic acid metabolism and included purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Purine metabolism enrichment was dominated by strong upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4D (Pde4d, Table 3), an enzyme with 3′,5′-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase activity that degrades cAMP, an important second messenger mediating signaling in multiple pathways. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (Ampd2, Table 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and maintains cellular guanine nucleotide pools [43], was downregulated, potentially attenuating protein synthesis. This protein also mediates gluconeogenesis in the rodent liver [44] and, together with Pde4d upregulation (Table 3), suggests pathways impacting cellular quiescence may be altered by spaceflight.

Specifically, exposure of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to spaceflight following addition of osteogenic differentiation factors resulted in increased expression of genes related to neural development, neural morphogenesis and transmission of nerve impulses and synapses in studies conducted on the International Space Station [45]. This same study found increased expression of cell cycle arrest molecules indicating either increased differentiation of cells in space or activation of cellular quiescence or senescence [45]. Our previous studies have also found significant alterations in the proliferation and differentiation potential of both embryonic and bone marrow stem cells during 13–15 days of spaceflight, with upregulation of the cell cycle arrest and senescence marker cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN)1a/p21 [46,47,48,49]. Notably, analysis of our liver transcriptome dataset also found upregulation of CDKN1a/p21 (3.15 fold, p (corr) < 0.05, Table 3), as well as upregulation of INK4C/p18 with concomitant attenuation of cyclin gene expression (Figure S4). Similarly, GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using our whole transcriptome profile showed alterations in several pathways, including quiescent cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and activation of oxidative phosphorylation. When taken in total, these results suggest potential systemic induction of cellular senescence due to short-term exposure to the space environment. The second major cluster that emerged from our EGAN analysis was aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, supporting the MetaboAnalyst enrichment results, showing upregulation of expression of all genes within the cluster. Modifications regulate the turnover of RNAs, and improperly modified tRNAs are targeted for degradation [50], therefore it is possible that upregulation of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis actually targets cells for attenuation of protein translation due to hypomodifications or alterations of the epitranscriptome. Finally, we observed a third cluster of genes corresponding to enrichment of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as shown in Figure S5 and determined that the components of the 20S proteasome were significantly upregulated, supporting the observed pattern of molecular catabolism. Analysis of significantly upregulated datasets using GO analysis also indicated activation of catabolism, primarily in ATP-dependent and glycolytic pathways. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are the two main intracellular degradation pathways [51]. Autophagy primarily mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Since activation of the proteasome is associated with increased autophagy, we used BIOMART [52] to obtain a list of genes associated with autophagy GO terms and screened that list for expression changes using EGAN (Figure 8). We found significant upregulation in expression of a number of genes, including Atg2a, important for autophagosome formation as well as regulation of lipid droplet morphology and dispersion; microtubule-associated genes (Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b); Wipi1 and 2, involved in pre-autophagosome formation and the autophagy response to starvation; and Mtor, a central mediator of cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, supporting our GSEA results (Table 3). Alterations in the rate of autophagy have been shown to regulate ROS formation and redox balance under specific circumstances [53]. However, proteins damaged by ROS/RNS form protein aggregates that are degraded through the 20S proteasome in order to maintain cellular homeostasis [53]. Exposure to chronic or sustained oxidative stress can lead to inactivation of the proteasome, resulting in accumulation of protein conjugates. Heavily oxidized protein aggregates are also not suitable for degradation by the proteasome [54]. These aggregates may be specific targets of autophagy-related pathways mediated by heat shock protein chaperones, which were also altered in our analyses (Table 3). These results suggest that spaceflight leads to upregulation of multiple autophagy-related pathways and are consistent with activation of the proteasome and attenuation of protein synthesis in livers from FLT mice as compared with AEM controls. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Autophagy programs are upregulated in livers from spaceflight mice. Cluster analysis using EGAN software was performed using genes associated with autophagy programs generated by BIOMART. Genes were clustered using a radial force-driven display. Intensity of color (red = upregulated, green = downregulated, grey = not detected) is associated with degree of fold change and width of the bounding circle is inversely related to p (corr)-value. n = 6 animals per group were used for the analysis.Finally, we sought to determine whether decreased response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of autophagy and we performed a pathway analysis of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2)-mediated response to oxidative stress (Figure 9). We found significant downregulation of Nrf2 expression levels in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls (Table 3), as well as diminished expression of downstream pathway members, suggesting that exposure to the space environment leads to attenuation of oxidative defense. Notably, spaceflight studies using mice flown on STS-131 for 15 days also revealed downregulation of this oxidative stress mitigator in bone marrow tissues [46,47]. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient sample to directly probe for changes in protein oxidation, although oxidative damage is a likely cause for the observed increase in autophagy programs and upregulation of the proteasome in the FLT mice. Figure 9. Open in a new tab NFE2L2/NRF2-mediated pathways are downregulated in spaceflight mouse livers. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for analysis of mRNA transcript levels in livers from FLT and AEM control mice. Grey = unchanged, green = downregulated, red = upregulated. Intensity of color correlates with degree of fold-change. n = 6/group.Autophagy-related programs are essential for liver regeneration [55] and repair and induction of autophagy may occur in response to exposure to the space environment. Several studies have characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration of the liver in response to a variety of stress conditions and in response to partial hepatectomy (PHx), whereby a significant portion of the rodent liver is removed and the remaining portion regenerates and restores the liver to its original size. This process is highly regulated and includes several distinct stages, including withdrawal of hepatocytes from quiescence, cell cycle entry and progression, cessation of cell division and return of hepatocytes to quiescence [56,57,58,59]. Although hepatocytes are the first cells to replicate, they are followed sequentially by other cell types within the liver including stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells [59]. A recent study demonstrated that autophagy is critical in the prevention of hepatocyte senescence during the early stages of liver regeneration, and inhibition of autophagy-related genes results in delayed liver regeneration, aggregation of unfolded proteins, and activation of senescence in hepatocytes with a corresponding increase in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related molecules [58]. This also coincides with considerable damage to the mitochondria, reduced β-oxidation and reduced intrahepatic ATP generation, leading to dysregulation of hepatocellular lipid stores [58]. As we found mild upregulation of autophagy-related genes as well as upregulation of senescence, it is possible that autophagy pathways were initially activated to degrade oxidized proteins. However, as chronic oxidative stress has been shown to induce hepatocyte senescence, it is likely that senescence signaling pathways were activated in response to accumulation of oxidized proteins and failure of autophagy mechanisms to clear these proteins. Indeed, other studies have also demonstrated links between increased oxidative stress and increased hepatocyte senescence, resulting in steatosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction [60,61,62]. This senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is a regulated process driven by signaling through p21 and through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which we found to be upregulated in the current study (Table 3). Such changes are very similar to those that occur during ageing and obesity-related pathologies, such as insulin resistance, and have been associated with impaired energy generation and increased production of ROS. Studies conducted by us and others have shown spaceflight leads to increased oxidative stress, increased insulin resistance, and systemic induction of aging-related pathologies. It is possible that in the liver, increased oxidative stress and altered autophagy pathways may cause hepatocyte senescence through activation of p21 and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in hepatic steatosis (as we previously reported [5]) and impaired regenerative capacity. These molecular changes may have important implications for the onset of obesity-related diseases and regenerative health in the course of long-duration space exploration.",
    "conclusion": "4. Conclusions The unbiased analyses presented here both support our previous results and extend them to show that exposure to the space environment for only 13.5 days results in increased oxidative stress due to elevated ROS and impaired oxidative defense (by way of attenuation of NRF2-related pathways) in the mouse liver. Furthermore, our multi-‘omics studies suggest that accumulation of oxidized proteins coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to activation of hepatocyte senescence, resulting in hepatocyte lipid accumulation and steatosis. Further investigation into the potential for liver damage in the course of long-duration space exploration is needed, as are development of effective countermeasures to protect astronaut health.",

Copyright notice ID: 5666744 PMID: 28953266 Abstract Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment. Keywords: spaceflight, autophagy, proteasome, metabolomics, tRNA biosynthesis, senescence1. Introduction Long-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13]. Excessive ROS production, without a corresponding upregulation in antioxidant or ROS scavenger pathways, can cause damage to cellular components including DNA, proteins and lipids, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway [14]. This can lead to cell cycle arrest, activation of senescence or apoptosis and upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules, causing widespread organelle, cell and tissue damage [15]. Under conditions of chronic exposure to oxidative stress (such as in spaceflight), an imbalance occurs between ROS production and antioxidant quenching resulting in increased cellular and tissue damage [16,17,18]. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to damage by excess ROS and we hypothesized that the liver, a mitochondria-rich metabolic organ, may be a target of spaceflight-induced deficits. In support of this hypothesis, astronauts were shown to exhibit a mild diabetogenic phenotype following spaceflight, the severity of which was linked with flight duration [19,20]. We previously demonstrated that mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (Space Transportation System (STS)-135) for 13.5 days exhibited a significantly impaired response to oxidative stress evidenced by decreased hepatic levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH, reduced), with concomitant increased ophthalmate, a biomarker for depletion of glutathione, and increased ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG):GSH [21]. Other spaceflight-induced changes in hepatic genes linked to oxidative defense have also been observed [13]. Our targeted analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets obtained from livers of spaceflight mice showed dysregulation of pathways involved in both lipid metabolism and the immune response, with signs of retinoid export and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathways suggestive of nascent hepatic fat accretion and collagen deposition. Proteomics data acquired from mice exposed to space for 30 days exhibited similar patterns when compared with mice re-acclimated to ground conditions [22]. Our previous integrated data analysis utilized a limited set of genes and metabolites that were elevated in abundance in spaceflight mice as compared with ground controls and were tightly correlated with histological evidence of increased hepatic lipid accumulation. The goal of the present study was to perform unbiased, integrated analyses using the entire metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets to determine whether additional insights into the effects of exposure to the space environment on liver metabolism and cellular function could be gleaned. Utilizing several enrichment algorithms, we determined that degradation and senescence programs were altered in spaceflight mice in concert with attenuation of oxidative defense networks.2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Short Duration Exposure to the Space Environment Significantly Alters Hepatic Metabolite Profiles Previously, we selected specific genes and metabolites to interrogate from our large-scale-‘omics datasets to address defined hypotheses. Here, we performed unsupervised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using the entire metabolomics dataset to determine whether 13.5 days of exposure to the space environment was sufficient to induce significant changes in metabolism in livers of mice flown in space (FLT) as compared with matched ground controls (AEM). The scores plot of the PLS-DA analysis demonstrates clear separation between the FLT mice (green) and AEM controls (red) (Figure 1A). Volcano plot analysis (Figure 1B) shows that 10 biochemicals increased in FLT mice with a fold change (FC) greater than 2 and a p (corr)-value less than 0.05, while only 3 biochemicals decreased in the FLT mice as compared to the AEM controls (Table 1) from a total of 14 upregulated (FC > 2) and 11 downregulated (FC < 0.5) biochemicals (Figure S1A and Table S1). Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) analysis of the top 15 most important features contributing to the clustering is plotted in Figure S1B and the most significant features in the volcano plot also appear within the top 15 VIP features. Hierarchical clustering with organization of features by VIP score (Figure 1C) also shows clear separation of metabolite features between the two groups, with relatively fewer metabolites decreased in abundance in the FLT mice as compared with the AEM controls.

Altered Betaine and Glutathione Metabolism Are Central Defects in Spaceflight Mouse Livers Metabolite set enrichment was performed in MetaboAnalyst using pathway-associated metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” (Figure 2). Enrichment was performed using either all metabolites (Figure 2A) or a more limited subset consisting only of those significantly changing in abundance (Figure 2B). Significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. A fold-change cutoff was not applied, therefore some of the significant metabolites differ from those identified in the volcano plot. When enrichment analysis was performed using all metabolites, relatively few p (corr)-values for enriched metabolite sets reached significance (p < 0.05). However, the top several sets (methionine metabolism, branched chain fatty acid oxidation, betaine metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism) were retained when the limited subset of metabolites was used for analysis (Figure 2B). Furthermore, enrichment of glutathione and glutamate metabolism, important components of the response to oxidative stress, rose to significance in the analysis of the limited dataset, suggesting the utility of performing the same analysis multiple times on different subsets of the data. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Metabolite set enrichment analysis reveals metabolic pathways enriched in livers of FLT mice. Enrichment analysis was performed in MetaboAnalyst using (A) all metabolites or (B) only metabolites with significantly changing abundances between groups (p < 0.05). n = 5/group. Eighty-eight metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” were used for the analysis. For clarity of presentation, only the most significantly enriched metabolite sets are annotated.We next identified specific metabolites that were contributing to the enrichment scores. The glycine, serine and threonine metabolism enrichment score was based on decrease of cystathionine and increase of betaine and dimethylglycine. Eight other metabolites contributed to the enrichment, however their abundance changes were not significant between groups. The glutathione metabolism enrichment score was based on decreased abundance of glutathione and cysteinylglycine in FLT mice as compared with AEM controls, with additional contributions from four non-significantly changing metabolites. Fatty acid oxidation enrichment scores (both branched chain and very long chain) were based on abundance of propionylcarnitine and carnitine, with coenzyme A and acetyl carnitine contributing to the score as well. It should be noted that MetaboAnalyst does not recognize many lipids, therefore lipid metabolic pathways are likely under-represented. Contributors to enrichment of methionine metabolism were similar to those of betaine metabolism and consisted primarily of betaine, dimethylglycine and choline, with additional contributions from S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, suggesting activation of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cycle in the FLT mice. Abundances of these metabolites in FLT mouse livers and AEM controls are summarized in Table S2. For validation, metabolite pathway analysis was performed and similar pathways were found to have a high impact score based on enrichment and topology analysis (Figure S2). We previously reported a significant increase in abundance of betaine in FLT livers [4,5]. Betaine is metabolized from choline, which decreased in FLT mice [4,5]. Betaine is also a methyl donor and provides the methyl group for metabolism of homocysteine to methionine, generating dimethylglycine as well. Furthermore, the transmethylation cycle provides substrates used for the synthesis of cystathionine and GSH via transsulferation [23]; labile methyl groups are required for these processes as well as support of folate metabolism and synthesis of methylated compounds. Since methionine is lost in the transmethylation pathway, it is possible that choline is supplied to preserve pathway function [24]. However, the observed increase in abundance of betaine with a concomitant decrease in cystathionine and GSH suggests increased choline metabolism in spaceflight is not linked to augmented activation of one carbon metabolic pathways, since abundance levels of relevant metabolites such as S-adenosylhomocysteine, serine, sarcosine and glycine are unchanged. Therefore, other mechanisms are likely involved. Dietary choline and methionine induce lipotrophic effects through upregulation of very low-density lipoprotein export and fatty acid oxidation, and choline deficiency has been associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and steatosis. Shown in Figure 3, histological assessment confirms that spaceflight indeed results in increased presence of inflammatory cells as well as augmented steatosis. Although we previously measured upregulation of mRNA expression levels of PPAR-α, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation, it is likely that PPAR activation is mediated through increased retinol abundance instead of elevated choline [5]. Choline may be replenished by recycling from phosphatidylcholine, which may impair integrity of lipid membranes. Metabolomics analysis of choline-containing lysolipids revealed an average 40% decrease in abundance of these lipids in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls, although differences between groups were not significant for individual features (Figure S3). These results suggest that augmented metabolism of betaine, in excess of what is needed for methionine metabolism, may lead to injurious choline deficits in spaceflight mice. Whether this is causally related to decreased glutathione and the ability to respond to oxidative stress remains an open question. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Increased steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight. H&E staining was performed on fixed liver sections from n = 4–5 mice/group to investigate liver histology. Inspection of the H&E stained sections revealed that the AEM ground control mice had small cytoplasmic lipid droplets predominantly located in zone 2 whereas the FLT mice had an increase in slightly larger droplets distributed in a panlobular pattern. Multiple lipid droplets are indicated using white arrows. Furthermore, FLT mice showed increased accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly near portal ducts (yellow arrow). Representative images are shown from each group. PT = portal triad, CV = central vein. Scale bar = 100 μm.Notably, betaine serves as an organic osmolyte, protecting cells from effects of dehydration. Water intake in FLT mice was decreased by ~20% as compared to AEM controls, although food intake was unchanged (Table 2), therefore a likely cause for the upregulation of betaine is dehydration. We also measured upregulation of taurine, another osmolyte. Abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate was strikingly decreased (Figure S1A) and was the most important feature contributing to the clustering of groups in the PLS-DA analysis (Figure S1B). Guanidino compounds are metabolized from arginine, and dehydration modifies abundance of these compounds in the kidney [25]. Kidney injury not only results in reduced arginine synthesis but change in levels of guanidino compounds and their metabolism in muscles and liver [26]. The marked decrease in abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate may therefore be associated with dehydration in the FLT mice. Many of the most striking changes in metabolite and transcript abundances appeared to be related to increased dehydration of the FLT mice as compared to AEM controls; although this is a possible limitation of the study, a recent proteomics study on livers from male mice in the “Bion-M1” study flown in space for 30 days and re-acclimated showed results similar to those from our previously published data [22]. Therefore, either the Bion-M1 mice were also dehydrated, or the enriched pathways that we measured indeed have functional significance, potentially related to a shift in metabolic requirements due to unloading. Taken together, the data suggest that dehydration, coupled with oxidative stress, combine to deplete choline stores, leading to impaired lipid membrane metabolism and contributing to increased steatosis in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight.

Spaceflight Causes Broad Alterations in Transcriptome Profiles in the Liver To understand the role of transcriptional regulation in the observed alterations to metabolites, we performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptome datasets obtained with Affymetrix Genechip 1.0 ST arrays using GeneSpring software. We found significant alterations (p (corr) < 0.05) in 3005 out of 28,852 genes, or approximately 10% of identifiable probesets (Figure 4A,C). Of these, 601 genes were found to have biological significance; expression levels of 449 genes were upregulated (FC > 1.5) and 152, downregulated (FC < −1.5) (Figure 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Hepatic gene expression is significantly altered by exposure to the space environment. Profile (A) and scatter (C) plots of all significantly regulated genes (p (corr) < 0.05), and (B) profile plots of biologically significant genes with differential regulation FC +/− 1.5. Red lines (B) and points (C) indicate significantly upregulated genes in AEM mice, whilst blue indicate significantly upregulated genes in FLT. Yellow indicates genes that are statistically but not biologically significant.Analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) biological functions (Figure 5) revealed that most upregulated genes were involved in metabolism or basic cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and DNA repair. Of note, several autophagy-related genes were altered as were genes involved in oxidative stress and regulation of peroxisomes, in particular fatty acid synthesis and degradation (Figure 5A). Our previous studies found significant alterations in both mRNA and metabolites associated with activation of PPAR-mediated pathways, as well as alterations in fatty acid oxidation in response to spaceflight [4,5]. Furthermore, as peroxisomes catalyze redox reactions and are potential regulators of oxidative stress-mediating signaling pathways, it is possible that peroxisomes and mitochondria may cooperate to determine cell fate decisions [27]. Specifically, peroxisomes house several enzymes that can produce or degrade ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and therefore may act as modulators of oxidative balance [28,29,30]. Recent studies have shown that disturbances in peroxisomal metabolism play a role in the accumulation of cellular damage due to oxidative stress and therefore, cellular aging. There is also evidence that peroxisomes can act as upstream initiators of mitochondrial ROS signaling pathways [31]. However, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are yet to be fully elucidated. Figure 5. Open in a new tab GO biological functions associated with (A) up- and (B) downregulated datasets. Change in regulation was determined as the ratio of average expression of FLT to AEM values for each transcript, n = 6/group.GO analysis of downregulated datasets denoted alterations in the regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and cell signaling (Figure 5B). Several processes related to activation and regulation of the inflammatory response/immunity were also downregulated. Previous studies have shown significant deficits in immunity in response to spaceflight, including suppression of proliferation and differentiation in hematopoietic stem cell lineages [32,33], as well as shifts in immune cell phenotypes characterized by increased numbers of bone marrow-derived T cells and decreased bone marrow-derived B cell populations [34]. Furthermore, studies using cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ bone marrow progenitor cells revealed decreases in total cell number in microgravity samples, and additionally decreased erythropoiesis with concomitant increased macrophage differentiation [35].2.4. Pathways Involved in Lipid Membrane Metabolism and Protein Biosynthesis Are Enriched in Multi-‘Omics Datasets from Livers of Spaceflight Mice To further validate our metabolomics results, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets using the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Analysis function. This algorithm performs an enrichment analysis to determine whether the observed genes and metabolites in a given pathway appear more often than expected by random chance within the dataset. An additional topology analysis evaluates whether a given gene or metabolite plays an important role in a biological response based on its position within a pathway. An over-representation analysis based on hypergeometric testing using 17,403 genes and 247 metabolites was used for the enrichment analysis and topology was assessed with “Betweenness Centrality”, which measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others passing through a given node within the pathway. Integrated analysis of both genes and metabolites (Figure 6A) confirmed the impact of spaceflight on lipid membrane metabolism. Eight of the top 20 enriched pathways relate to lipid membrane metabolism (including glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism). Previously, we reported that Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed endocytosis as an enriched gene pathway [4], which was also the most highly enriched pathway in the gene-centric analysis (Figure 6B). Enrichment of inflammatory pathways was also evident by the presence of multiple pathways related to cancer. Supporting our other metabolite set enrichment analysis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism had high enrichment and topology scores in the metabolite-centric analytical workflow (Figure 6C). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Integrated enrichment analysis using multi-‘omics datasets from livers of spaceflight mice compared with AEM ground controls. Data were submitted to the MetaboAnalyst Integrated Pathway Analysis module. (A) gene-metabolite; (B) gene and (C) metabolite centric workflows were compared for n = 6 mice per group.Interestingly, several studies have shown that peroxisomes may alter lipid production and concentration in response to changes in metabolism, mediating cellular signaling through sphingolipids. In our analyses, we observed enrichment of sphingolipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism, as well as alterations in peroxisome gene expression levels, suggesting that spaceflight may alter peroxisome-related signaling pathways, including sphingolipids, to regulate cellular processes [36]. Sphingolipids, specifically, are important messengers for signaling events resulting in activation of cellular proliferation, differentiation or senescence [27,36]. Furthermore, sphingolipids have been linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential role of sphingolipids in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [37]. These results therefore indicate a potential connection between peroxisome redox metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress mediated by sphingolipid signaling pathways and resulting in upregulation of inflammatory/stress-related signaling, such as NF-κB. Of note, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis emerged as the top enriched metabolite pathway in the metabolite-centric analysis which, when taken together with enrichment of purine metabolism in the gene-metabolite centric analysis, suggested that spaceflight may increase biosynthesis or even post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs, the building blocks of mRNA decoding and protein translation. Post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs critically influences tRNA functions such as folding, stability and decoding [38,39]. Defects in tRNA modifications and modification enzymes are associated with oxidative stress [40] and human diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiomyopathy [38]. Indeed, results from a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans associating defects in post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs with dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation suggest that the cell's maladaptive response to hypomodified mitochondrial tRNAs may be a mechanism underlying disease development [41]. Although speculative, the idea that exposure to the space environment may lead to aberrant tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is provocative and warrants further investigation. Since MetaboAnalyst preferentially utilizes metabolic pathways for enrichment analyses, we further interrogated the transcriptomic dataset using EGAN (Exploratory Gene Association Networks) to confirm importance of enriched pathways [42]. We performed an association analysis using all transcripts significantly changing between groups (Figure 7). Three main clusters emerged. The first cluster focused on nucleic acid metabolism and included purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Purine metabolism enrichment was dominated by strong upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4D (Pde4d, Table 3), an enzyme with 3′,5′-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase activity that degrades cAMP, an important second messenger mediating signaling in multiple pathways. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (Ampd2, Table 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and maintains cellular guanine nucleotide pools [43], was downregulated, potentially attenuating protein synthesis. This protein also mediates gluconeogenesis in the rodent liver [44] and, together with Pde4d upregulation (Table 3), suggests pathways impacting cellular quiescence may be altered by spaceflight. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Cluster analysis using EGAN (Exploratory Gene Association Networks) software was performed using all significantly changing transcripts (p < 0.05). Genes associated with the top enriched pathways were clustered using a radial force-driven display. Insets are zoomed out views of each cluster. Only significantly changing genes are included in insets for clarity of presentation. Intensity of color (red = upregulated, green = downregulated, grey = not detected) is associated with degree of fold change and width of the bounding circle is inversely related to p (corr)-value. n = 6 animals per group were used for the analysis.Table 3.

Specifically, exposure of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to spaceflight following addition of osteogenic differentiation factors resulted in increased expression of genes related to neural development, neural morphogenesis and transmission of nerve impulses and synapses in studies conducted on the International Space Station [45]. This same study found increased expression of cell cycle arrest molecules indicating either increased differentiation of cells in space or activation of cellular quiescence or senescence [45]. Our previous studies have also found significant alterations in the proliferation and differentiation potential of both embryonic and bone marrow stem cells during 13–15 days of spaceflight, with upregulation of the cell cycle arrest and senescence marker cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN)1a/p21 [46,47,48,49]. Notably, analysis of our liver transcriptome dataset also found upregulation of CDKN1a/p21 (3.15 fold, p (corr) < 0.05, Table 3), as well as upregulation of INK4C/p18 with concomitant attenuation of cyclin gene expression (Figure S4). Similarly, GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using our whole transcriptome profile showed alterations in several pathways, including quiescent cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and activation of oxidative phosphorylation. When taken in total, these results suggest potential systemic induction of cellular senescence due to short-term exposure to the space environment. The second major cluster that emerged from our EGAN analysis was aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, supporting the MetaboAnalyst enrichment results, showing upregulation of expression of all genes within the cluster. Modifications regulate the turnover of RNAs, and improperly modified tRNAs are targeted for degradation [50], therefore it is possible that upregulation of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis actually targets cells for attenuation of protein translation due to hypomodifications or alterations of the epitranscriptome. Finally, we observed a third cluster of genes corresponding to enrichment of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as shown in Figure S5 and determined that the components of the 20S proteasome were significantly upregulated, supporting the observed pattern of molecular catabolism. Analysis of significantly upregulated datasets using GO analysis also indicated activation of catabolism, primarily in ATP-dependent and glycolytic pathways. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are the two main intracellular degradation pathways [51]. Autophagy primarily mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Since activation of the proteasome is associated with increased autophagy, we used BIOMART [52] to obtain a list of genes associated with autophagy GO terms and screened that list for expression changes using EGAN (Figure 8). We found significant upregulation in expression of a number of genes, including Atg2a, important for autophagosome formation as well as regulation of lipid droplet morphology and dispersion; microtubule-associated genes (Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b); Wipi1 and 2, involved in pre-autophagosome formation and the autophagy response to starvation; and Mtor, a central mediator of cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, supporting our GSEA results (Table 3). Alterations in the rate of autophagy have been shown to regulate ROS formation and redox balance under specific circumstances [53]. However, proteins damaged by ROS/RNS form protein aggregates that are degraded through the 20S proteasome in order to maintain cellular homeostasis [53]. Exposure to chronic or sustained oxidative stress can lead to inactivation of the proteasome, resulting in accumulation of protein conjugates. Heavily oxidized protein aggregates are also not suitable for degradation by the proteasome [54]. These aggregates may be specific targets of autophagy-related pathways mediated by heat shock protein chaperones, which were also altered in our analyses (Table 3). These results suggest that spaceflight leads to upregulation of multiple autophagy-related pathways and are consistent with activation of the proteasome and attenuation of protein synthesis in livers from FLT mice as compared with AEM controls. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Autophagy programs are upregulated in livers from spaceflight mice. Cluster analysis using EGAN software was performed using genes associated with autophagy programs generated by BIOMART. Genes were clustered using a radial force-driven display. Intensity of color (red = upregulated, green = downregulated, grey = not detected) is associated with degree of fold change and width of the bounding circle is inversely related to p (corr)-value. n = 6 animals per group were used for the analysis.Finally, we sought to determine whether decreased response to oxidative stress was associated with induction of autophagy and we performed a pathway analysis of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2)-mediated response to oxidative stress (Figure 9). We found significant downregulation of Nrf2 expression levels in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls (Table 3), as well as diminished expression of downstream pathway members, suggesting that exposure to the space environment leads to attenuation of oxidative defense. Notably, spaceflight studies using mice flown on STS-131 for 15 days also revealed downregulation of this oxidative stress mitigator in bone marrow tissues [46,47]. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient sample to directly probe for changes in protein oxidation, although oxidative damage is a likely cause for the observed increase in autophagy programs and upregulation of the proteasome in the FLT mice. Figure 9. Open in a new tab NFE2L2/NRF2-mediated pathways are downregulated in spaceflight mouse livers. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for analysis of mRNA transcript levels in livers from FLT and AEM control mice. Grey = unchanged, green = downregulated, red = upregulated. Intensity of color correlates with degree of fold-change. n = 6/group.Autophagy-related programs are essential for liver regeneration [55] and repair and induction of autophagy may occur in response to exposure to the space environment. Several studies have characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration of the liver in response to a variety of stress conditions and in response to partial hepatectomy (PHx), whereby a significant portion of the rodent liver is removed and the remaining portion regenerates and restores the liver to its original size. This process is highly regulated and includes several distinct stages, including withdrawal of hepatocytes from quiescence, cell cycle entry and progression, cessation of cell division and return of hepatocytes to quiescence [56,57,58,59]. Although hepatocytes are the first cells to replicate, they are followed sequentially by other cell types within the liver including stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells [59]. A recent study demonstrated that autophagy is critical in the prevention of hepatocyte senescence during the early stages of liver regeneration, and inhibition of autophagy-related genes results in delayed liver regeneration, aggregation of unfolded proteins, and activation of senescence in hepatocytes with a corresponding increase in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related molecules [58]. This also coincides with considerable damage to the mitochondria, reduced β-oxidation and reduced intrahepatic ATP generation, leading to dysregulation of hepatocellular lipid stores [58]. As we found mild upregulation of autophagy-related genes as well as upregulation of senescence, it is possible that autophagy pathways were initially activated to degrade oxidized proteins. However, as chronic oxidative stress has been shown to induce hepatocyte senescence, it is likely that senescence signaling pathways were activated in response to accumulation of oxidized proteins and failure of autophagy mechanisms to clear these proteins. Indeed, other studies have also demonstrated links between increased oxidative stress and increased hepatocyte senescence, resulting in steatosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction [60,61,62]. This senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is a regulated process driven by signaling through p21 and through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which we found to be upregulated in the current study (Table 3). Such changes are very similar to those that occur during ageing and obesity-related pathologies, such as insulin resistance, and have been associated with impaired energy generation and increased production of ROS. Studies conducted by us and others have shown spaceflight leads to increased oxidative stress, increased insulin resistance, and systemic induction of aging-related pathologies. It is possible that in the liver, increased oxidative stress and altered autophagy pathways may cause hepatocyte senescence through activation of p21 and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in hepatic steatosis (as we previously reported [5]) and impaired regenerative capacity. These molecular changes may have important implications for the onset of obesity-related diseases and regenerative health in the course of long-duration space exploration.3. Materials and Methods Animal studies were reviewed and approved by multiple Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) boards, including the NASA Ames Research Center ACUC (NAS-11-002-Y1; 31 May 2011), the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ACUC (FLT-11-078; 23 May 2011) and the University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional ACUC (1104.11; 10 May 2011). No protocol was required for assays performed at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center or Loma Linda University since only tissues obtained after euthanasia (no live animals) were analyzed at our sites. All NASA studies involving vertebrate animals were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. 3.1. Animals and Sample Collection Nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice were selected for this study because they produce fewer odor annoyance issues and were the only gender approved for flight (n = 15/group). Additionally, all historical data (e.g., STS-118) were obtained on female mice so the use of female mice permitted comparisons across missions, particularly for the musculoskeletal studies that were primary. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 10 mice per AEM habitat; 5 per side separated by a wire mesh) and either flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days (FLT) or housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC (Ground AEM controls; AEM). Following two days of acclimation after receipt, mice were provided a NASA NuRFB foodbar (TD 04197; 47% carbohydrate, 17.9% protein, 3.9% lipids, 2.8% fiber, 2.80 kcal/g). All mice were placed into AEM housing one day before flight. Environmental parameters for ground control mice were matched as closely as possible with flight conditions using 48 h delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle; foodbars and water were provided ad libitum. Tissues were harvested at the SLSL within 3–5 h after return of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and were distributed amongst a team of investigations through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program; we received one half lobe of liver from six mice per group. Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Liver lobes were extracted and dissected. A portion of the liver was prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde and the rest snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then shipped to either Loma Linda University or University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and stored appropriately prior to use.3.2. Transcriptomics Samples were prepared and analyzed as previously described [4,5]. Briefly, RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and the Ambion WT expression kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was employed to prepare mRNA for whole transcriptome microarray analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip 1.0 ST array (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Arrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Command Console Software v. 3.2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to produce. CEL intensity files which were processed with CARMAweb (Comprehensive R-based Microarray Analysis web service). GeneSpring software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to perform statistical analysis. Specifically, samples were first filtered on signal intensity values in order to remove background noise, statistical analysis was performed on normalized and filtered samples using a moderated t-test with Benjamini Hochberg FDR correction factor. Samples were then filtered based on fold change, whereby p (corr) < 0.05 and fold change +/− 1.5 or more was considered significant. CARMAweb files were then imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) software for subsequent analysis.3.3. Metabolomics Frozen liver pieces (n = 6/group) were shipped to Metabolon, Inc. (Morrisville, NC, USA) and stored at −80 °C before use. Samples were prepared for the appropriate instrument, either Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) or Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), as described previously [4,5]. Briefly, automated sample preparation was conducted to extract metabolites for analysis by LC and GC. Extracts were placed briefly on a TurboVap® (Zymark, Clackamas, OR, USA) to remove organic solvent. Each extract was then frozen and dried under vacuum.3.4. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) Extracts were split into two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. Metabolite features were measured using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns as described previously [4,5]. One aliquot was analyzed in positive ion mode under acidic conditions and gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C18 2.1 mm × 100 mm column, containing 1.7 µm resin, using water and methanol as mobile phases with both containing 0.1% formic acid. The other aliquot was analyzed in negative ion mode using basic conditions, which also employed water/methanol, and contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate for ion pairing. Mass spectrometric analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80–1000 m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm.3.5. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Extracts destined for GC/MS were vacuum desiccated for 24 h then derivatized under dried nitrogen using bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Volatile metabolites were separated using 5% phenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica (20 m × 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 µm film thickness) and a temperature ramp from 40 to 300 °C within 16 min; helium was used as the carrier gas. Compounds were analyzed using a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with electron impact ionization set to scan from 50–750 m/z at unit mass resolving power, as we previously described [4,5].3.6. Compound Identification Mass spectral data were loaded into a relational database and peaks were identified using Metabolon’s peak integration software [63]. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards based on the combination of retention time and mass spectra. Data were normalized to correct for variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Each compound was corrected by registering the medians to equal 1.00 in run-day blocks and normalizing each data point proportionately. Missing values, assumed to be below the limit of detection of the instrument, were imputed with the observed minimum after normalization.3.7. Data Availability Transcriptomics and metabolomics data are publicly accessible via the NASA GeneLAB data base. Transcriptomics data are found at the website (Available online: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-25/). Metabolomics data are available at the website (Available online: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-108/).3.8. Integrated Data Analysis MetaboAnalyst software (Available online: www.metaboanalyst.ca) was used for pathway and enrichment analysis of metabolomics data as well as integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets. Data were log-transformed and auto-scaled then subjected to various analytical modules within the software [64]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Exploratory Gene Association Networks (EGAN) [42] (Available online: akt.ucsf.edu/EGAN) were used to assess pathway activation based on changes in mRNA expression levels. Human Metabolite Database (HMDB) accession numbers were queried and names of genes associated with metabolites exhibiting significant changes in abundance were extracted manually. These genes were used to construct a subset list of genes that may be functionally significant, based on metabolite abundance changes, and this subset was also subjected to pathway and enrichment analysis.3.9. Histology Fixed tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as described previously [65]. Histologic images were captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a 4mp Macrofire digital camera (Optronics, Tokyo, Japan) using the PictureFrame Application 2.3 (Optronics). All images were cropped and assembled using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).3.10. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism V6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) using a Mann-Whitney U-test or unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction for comparison between groups. Means ± SEM were reported. The ROUT method with Q = 1% was used to identify outliers for exclusion from analysis. p (corr)-values less than 0.05 were selected to indicate significance.4. Conclusions The unbiased analyses presented here both support our previous results and extend them to show that exposure to the space environment for only 13.5 days results in increased oxidative stress due to elevated ROS and impaired oxidative defense (by way of attenuation of NRF2-related pathways) in the mouse liver. Furthermore, our multi-‘omics studies suggest that accumulation of oxidized proteins coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to activation of hepatocyte senescence, resulting in hepatocyte lipid accumulation and steatosis. Further investigation into the potential for liver damage in the course of long-duration space exploration is needed, as are development of effective countermeasures to protect astronaut health.Acknowledgments The authors thank Amgen and their support team for the opportunity to participate in this study, and Virginia Ferguson, Mary Bouxsein, Ted Bateman, Louis Stodieck and BioServe Space Technologies at the University of Colorado at Boulder for organizing the tissue sharing project.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865701/",
    "abstract": "Abstract While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well. Keywords: radioresistance, space exploration, longevity, DNA damage, Mars mission",

Copyright notice ID: 5865701 PMID: 29581875 Abstract While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well. Keywords: radioresistance, space exploration, longevity, DNA damage, Mars missionINTRODUCTION Cosmic radiation and microgravity represent two major environmental contributors to human health risks and substantially limit the prospects of long spaceflights [1]. The necessity to protect the human body from the deleterious effects of cosmic radiation has been largely overlooked. For deep space exploration missions, including the mission to Mars, exposure to radiation represents one of several unacceptable risk categories [2, 3], since cumulative doses received by astronauts would greatly exceed the human dose limits established within the current NASA radiological protection system [4]. A 3% exposure-induced death risk limit, mostly from fatal radiation-induced cancer, is set according to this paradigm [3]. Implementation of additional protection systems including biotechnological concepts described here may help resolve this issue and make it possible to begin the era of deep space manned missions. The main components of space radiation are solar particle events (SPE), geomagnetically trapped radiation and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) [5]. The contribution of the first two to the total dose absorbed by astronauts would obviously be negligible on long-duration missions away from Earth and the Sun. Consequently, GCR consisting mainly of highly-energetic particles (reviewed below) would be the primary type of radiation encountered by humans under this scenario ([2, 3, 6]). It has been estimated that a return trip to Mars could subject astronauts to radiation doses of 660 mSv [7]. Although great uncertainties exist with respect to health (cancer) risk estimates from exposure to cosmic radiation [7, 8], this dose alone represents more than half of the total NASA astronaut career limit of 800-1200 mSv [9]. Obviously, longer missions would not be acceptable for human in terms of cancer risk under current radioprotection guidelines. Due to very high energies of charged particles of GCR they easily penetrate passive shielding materials. Although active shielding technologies are also currently being explored, there has been no substantial progress in significantly reducing fluxes of GCR down to levels suitable for long-duration human space missions [10, 11]. It is therefore important to explore various prospects of improving human radioresistance using recent advances in biotechnology. These would include the possibility of genetic modifications to humans utilizing breakthrough technologies in gene editing in combination with the current knowledge of molecular pathways counteracting radiation-induced DNA damage, as well as other possible therapies, such as regenerative medicine, low-dose radioadaptation, the use of deuterated organic compounds, hypostasis (considerable slowdown of all the vital processes in the body) or a combination thereof. Finally, the primary focus of this concept review is the radioprotection against DNA damage driven health risks, mainly cancer. Some of the ideas in this review could potentially be utilized for alleviating other detrimental effects of long space travel, such as muscle and bone deterioration. In principle, ionizing radiation interacts along charged particle tracks with biological molecules such as DNA. The process is largely stochastic, and can damage DNA via direct interactions (e.g. ionization and excitation) or via indirect interactions such as through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of radiolysis of water molecules [12]. Radioresistance denotes the capacity for organisms to protect against, repair and remove molecular, cellular and tissue damage caused by ionizing radiation. It is a quality that varies greatly in terms of effectiveness between different organisms. For instance, it is well-known that certain organisms are remarkably resistant to the damaging effects of radiation. The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, for instance, possess error-free DNA repair mechanisms and can withstand doses as high as 7 kGy [13]. Similarly, tardigrades can withstand doses as high as 5 kGy, though doses exceeding 1 kGy render them sterile. Initially, the remarkable radioresistance of tardigrades was thought to be the result of their anhydrobiotic (i.e. dehydrated) state reducing the effective concentration of hydrolyzable water. However, subsequent studies have found that hydrated tardigrades were more radioresistant to both gamma-rays and heavy ions than anhydrobiotic specimens (the median lethal dose being 5 kGy for gamma-rays and 6.2 kGy for heavy ions in hydrated animals compared to 4.4 kGy for gamma-rays and 5.2 kGy for heavy ions an anhydrobiotic specimens) [14]. By comparison, the human median lethal dose is around 0.004 kGy. Currently, the European Space Agency ESA is conducting intensive research on the possibility of the remote space missions. Given that the flight will take place mainly under the control of automatic systems, where the participation of the astronauts is almost not necessary, the space crew will be virtually imprisoned for many months without having any work to do. Such situations may be dangerous, especially for the astronauts themselves. Therefore, the ESA believes that it would be wiser to immerse people into hibernation. Currently ESA has started the project “Aurora”, where the option of crew hibernation is considered. The project team intends to engage the biological mechanisms that will allow the crew to sleep and thereby reduce the metabolism of the organism to the absolute minimum [15]. It is worth emphasizing that the idea of possible hibernation during the long space missions was also explored in the USSR in 1969, but, unfortunately, after the death of the father of Soviet cosmic program Sergei Korolev the Soviet manned “Mars project” was closed, and all the work related to its implementation was terminated. The results of these studies included data on the hyperresistance to various damaging factors including lethal doses of ionizing radiation, long-term lethal overloads and hypobaric hypoxia in mice [16].SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT Beyond the reach of the Earth's magnetosphere, cosmic rays refer to a heterogenous pool of ionizing radiation with a diverse range of energies and charges. They can be subdivided into two main types, including galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) consisting of a constant flux of high energy particles originating in cataclysmic astronomical events outside the solar system, and solar energetic particles produced by the Sun ([17]). GCRs mainly consist of approximately 85% high-energy protons, 12% alpha-particles, and 2% electrons. Importantly, there is a small (1%), but biologically relevant presence of high charge (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) nuclei [18]. Due to their high linear energy transfer (LET), this HZE component of GCRs represents a significant danger, and they are predicted to account for most of the biological consequences of cosmic radiation exposure [19, 20]. It has long been recognized that HZE ions have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compared to gamma-rays and must pose a significant cancer risk to humans in space [21]. In addition to GCRs, astronauts in space are exposed to solar energetic particles (SPEs), emitted by the Sun produced either via solar-flares or coronal mass ejections. SPEs are unpredictable and are largely comprised of low to medium energy protons. Interaction of this primary cosmic radiation with the spacecraft shielding can create secondary radiation, mainly represented by neutrons, electrons, mesons and gamma-rays. This secondary radiation is thought to contribute to the overall radiation exposure as well [17, 18, 21, 22]. Recently, using NASA's models of risks and uncertainties, predictions were made for cancer and circulatory diseases related to space exploration missions to Mars near the solar minimum [2, 3]. It was estimated that radiation induced mortality and morbidity could exceed 5% and 10% with upper 95% confidence interval near 10% and 20% respectively for a Mars mission (Figure 1). Most recent estimates of cancer risks associated with Mars mission carried out using non-targeted effects model, thought to be more accurate at low-dose exposures, resulted in higher than previously assumed risks [23]. Figure 1. Major sources of space radiation. Open in a new tab The space radiation comes from three major sources including galactic cosmic rays, sun radiation and Van Allen radiation belts of the Earth.MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR EFFECTS OF COSMIC RAYS AND MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION Ionizing radiation's ability to induce genetic mutations had been established [24] well before the elucidation of the DNA double helix structure by Watson and Crick, or even before the Hershey-Chase experiment, which demonstrated that DNA is indeed the genetic material. The effects of ionizing radiation on DNA tend to be more serious than other biological macromolecules, with delayed systemic health effects being the outcome of DNA and chromosomal damage [25, 26]. The majority of cellular DNA lesions caused by ionizing radiation differ significantly from those caused by endogenous sources in their physical and chemical properties [27]. The most important features of radiation-induced DNA lesions are their complexity and clustering [28]. The radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) tend to be the most crucial for the cell fate and can thus be considered to be a basic trigger for the cellular response and adaptation to the radiation exposure [29, 30]. Because eukaryotic cells primarily repair DSBs via the method of non-homologous end joining or allelic recombination (see below), there exists an unfortunate tendency to lose genetic information by means of loss of heterozygosity and deletions, as well as genetic rearrangements [31]. This can lead to serious cytogenetic lesions and cell death, or transformation and oncogenicity via the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of certain oncogenes [32–34]. LET denotes the amount of energy released by a particle or a photon over the length of its trajectory (typically in a unit of energy per unit length, i.e. keV/μm). As discussed above, Galactic Cosmic Rays are comprised of high charge and energy particles (referred to as HZE). The considerable speed of these particles makes them essentially electron-free (in other words they carry a high positive charge) and consequently, due to their Coulombic interactions with matter, they tend to decelerate on a linear track. In contrast to X rays, gamma rays, beta-particles and high energy neutrons, HZE ions have very high LET levels. HZE particles, also called “densely ionizing radiation” typically deposit a large amount of their energy along linear tracks referred to as cores, while the remaining energy is deposited radially and uniformly by secondary electrons known as Delta-rays. In contrast, low-LET particles deposit their energy uniformly and are often referred to as “sparsely ionizing radiation”. We have previously illustrated the difference of microdosimetry profiles between low and high-LET [35], by using the example of one 1 GeV/u 56Fe particle traversing an hypothetical square cell. In this example, with the size of the cell picked so that one Fe track traversal leads to an average dose of 1 Gy in the cell, the local dose within 0.5 μm radially from the track is 26 Gy whereas the rest of the cell is only exposed to a uniform dose of 0.17 Gy deposited by Delta-rays (Figure 2). Figure 2. Comparative diagram on DNA damage induced by Low- and High-LET radiation. Open in a new tab HZE particles, also called “densely ionizing radiation” typically deposit a large amount of their energy along linear tracks referred to as cores, while the remaining energy is deposited radially and uniformly by secondary electrons (i.e. Delta-rays). In contrast, low-LET deposit their energy uniformly and are often referred as “sparsely ionizing radiation”.The most problematic type of DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation are DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Both low- and high-LET induce DSBs, but the complexity of damage varies with LET. We previously reviewed this topic in detail [36]. Briefly, if we accept the convention that a “simple DSB” is made of one break on each strand within a 10 base-pair region and “complex DSB” have at least one additional break between these two strand breaks, then roughly 80% of high-LET induced DSB are complex against only 20% for low-LET [37, 38]. The higher carcinogenic effect for high-LET [9, 39] has been explained primarily via the larger amount of complex break which hypothetically lead to more unrepairable lesions.RADIATION DNA DAMAGE AND MECHANISMS OF REPAIR All eukaryotic organisms have evolved against a backdrop of constant exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens, and as such have developed robust cellular mechanisms for DNA repair and protection against DNA damage. The mechanisms of cellular protection against DNA damage and mutation and of DNA repair can be categorized as immediate and adaptive defense mechanisms. Immediate defense mechanisms include: The production of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers that neutralize ROS produced by oxygen metabolism, ionizing radiation and UV radiation [40–43]. DNA repair [44–47], including direct reversal repair, base excision repair (BER) [48–51], nucleotide excision repair (NER) [52–54] and mismatch repair [44–47] for single strand modifications, and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), homologous recombination for double strand breaks (DSBs), and interstrand crosslink repair for modifications affecting both strands [55–58]; Elimination of damaged cells via apoptosis [59–64], and Proliferative arrest and replicative senescence [55–58, 65, 66] Substantial experimental evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may trigger a variety of protective responses within cells, tissues and organisms that serve to protect them from both exogenous (e.g high doses of radiation) [67] and endogenous (e.g. age-related accumulation of DNA damage) [68] genomic instabilities [69–71]. Importantly, these responses, collectively termed radioadaptive responses or radiation hormesis, may protect against spontaneous or induced cancer [72]. Since radiation-induced tumorigenesis is a major risk concomitant with long-distance space travel, radiation hormesis has posed serious questions on the adequacy and scientific justification of the international radiation protection standards [70]. They dictate that any, however small, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to a proportional increase in cancer risk, thus postulating that there are no safe levels of radiation exposure. This system is based on the Linear-No-Threshold model that extrapolates human atomic bomb survival data obtained for high-to-low doses [73]. It appears that low-dose radiation-induced protective mechanisms are not specific to a certain molecular or cellular pathway and cover a broad range of cell-autonomous (DNA repair, anti-oxidant, pro-survival gene activation) and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (immune system activation, bystander effects, etc.). In relation to space, it is important to understand how radioadaptive responses can be elicited upon exposure to high LET radiation types. Early radioadaptive response studies failed to demonstrate beneficial biological responses upon exposure to low doses of high LET radiation [74]. However, more recently such a possibility has been demonstrated using human cell lines. Not only low-dose X-ray exposure was shown to trigger better DNA repair and cause lower mutation frequencies in response to high doses of high-LET ion irradiation [75], but also low doses of high-LET irradiation were reported to produce radiation adaptive responses upon high doses of the same high-LET irradiation [76]. Rithidech and Scott [77] proposed that the protective mechanisms could be triggered in cells by a gamma-component that is produced within a body upon exposure to neutrons [78]. Additionally, it has been shown that low doses of low LET radiation may render resistance to genotoxicity and teratogenesis induced by high doses of HZE particles [75, 79]. Intriguingly, priming normal human cells with low doses of energetic protons resulted in lower chromosomal damage induced by subsequent exposure to iron ions [80]. All of these scenarios are relevant to radiation exposures experienced by human astronauts onboard of a spacecraft, making it thus conceivable that cells and tissues may be made resistant to detrimental effects of GSR by priming or ongoing exposures to low LET radiation. Genome instability resulting from DNA damage and mutation in both nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA caused by replication errors and exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens has long been implicated as one of the main causes of aging [81–86]. All of the above strategies for enhancing radioresistance in humans, from the expression and overexpression of exogenous and endogenous DNA repair genes, antioxidants and ROS scavengers, to the expression of exogenous radioprotective genes (e.g. Dsup), would also ancillarily serve as a means of attenuating DNA damage and mutation caused by exposure to the many endogenous and exogenous mutagens, foremost among these being endogenous ROS produced via normative cellular respiration, that are implicated in eukaryotic aging. As such, the above strategies for enhancing radioresistance in humans would also constitute a promising geroprotective strategy and a means of attenuating aging and promoting longevity and extension of both lifespan and healthspan in humans as well. In addition to the direct effect of radiation on the target cells, a so-called bystander effect has been described where nearby, but unirradiated, cells activate their DNA damage response [87, 88]. These non-targeted effects are underlain by various mechanisms, for instance, at a systemic level via the microenvironment and TGF-beta signaling [89], via extracellular vesicles (EV), natural nanoparticles secreted by different cells and carrying protein markers, peptides, mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), DNA, and retrotransposon elements involved in cell-cell communication. Recently miRNAs have been shown to play an important role in radiation induced bystander effects [90]. Not only can miRNAs be contained in EV, but also can be free floating throughout the circulation. One study has shown that these circulating miRNAs contribute to non-targeted effects by traveling between irradiated and nonirradiated cells and increase the cells radioresistance [91]. In some studies, specific EV are secreted after irradiation, in particular, after radiation therapy. Experiments on cell cultures have demonstrated that EV and probably mRNA present in these EV mediate the development of the bystander effect [92–94]. In addition, a direct correlation between the amount of EV and irradiation dose has been demonstrated [95]. In experiments performed by Jella KK et al., exosomes (particles sized 30-100 nm) and microvesicles (>100 nm) were isolated after cell exposure to radiation in different doses and their concentration depended on the irradiation dose [93]. In vitro experiments have shown that radiation-induced EV are easily absorbed by cells during co-culturing and due to some modifications in their molecular composition promote cell migration by enhancing activation of TrkA and FAK signaling. At the organism level, EV act as long-distance transport modules capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier [96]. EV also play an important role in the development of tumor process. Specific EV were isolated for human breast epithelial cancer, prostatic cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and stomach cancer [92, 97–100]. When evaluating the effect of space flight factors, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of microparticles produced by different cells under normal and pathological conditions should be taken into account, as they considerably influence the development of genetic instability, apoptosis, and tumor process. They can provide valuable information about the pathological process and serve as markers of the corresponding diseases.MAJOR HEALTH THREAT FROM COSMIC RADIATION Injury to the central nervous system Space flight conditions (SFC) significantly affect the operating activity of astronauts during deep space missions [101–103]. Ionizing radiation, especially GCR creates a risk for the normal functioning of the central nervous system, with acute and chronic exposure leading to alterations in the cognitive abilities, reduction of motor functions and behavioral changes [104]. In contrast to orbital flights, leaving the Earth's magnetic field drastically increases the exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and, above all, high-energy nuclei component of cosmic rays (HZE). Thus, during a 3-year-long mission to Mars, 13% of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) will be permeated at least once by an iron ion, while at the same time, ~ 50% of neurons in the hippocampus will be permeated by charged particles with an atomic number greater than 15 [105]. There are a lot of disparate data about the detrimental effects of the SFC onto the cognitive abilities, and on the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders [106, 107]. To date, the neurochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairments resulting from the effects of SFC are not clearly understood; even information about the potential risks for the CNS is contradictory [108, 109]. The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE particles, e.g. 56Fe. In rodent models, exposure to even small doses of 56Fe ions, was shown to induce pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In particular, a sharp decrease in spatial memory and orientation in the Morris water maze and Barnes maze were observed after exposure to 56Fe ions in doses 0.1-1 Gy [110] [111] [112] [113] [114]. Current estimates place the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for 1 GeV/u 56Fe particle-induced hippocampal memory impairment at around 50 [110]. Acute exposures of 48Ti ions in doses 0.02-0.2 Gy (1 Gev/n) significantly reduced the mean spatial memory of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly increased the percentage of rats with severe impairment, which manifested itself in subpar performance [115]. Indeed, 7, 11 and even 15 months following exposure to 56Fe ions in doses 1-2 Gy, the irradiated groups fared significantly worse on the ascending fixed-ratio operant task (bar pressing for food reward) than the controls. Rats exposed to proton doses of less than 3 Gy suffered disturbances in conditioned taste aversion 3 days following exposure [116] while doses of 3-4 Gy produced transient direct deficits in open field exploratory behaviour, acoustic startle habituation and rotarod performance in mice [117]. In a rat model, irradiation with high-energy protons in doses of 1-2 Gy induced a decrease in the efficacy of test performance in T-maze. The treatment caused a decrease in the concentration of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex and 3-MT, a metabolite of dopamine, in striatum [118]. Exposure to 1 Gy of 12C ions drastically reduced the content of 3-MT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex of rats [119]. This indicates that the prefrontal cortex is the most sensitive area of the brain in terms of the deleterious effects of HZE on the content of monoamines. Worth mentioning, the changes in the content of neurotransmitters regions rich in dopaminergic neurons, directly affect the emotional and motivational behavior, attention, spatial learning and contextual memory [120] [121] [122]. Finally, HZE can induce the strong disturbances in the CNS, especially in spatial memory and orientation. These disturbances may be critical for performance of astronauts in deep space missions. The non-radiation SFC, especially microgravity, can significantly change the effect of IR injury. Surprisingly, the SFC applied in combination may antagonize each other, for instance, IR eliminated the cognitive deficits occurring in response to the AS. The need for future experiments to further investigate this effect and its mechanisms is evident.Cardiovascular diseases The impact of prolonged exposure to microgravity on cardiovascular system has been well characterized. Tachycardia, baroreflex dysfunction, and reduced physical capacity were observed in experimental animals as soon as in 14 days after microgravity modeling [123]; [124]. Similar changes were observed in humans under conditions of modeled microgravity or after space missions [125]. Long-term sympathovagal imbalance increases the risk of fatal arrhythmias [126] and is the negative risk factor in cardiovascular disturbances and strokes [127] [128]. In astronauts, arrhythmia episodes were recorded during performance under stress [129]. NASA has recently reported increased cardiovascular mortality among lunar astronauts [130]. The authors attribute the observed phenomenon to the effect of lunar radiation on the endothelium. However, a recent report by Cucinotta et al suggests that such conclusions should be revisited due to methodological deficiencies in the analyses by Delp et al. and that circulatory disease due to space radiation does not contribute to mortality in astronauts [131].Immune effects Given that the organs of the immune system, including bone marrow and lymph nodes are some of the most radiation-sensitive tissues in the human body [17], it is of little wonder that abnormalities in the functioning of the immune system have been observed in astronauts as early as the 1970s [132]. In this regard, a depressed immune system in astronauts can potentially increase the incidence of infection, acute and chronic inflammation, and potentially carcinogenesis, while an enhanced immune response is associated with allergies and autoimmune diseases [133] [134]. Therefore, in combination with the greater virulence of pathogens in space [135], immune system dysfunction is of major concern for the expansion of human presence beyond Earth's orbit [136]. The human data on the precise impact of cosmic radiation on the immune system is lacking, mostly due to the fact that there have not been enough manned missions outside of the Earth's magnetic field. In vitro investigations show that the d0 (the mean lethal dose) values for various lymphocyte lineages range from 0.25-0.35 Gy [137]; by comparison, an average for mammalian oxygenated cells is around 1.5 Gy. Simulated cosmic radiation experiments performed on lymphocytes also indicate extensive chromosomal exchanges as a result of irradiation, the impact of which can be somewhat mitigated by shielding [138]. Data from animal model experiments performed on Earth is in accord with the above: in a rat experiment, whole-body 1 Gy irradiation produced an acute decrease in the concentration of circulating lymphocytes [139]. Subsequent experiments simulating galactic cosmic irradiation and solar particle events on mice demonstrated both chronic and acute deleterious effects on lymphocyte populations, functioning and chromosomal stability, with circulating B lymphocytes being the most affected, followed by T-cells and natural killer cells (reviewed in [17] and also in [140]). In the context of radioprotection, previous studies investigated whether pre-exposure to radiation might have an impact on an individual's radiation sensitivity of the immune system. So far, different studies gave contradictory results [141] [142] [143] [144]. Therefore it is worthwhile to further investigate whether pre-exposure to low-dose radiation may offer some degree of radioprotection.Cancer and aging The concept of DNA being the main target of ionizing radiation, combined with the classical views of molecular biology that DNA mutations are the main initiating and propagating events driving cellular neoplastic transformation and carcinogenesis [145], has led to the acceptance of the risk of fatal cancer as the major health risk of exposure to radiation [21]. Predicting such risks and their management is implemented in the current international radiological protection system that is comprised of a number of international and national advisory (e.g. ICRP, UNSCEAR) and regulatory bodies (e.g. NCRP, NIOSH, CNSC). Their cancer risk models and guidelines are predominantly based on the findings of the epidemiological life span study of atomic bomb survivors in Japan [146]. Although the exposure doses in those human cohorts were high, the derived relationship between dose and cancer is extrapolated back to low doses to calculate cancer risks encountered upon environmental or occupational exposure to low doses. This is accomplished with the help of a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor – accounting for sparing of the effect of chronic low-dose exposures – and a radiation quality factor that is based on relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of a particular radiation type and is linked to a LET value. Since high-LET particles – known for their high RBE - are a substantial component of cosmic radiation, fatal cancer risks associated with space missions are an obvious and a serious concern and limits space mission length. Cancer and aging are intricately related [147]. Indeed, aging, as a factor, is the largest contributor to cancer [147, 148]. A global view of how age affects the host was recently discussed by López-Otin et al. [85] categorizing nine “hallmarks of aging” in the host, but minimal evidence was included towards the direct impact of these hallmarks on cancer progression. Molecular factors involved in the hallmarks of aging are impacted by the individual organs, which are usually not considered a factor in carcinogenesis unless discussing the immediate tumor microenvironment [149]. Changes with the immune system as a function of age stemming from the spleen have potential to affect cancer risk and tumor progression [150]. Limited research exists on cancer risk as a function of age and sex for the interplay between organs. Astronauts typically have an age range of 35-55 years old [151] providing potential biological differences in the host as a function of age that can impact tumor progression. Age and sex are typically studied together obscuring the effects of a central determinant on overall cancer risk. Understanding how systemic host change as a function of age and HZE irradiation will greatly improve cancer risk models for space travel. In mice, genetic modifications that cause increases in lifespan are also able to concurrently reduce cancer rates [152] and vice versa [153]. Taken together, the model of aging-related accumulation of mutations (Lopez-Otin, 2013) and the multistep mutational theory of carcinogenesis [154] explain well such a strong connection. Although somewhat simplistic and not capable to explain some experimental observations (e.g. leveling off of cancer incidence at advanced age), this explanation may be useful for predicting cancer risks upon exposure to radiation since many observations related to aging can be used to draw connections to cancer. For example, disruption of DNA repair or DNA damage response pathways are frequently observed in both aging and cancer phenotypes [155, 156]. Since epidemiological studies of cancer incidence among astronauts are not practical due to low group size and associated low statistical power, terrestrial studies examining HZE particles-induced changes in various endpoints related to cancer and aging are of primary importance for improving cancer risk models for cosmic radiation exposures. Modeling cosmic radiation on Earth is extremely difficult due to its very complex particle spectrum and the presence of very high energy nuclei. However, various laboratories built around large nuclear facilities, such as accelerators, have used heavy ions of 56Fe, C, He, protons, and some others for studying the effects of HZE particles on a range biological endpoints, such as cancer, systematic response to radiation induced cancer, and DNA damage in both animal and cell culture models [157]. In vitro or ex vivo studies offer greater opportunities for detailed characterization of RBE as a function of LET for various endpoints related to carcinogenesis, such as chromosomal aberrations, mutations and neoplastic transformation when compared to in vivo studies, but are harder to relate the impact on aging. RBE of HZE particles for induction of neoplastic transformation in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells varied between 2 and 10 depending on the LET value of a particular heavy ion [158]. These RBE values may have been underestimated due to the use of X-rays instead of γ-rays as a reference radiation and the use of readouts at 50% cell survival levels. Using chromosomal aberration induction in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed ex vivo to various heavy ions, RBE values of 10 and 30 were produced for cycling and interphase cells, respectively [159, 160]. Interestingly, these studies independently revealed a similar pattern of RBE dependence on LET by using varying energies of Si nuclei [160] or different nuclei [158], with the maximum RBE observed at around 100 keV/μm. Similar RBE were shown for HPRT mutations [161]. Although very limited in number, animal studies in general show substantially higher cancer rates when compared to low-LET radiation exposures. Thus, HZE irradiation was 20-40 times more effective in inducing Harderian gland tumors in mice compared to low-LET irradiation [39, 162]. This effectiveness was even increased when a single acute dose was split into several fractions, indicating that the attenuation effect seen for low-LET radiation at low dose rate exposures is not present for HZE nuclei [163, 164]. Similar RBE estimates were obtained for skin and mammary tumors in rats exposed to Fe nuclei; however, no changes upon fractionation were found in RBE values [165–167]. Interestingly, Fe particles induced acute myeloid leukemia with the same efficiency as 137Cs γ-rays [162], consistent with α-particle results in mice [168] and the thorotrast patients study [169]. More recently, Miousse et al. [170] showed that epigenetic alterations related to genomic DNA methylation, rather that accumulation of DNA damage, were observed in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells of mice exposed to 56Fe heavy ions. With respect to aging, irradiation of fish embryos with 56Fe particles, but not γ-rays, lead to increased levels of lipid peroxidation products and other oxidative metabolism pathology, suggesting a higher potential of HZE ions to affect aging when compared to low-LET radiation [171]. Lastly, studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes from human astronauts flown on various length International Space Station missions showed increased levels of chromosome aberrations [172] and their stability over time indicating higher complexity and carcinogenic potential [173]. Overall, in vivo results are consistent with in vitro studies and confirm substantially higher capacity of the HZE component of cosmic radiation to trigger cancer-related changes compared to low-LET radiation. In addition, to the factors mentioned above recently miRNAs have been implicated in cancer risk and space radiation. MicroRNAs (small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) have recently been implicated in age, sex, radiation, and radiation bystander effects. It is known that each miRNA can target hundreds of mRNAs, which predicts that over half of the existing human transcriptome is regulated by miRNAs [174, 175]. A bystander response to low-LET radiation has been shown to have a sex-specific deregulation on miRNA signature in non-exposed spleens [176]. Evidence also suggests a tissue-specific coordinated pool of miRNAs contribute to the “hallmarks of aging” [177]. These pools of miRNAs are also shown to impact both innate and adaptive immune responses, which can be altered by cytokine stimulation from such factors as TGFβ1 [174, 175, 177]. Recent studies have also started to show the importance of certain miRNA signatures driving cancer progression [178–181]. Studies involving low-LET radiation have demonstrated specific miRNA radiation-dependent signatures [182], but little is known on the potential impact of miRNA and HZE irradiation. Overlap exists between the miRNA signatures in various cancers, age related miRNAs, and miRNAs associated with low-LET radiation, but little is reported on how all these factors uniformly impact cancer progression and effect cancer risk due to space radiation. Further, the impact of where and how the miRNAs affecting these factors (i.e. non-tumor related organs) is not understood. Although cosmic radiation risks include cataracts, circulatory disease, damage to CNS and others, risks of fatal cancer is the major component and contributor to overall radiation health risks that are being estimated and used for operation and planning of human space missions [183]. Due to the inherent paucity of human data on the space radiation effects on cancer and aging, and difficulties in recreating space radiation fields in the ground-based research studies to better characterize biological effectiveness of such radiation for cancer and aging related endpoints, current health risk estimates carry large uncertainties. It is therefore anticipated that cancer and aging will continue to play a dominant role in future studies to a) minimize the uncertainties to improve health risk management, b) to identify individual factors affecting radiation sensitivity and c) to generate sufficient knowledge for implementing various biotechnological countermeasures described in the next section.WAYS TO REDUCE HEALTH RISKS FROM SPACE RADIATION The principal scheme of the possible interventions to reduce the health risks from space radiation are presented in Figure 3. Figure 3. Ways to reduce health risks from space radiation during deep space travels. Open in a new tab Multiple approaches from medical selection of radioresistant individuals to gene therapy may be proposed.Medical selection of radioresistant people Countries actively engaged in development of the spaceflight missions, such as United States and Russia, have well-established protocols for selection of the potential candidates. While these selection pipelines differ substantially from one to another [184, 185], in vitro adaptive response studies is the only approach widely implemented for the medical selection of the radioresistant individuals [186, 187]. Nevertheless, according to current regulations, the results of such studies are not necessarily taken into consideration along the process of candidates selection for the spaceflight. There is a strong evidence of a wide range of adaptive response among different individuals, suggesting that medical selection of the candidates based on the in vitro adaptive response studies is very promising [108, 186, 188, 189]. The wide spectrum of responses may be explained by various rates of DNA damage accumulation and repair [190–194]. The general objective behind such studies is to collect the cell samples from the potential candidates (lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts, etc.) and using these samples for analysis of the adaptive response curves. The implemented readouts may include measurement of cell viability, various indicators of DNA damage and repair markers (H2AX, 53BP1, etc.) after the exposure to IR [151, 191, 195–199]. Moreover, markers specific to the particular DNA repair mechanisms (RAD51, Ku70/80, ATM) may be of a particular interest, as numerous studies have shown higher error-proneness of non-homologous end joining compared to the homologous recombination [29, 30, 36, 200–202]. Application of the comprehensive multi-omics analytical tools on transcriptomic and proteomic data may serve as another useful approach for the individual radioresistance assessment [203–206]. All the approaches discussed in the next chapters, combined with the initial selection of radioresistant individuals, should significantly empower our ability to protect space mission crew members against the HZE-irradiation.Small molecule-based interventions Radioprotectors and geroprotectors Small molecule interventions for radiation protection have been studied for many years. Such molecules are called radioprotectors. To date, amifostine (Ethyol, MedImmune) is still the only FDA approved radioprotector for treatment of radiation toxicity [207]. Nevertheless, there is still a large potential in this field. Particular pathways playing key role in aging-related pathologies are also involved into ionizing radiation response, for example PI3K/AKT [208], mTOR [209], NF-kB [210], p53 and ATM [211], FOXO, JNK and SIRT1 [212], ERK [213], JMJD3 [214], TGFb [215]. In other words, ionizing radiation causes accelerated aging both at the cell level (stress-induced premature senescence) and in the body [66, 216]. Therefore, it is not surprising that some geroprotectors (pharmacological agents that decrease the rate of aging and extend the lifespan) are able to reduce the damaging effect of ionizing radiation, for instance, curcumin [217], quercetin, (−)-epicatechin, and ibuprofen [218]. At the present day, according to Geroprotectors.org (http://geroprotectors.org/) [219] and DrugAge (http://genomics.senescence.info/drugs/) [220] databases, there are more than 400 potential geroprotectors, compounds that prolong model organism's life span at least in one concentration [221] (Figure 4). The drug repurposing approach may be very useful in search for the new radio- and geroprotectors [222]. Figure 4. Common molecular mechanisms involved in the response to the effects of space radiation and the geroprotectors affecting the regulation of those. Open in a new tab Space radiation induces cellular response through the direct DNA damage, ROS accumulation and non-targeted effects. These types of damage provoke distinct signalling mechanisms that may be regulated by the small molecules.The role of redox scavengers in radioprotection Glutathione (GSH) is a tri-peptide redox scavenger abundant in eukaryotic cells. Its capacity to prevent oxidative damage rests in the presence of a cysteine residue in both it and its cognate disulfide (GSSG). More specifically, the thiol group readily participates in radical chemistry, enabling it to nullify the deleterious effects of ROS. Indeed, in vitro assays show that GSH at concentrations of 100 μM (with the physiological concentrations being in the mM range) was capable of protecting equimolar nucleic acids from γ radiation-induced degradation, even at doses reaching 400 Gy [223]. On a cellular level, it has been known for a long time that exogenous supply of glutathione can serve as a radioprotectant – lymphoid cell lines subjected to GSH depletion exhibit radiosensitivity to 7 Gy of γ radiation, which is rescued by GSH repletion [224]. In addition, GSH can serve as a useful biomarker of cellular oxidative stress and aging; in a rat model, young specimens had significantly higher levels of intracellular GSH, which correlated negatively with the extent of DNA damage [225]. There is evidence that the radioprotective properties of glutathione can be exploited therapeutically. For example, diselenonicotinamide (DSNA) is a synthetic organometallic compound, the administration of which in a cellular context protected Chinese Hamster Ovary and murine splenic lymphocyte cells from radiation-induced cell death at doses of 25 μM administered before and even after the irradiation of 1-12 Gy [226]. Another compound, silymarin, when administered orally for 3 days in a mouse model resulted in a 67% survival rate after 30 days following lethal 9 Gy γ irradiation, with a concomitant increase in the activity of enzymes participating in the GSH pathway [227]. The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its cognate reduced form, NADH, is a reducing equivalents carrier known for participating in various metabolic reactions paramount to cellular respiration. Whilst originally thought of mostly as a metabolic ancillary, evidence has emerged of it being an important indicator of the redox state of the cell, and concomitantly, a factor in aging and tissue regeneration. Early reports at the turn of the decade suggested that NAD levels are negatively impacted by high-fat diet and linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D), with NMN (a precursor to NAD) supplementation being capable of improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in a mouse model of T2D [228]. Strikingly, NAD levels were shown to decrease with age, and along with them the activation of a histone deacetylase family of proteins, known as Sirtuins (SIRT1-7). Sirtuins, responsible for the regulation of gene silencing, use NAD as a cofactor and also happen to be involved in aging and disease. For instance, one of the targets of SIRT2 is a mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1, the levels of which have been associated with longevity. In a mouse model, the age-related decline in BubR1 levels was predicated upon the decline in NAD levels and vice versa: overexpression of SIRT2 or administration of NMN increased BubR1 levels [229]. Furthermore, it was later shown that NMN was capable of ameliorating some of the more deleterious effects of aging in a mouse model, with a 12-month-long trial demonstrating NMN's positive effects on metabolism and physical fitness, as well as vision [230]. The recent work from the Sinclair lab at Harvard Medical School further establishes the link between NAD and aging by supplementing it with their research on DNA damage. PARP1, a protein heavily involved in ssDNA damage repair, also uses NAD as a cofactor. Interestingly, PARP1 gets sequestered and inactivated by a protein called DBC1, which incidentally also happens to inactivate SIRT1. This led to the hypothesis that elevating NAD levels by administering NMN will lead to a decrease in PARP1 inactivation by DBC1, leading to an increase in the rate of DNA repair. A number of observations confirmed this, most notably the fact that older mice tended to have lower hepatic NAD concentrations and higher amounts of the PARP1-DBC1 complex, both of which were improved by NMN [231, 232]. The key region in DBC1 responsible for PARP1 sequestration appears to the Nudix Homology Domain (NHD), which is present in a large number of proteins involved in DNA repair [233]. Thus, NAD and its precursor NMN appear to be key regulators of protein-protein interactions and DNA damage response networks, and as such NMN supplementation needs to be taken seriously as a possible branch of radioresistance.Hypostasis, hypothermia and biobanking Soon after the launch of the first human space missions, the lead designer of the Soviet space program, Sergei Korolev, has began to develop an ambitious project of a manned flight to Mars. His idea was to put the crew into a hibernation state during lengthy space travel. Although a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Vasiliy Parin, has termed this hypothetical process as ‘hypobiosis’ [234], the more currently used term, ‘hypostasis’, which more accurately reflects this physiological process, since the desired hibernation state requires not only a decrease of the metabolic rate, as we will describe later, but also the slowdown of all vital bodily processes down to a complete standstill (stasis), with the possibility of subsequent recovery [235]. The development of a hypostatic state (HS) is based on the repression of complexes III and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and transition of the warm-blooded organism into the bioenergy of cold-blooded animals (i.e. bioenergetics of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle). The extensive experimental work on the laboratory animals which attempted to generate the HS at different temperatures, various durations and degrees of depth, has led to surprising discovery that mammals have increased resistance to the influence of extreme factors. Among others, such factors include the deeper levels of hypothermia to 0°C, deadly doses of radiation, a state of severe irreversible shock blood loss, hypobaric conditions of oxygen deficiency (18 km) and deadly magnitude of the overload (up to 50 g) [16]. Although the hypostatic state has a potential to greatly reduce, if not fully eliminate, the radiation-associated risks, and may have a wide range of applications for future deep space missions, at the present time, it is quite far from the practical usage and requires years of extensive research before it can be applied in humans. On a more futuristic note, departure of humanity from Earth to colonize other objects/planets, may not be compatible, even with all the biomedical and biotechnological advancements of the time, with the long-term survival of the human population due to radiation damage encountered during the spaceflight itself. In such case, transportation of a bank of cryopreserved germ cells destined to give rise to a new population of humans on another planet/object seems to be a reasonable alternative. Indeed protecting a bank of frozen cells from cosmic radiation physically is obviously more feasible than protecting a population of humans. Yet, none of the humans presently living on Earth may witness such endeavour of our civilization and there is hope that a variety of other strategies described here that could make human sufficiently radioresistant to withstand multi-year exposure to cosmic radiation will eventually succeed [236].Gene therapy for deep space exploration Overexpression of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants One promising strategy is to overexpress endogenous antioxidants via administration and expression of their cognate transgenes [237]. A variety of teams have reported increased radioresistance following the delivery of magnesium superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) transgenes in a variety of tissues. MnSOD transgenes have been delivered both systemically [238] and in a tissue-specific manner [239, 240] using plasmid/liposomal vectors, resulting in a substantial reduction in early and late-stage irradiation damage. Note that antioxidants can only protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) primarily produced by water radiolysis during exposure to ionizing radiation. As such, a fraction of the DNA damage induced by direction ionization of DNA cannot be prevented by antioxidants. The majority of DSB and SSB generated by low-LET are induced by ROS (“indirect effect”) and thus antioxidants would be most efficient against low-LET. In contrast, the majority of damage for high-LET are due to direct ionization of DNA making antioxidants less efficient. However, constitutive overexpression of endogenous antioxidants could detrimentally interfere with redox signalling [241]. Additionally, while current clinical evidence suggests that dietary antioxidant supplementation does not interfere with radiation therapy for cancer [241, 242], there is a minimal possibility that constitutive overexpression of antioxidants could reduce the clinical efficacy of radiation therapy for cancer in the event of subsequent carcinogenesis. This may happen due to enhanced DNA repair capabilities in cancer cells. Constitutive expression would also presumably provide anticarcinogenic benefits though prior to carcinogenesis due to constant reduction of endogenous ROS. It would therefore be prudent to use inducible expression constructs (e.g. inducible promoters), so that if carcinogenesis were to occur the expression of such endogenous antioxidants could be halted by no longer administering the trigger stimulus used by the inducible expression system. Indeed, an even more robust approach would be use distinct inducible expression systems, such as the use of distinct inducible promoters, on a tissue and organ-specific basis. If the same inducible promoter were used to control the transcription of endogenous antioxidants in all tissues and organs of the body then halting the administration of that inducible promoter's trigger stimulus in the event of carcinogenesis would halt the radioprotective benefits conferred by antioxidant overexpression in all tissues and organs of the body. If, however, distinct inducible promoters were used to control antioxidant transcription and expression in distinct tissues and organs then halting the administration of an inducible promoter's trigger stimulus could be restricted to the tumor's tissue of origin without negating the radioprotective benefits of antioxidant overexpression in all other tissues and organs using a different inducible promoter.Overexpression of endogenous and exogenous DNA repair genes Overexpression of human and non-human DNA repair proteins in mammalian cells has been previously explored as a strategy to enhance the efficiency of endogenous DNA repair and to reduce mutagenesis and associated carcinogenesis in animal models [243, 244]. This constitutes an intriguing strategy that could be utilized to enhance radioresistance of humans for the purposes of deep space exploration. Some instances (such as overexpression of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase and yeast AP endonuclease) have led to enhanced protection from endogenous and exogenous mutagens, while others (e.g. overexpression of alkyl N-purine glycosylase and DNA polymerase β) resulted in increased genome instability [243, 244]. Continued progress in elucidating which DNA repair proteins result in increased DNA repair capabilities and which do not will aid in the eventual determination of which DNA repair proteins can be usefully overexpressed for the purposes of enhancing radioresistance in humans. However, as with the case of overexpression of endogenous antioxidants, even those DNA repair proteins that show largely beneficial effects in terms of mutagenesis protection may reduce the clinical efficacy of radiation therapy for cancer in the event of subsequent carcinogenesis due to enhanced DNA repair capabilities in cancer cells when constitutively expressed [245], while simultaneously enhancing protection from carcinogenesis prior to actual malignant transformation. It would therefore also be prudent to use inducible expression constructs (e.g. inducible promoters) in the case of overexpression of DNA repair genes as well, and to explore the possibility of using tissue and organ-specific inducible promoters to open up the possibility of halting the administration of the inducible promoter's trigger stimulus exclusively in the tumor's tissue of origin, while still maintaining the radioprotective benefits of DNA repair gene overexpression in all other tissues and organs. DNA repair processes have evolved to repair isolated endogenous DNA damage. Therefore, cells can be overwhelmed with the very unlikely event of multiple DSB occurring at the same time in close proximity within the nucleus. It has been shown that the probability of genomic rearrangements resulting from incorrect end joining is higher [246–248]. Movement of individual DSB into common repair domains makes such genomic rearrangements more likely than previously anticipated [35] and such phenomenon has been coined “DSB clustering”. Computer models have shown that spatiotemporal distribution of DSB is in fact sufficient to predict individual cell death probability [249]. In addition, DSB clustering is a lot more probable for HZE due to the significant proximity of DSBs along particle tracks (see Figure 2). As such, one can predict the LET dependence of RBE for clonogenic survival by simply taking into account the spatiotemporal distribution of DSB and the inherent clustering properties of DSB [36, 249–251]. In this model, two isolated DSB are less toxic to a cell than two clustered DSB and thus shows that DNA repair is not as efficient in dealing with HZE-induced DSB. In addition, DSB induces complex DSB [252], as discussed in previous section, which are poorly repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), the primary DNA repair mechanism of cell [253]. Therefore, DNA repair gene overexpression will be less efficient for exposure to HZE compared to low-LET. As previously discussed in detail [36], chromatin density mediates the response to DNA damage. The full mechanism by which this happens remains unclear, but local chromatin structure appears to play a role. Chromatin decondensation around the DSB is believed to be an important trigger for ATM dimer dissociation and subsequent ATM autophosphorylation and activation [250, 251]. We have hypothesized that DSB clustering is also modulated by chromatin remodeling and may differ depending on the cell cycle [254]. Therefore, the ability to modulate the chromatin density is another potential direction to infer protection to the cell, with tightly packed DNA being better protected and thus more resistant to ionizing radiation [255]. Interestingly, high chromatin condensation is typically associated with gene silencing and lower cell activity, just like hypostatic state leads to a full stop in cell activity and radioresistance.Expression of endogenous and exogenous radioprotective transgenes Another potentially more promising strategy involves the delivery and expression of exogenous and translational radioprotective transgenes. Many organisms (e.g. tardigrades, Deinococcus radiodurans) possess remarkable degrees of radioresistance, and if the genes and molecular mechanisms conferring such high degrees of radioresistance can be elucidated and translated to humans via gene therapy then this would constitute a much more effective strategy to enhancing radioresistance in humans for the purposes of deep space exploration than the overexpression of endogenous radioprotective genes, which are comparatively limited in their radioprotective effect. Tardigrades, for instance, are not only remarkably resistance to the damaging effects of irradiation [14, 256]; but much more remarkably have been shown to survive direct exposure to space in low Earth orbit [257]. A nuclear protein thought to aid in protection of DNA from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation in tardigrades, termed Damage suppressor (Dsup), has recently been discovered [258]. This protein co-localizes with tardigrade DNA, and has also been shown to co-localize with nuclear DNA in human cultured HEK293T cells. The protein is highly basic, which suggests that it may associate with nuclear DNA via electrostatic interactions, although the protein's mode of interaction with DNA remains to be comprehensively elucidated. To examine the possibility that the association of Dsup proteins with nuclear DNA aids in protecting DNA from radiation damage, the team stably expressed Dsup using the constitutive CAG promoter, and confirmed co-localization with nuclear DNA via immunocytochemistry. When the HEK293 cells were exposed to 10 Gy of X-ray irradiation they found that the transfected cells had roughly half as many SSBs than the control group. They also examined its effect on the amount of DSBs in the transfected cells via a neutral comet assay and via analysis of the number of γ-H2AX foci (an indicator of DSBs), and using both assays found a 40% reduction in DNA fragmentation in the transfected cells compared to the control group. They also analyzed cell viability following irradiation, as human cells often lose proliferative ability following 3-7 Gy of X-ray irradiation, and found that following 4 Gy X-ray irradiation the transfected cells had slightly increased viability, a much more normal morphology and higher proliferative ability than the irradiated control cells. Thus, the delivery and expression of Dsup transgenes in vivo represents a promising candidate for potential exogenous radioprotective transgenes that would aid in establishing enhanced radioresistance in humans for the purpose of deep space exploration.Characterization of the genetic determinants of high human radioresistance in conjunction with clinical translation via multiplex genetic engineering Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are variations in single nucleotides that occur at specific positions within an organism's genome and that are present in an appreciable portion of a population (e.g. > 1%). As known from radiation oncology, human individuals differ in acute radiosensitivity to high therapeutic doses of radiation [259]. This is driven by genetic germline variation, 90% of which is expressed as SNPs [260]. Limited and inconclusive evidence also exists that suggests a link between genetic variance and health risks associated with low-dose radiation exposures [261] and this issue has been identified as one of the most important questions in low-dose radiobiology (EU low-dose research program DOREMI, http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/183770_en.html). The SNP profile of a given individual characterizes the uniqueness of their genome. As such, individual differences in radiosensitivity within the human population can be characterized by differences in individuals’ SNP profiles and epigenetic profiles. This opens the door to one conceivable strategy – known as genome-wide association studies or GWAS - for determining the SNP and epigenetic profiles of individuals highly radioresistant to low-dose radiation: performing life-long studies of radiosensitivity in very large human cohorts with known radiation exposure doses. These exposures could be both environmental in areas with high natural background radiation levels [262], and occupational, such as InWorks cohorts [263]. One could conceivably find populations that have naturally been exposed to low-dose radiation, such as airline pilots and crews, populations exposed to background radon or on top of granite, etc. In this way the genomic and epigenetic profiles of individuals highly resistant to low-dose radiation could be characterized via RNA SEQ and genome-wide epigenetic profiling of each individual in the cohort. The incidence of cancer (minus the baseline natural rate of cancer incidence) and other diseases in which irradiation is causally implicated would be tracked and associated with individuals’ SNP profiles. In this way, the specific SNP profiles of highly radioresistant portions of the cohort (i.e. those with the lowest incidence of cancer) could be identified, and those SNP variants that are shared among the most radioresistant portions of the cohort identified via statistical analysis. The result of such a large-scale study would be the most likely set of candidate SNP variants that confer high radioresistance in the human population. This strategy resulted in significant advances in understanding a role of genetic variability in several diseases and identification of molecular targets translatable into clinics [264]. Particularly encouraging is the fact that successes have been achieved for complex phenotypes – cancer being also a complex multistep disease - that are highly polygenic, such as psychiatric symptoms and autoimmune diseases [264]. Although the cost of SNP profiling has dropped significantly over the past few years and it is conceivable to carry out such an SNP study in a large cohort, low incidence of cancer due to low-dose radiation exposures may limit if not preclude the ability to conduct such large-scale SNP studies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies may help counter this issue, but at the cost of substantially increasing the cost of such studies. Additionally, the use NGS as opposed to SNP profiling may help identify those rare genetic variants that have a role in radiosensitivity but not detectable by SNP profiling. Gene-wide association studies (GWAS) would provide the best possible association between natural genetic variation and radioresistance, and the best available means of characterizing the genetic and epigenetic determinants of radioresistance and radiosensitivity in the human population. If the specific SNP variants conferring increased radioresistance in the human population can be characterized, this opens up the possibility of using targeted gene editing technologies (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9) to replicate those SNP variants in individual humans. While the scale involved is clinically unprecedented, likely requiring hundreds to thousands of nucleotide modifications per genome, and hundreds to thousands of modifications per genome per cell unless germline genetic engineering were employed, it nonetheless constitutes a foreseeable future strategy for enhancing radioresistance in humans for the purposes of deep-space exploration.Generation and characterization of enhanced radioresistance via experimental evolution in conjunction with clinical translation via multiplex genetic engineering An additional strategy is to employ experimental evolution [265] so as to generate populations of model organisms or human cells with enhanced radioresistance by exposing each generation to high levels of radiation and allowing the survivors to breed, followed by the characterization of the genetic determinants of the resulting enhanced radioresistance phenotype and the subsequent clinical translation of such genetic determinants in humans via multiplex genetic engineering. As a case study, a team led by Michael Cox produced a highly radioresistant population of Escherichia coli (i.e. 3-4 orders of magnitude more radioresistant to 3000 Gy of IR than the originating generation). Of the 69 mutations generated, only 3 nucleotide changes in the DNA metabolism genes recA, dnaB, and yfjK accounted for the vast majority of the extremophile phenotype, with 4 other mutations providing small but measurable contributions to the phenotype [266]. By employing this method using model organisms with DNA repair pathways conserved in humans, populations with extreme radioresistant phenotypes can be generated and the genetic determinants underlying the extremophile phenotype could be characterized and translated to humans using multiplex genetic engineering (e.g. via the CRISPR/Cas9 system) in a manner similar to that proposed for translating natural highly-radioresistant SNP profiles in the human population to individual human patients.Apoptotic & regenerative technologies The above strategies involve enhancing radioresistance in humans. An alternative strategy involves employing therapeutic modalities in regenerative medicine [267–269] to facilitate the elimination and substitution of endogenous cells damaged by cosmic irradiation. The present strategy can be subdivided into two distinct approaches consisting of random elimination and substitution on the one hand and targeted and radiation-responsive elimination and substitution on the other. Random elimination and substitution would involve ablating and replacing biological systems in a random fashion, independent of the level of irradiation damage they have acquired, in order to eliminate and replace any cells, tissues and organs that may have sustained enough irradiation damage to put them at substantial risk for carcinogenesis. The scale of elimination and replacement could take place on the level of individual cells, tissue or organs depending upon the specific modality of regenerative medicine employed. For instance, whole tissues and organs could be eliminated and replaced via the use of engineered tissues and organs, periodically according to the calculated rate of damage and consequent physiological detriment (i.e. by measuring or estimating the amount of cosmic radiation exposure and replacing a given tissue or organ once within the period of time it is calculated to have experienced enough cosmic radiation exposure to result in serious physiological detriment, e.g. a high risk of carcinogenesis). Alternatively, at the level of cells, a recently proposed therapeutic modality in regenerative medicine titled Induced Cell Turnover (ICT) could be employed to periodically abate the endogenous cells constituting an individual's tissues and organs and replace them with either patent-specific or HLA-matched human pluripotent cells (hPSCs) in a gradual and multi-phasic manner [270, 271]. The proposed procedure consists of the quantitative and qualitative coordination of targeted endogenous cell ablation with hPSC-derived exogenous cell administration to mediate partial and whole-tissue/whole-organ replacement at the cellular level, mediated in a gradual, multi-phasic manner so as to minimize the spatiotemporal distribution of ablation and replacement for the purpose of maintaining the homeostatic (i.e. structural and functional) integrity of tissues and organs throughout the course of the procedure. It is distinct from normative cell therapies by the quantitative and qualitative coordination of endogenous cell ablation with exogenous cell administration for the purpose of creating readily-accessible vacant niches for administered cells to engraft and is presumed to increase the engraftment efficacy of administered cells. While the authors originally proposed the therapeutic modality as a means of periodically attenuating the accumulation of age-related phenotypic deviation for the purposes of treating age-related disease, it could potentially be employed for the purposes of periodically negating acquired irradiation damage in the tissues and organs of humans undergoing long-term space travel, along timescales and employing ICT rates and spatiotemporal distributions that are calculated to facilitate the induced turnover (i.e. elimination and replacement) of cells at the rate at which they are expected to acquire enough irradiation damage to put them at substantial risk of malignant transformation [271]. The ultimate aim, then, would be to facilitate the induced turnover of tissues and organs at least once within the span of time it would take to put them at high risk for carcinogenesis as a result of acquired cosmic irradiation damage, which is a function of the duration and level of exposure to cosmic radiation that spacefaring humans undergo. Indeed, such a proposal could have positive potential implications as a preventative strategy for carcinogenesis in general, regardless of exposure to cosmic irradiation. The above strategy could also potentially be used to attenuate the negative physiological effects of long-term exposure to microgravity when specifically targeted to the constitutive and supportive cells of muscular and osseous tissues. The second approach, involving the targeted and radiation-responsive elimination and substitution of cells, consists of engineering the cells constituting an individual's tissues and organs to undergo apoptosis in response to the acquisition of irradiation damage in a targeted fashion, in accordance with either the self-detected levels of cosmic irradiation they are exposed to or the self-detected amount of irradiation damage that they acquire, such that they commit apoptosis at levels of acquired irradiation damage (e.g. clustered DNA damage) below the levels normatively required to induce the endogenous apoptotic response to DNA damage. This would most likely consist of the use of a radiation-responsive promoter that drives expression of a synthetic or a recombinant transcription factor that binds very specifically to a synthetic promoter that up-regulates a pro-apoptotic factor (Figure 5). Such system needs to be tuned up such that even slight up-regulation of the synthetic transcription factor would lead to a robust expression of a pro-apoptotic factor, ensuring elimination of a cell damaged by cosmic radiation. Also, this system would need to include a trigger for the activation of somatic stem cells (SCSs) in the case of renewing tissues and engineered hPSC niches in the case of non-renewing tissues so as to replace those endogenous cells that are terminated in response to cosmic radiation exposure. For instance, the radiation responsive promoter could also control the transcription of an endocrine factor, activates and/or upregulates SCS or hPSC endogenous and/or synthetic or translational factors controlling SCS and hPSC proliferation and mobilization in a targeted manner (such that each distinct tissue-specific SCS and hPSC population is equipped with a specific promoter correlating with a distinct synthetic or translational endocrine agent). Obviously the technical realization of such a genetic regulatory system will require substantial effort. However, many elements of it can be suggested using present knowledge. For example, radiation-inducible promoters have been proposed and optimized for use in combination with radiotherapy for cancer and may include the egr-1 promoter or its elements [272], a fusion of dCas9 with multiple copies of the herpes virus transcriptional activation domain VP16 guided to the synthetic promoter of a pro-apoptotic factor by small guide RNA [273], also driven by the radiation-inducible promoter, to ensure its specificity and a lack of activation at the basal condition (Figure 5). Figure 5. Conceptual diagram of a genetic system for elimination of radiation-damaged cells and subsequent inducible stem cell activation and regeneration of affected tissues. Open in a new tab A variety of specific genetic elements that could be used in such system have previously been described (see text for further detail).These considerations, however, need to take account of quantitative assessment of the rate of lethal/oncogenic cell damage occurring as a result of exposure to cosmic radiation. Thus, it was estimated that every cell of a human body is traversed by a proton every three days, by a helium ion every month and by a HZE particle every 100 years [274]. Whereas traversal by a proton may not be lethal or mutagenic since only at the end of a track a proton would produce a highly compact ionization track, heavier particles would definitely produce sufficient damage to either kill or produce chromosome damage upon every hit. Therefore, it would be ideal if the trigger of cell removal would sense the outcome of cell response to a particle hit, rather than a hit itself, so that every cell is given an opportunity to successfully repair damage. This would lead to removal of only those cells that failed to properly repair their genomes, helping to maintain the regenerative potential of the body or exogenous sources for longer periods of time. One potential limitation of such a system would be leakage as a result of its non-linear regulation, and as such stringent preliminary studies and trials to as to optimize its design for liminal leakage would be required. Such an idea is nonetheless presently conceivable and as such constitutes a future research strategy that should be explored for the purposes of minimizing the effects of cosmic irradiation for the purposes of long-term human space travel, and could have additional use as a general preventative strategy against carcinogenesis via the use of both radiation-responsive promoters and carcinogen-responsive promoters.Deuterated organic compounds All organic compounds contain carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. It is, however, possible to synthesize organic compounds that have hydrogen atoms replaced by deuterium (the stable isotope of hydrogen) at specific locations. Due to deuterium's comparatively greater mass with respect to hydrogen, carbon-deuterium bonds require more energy to break and take longer to break than C-H bonds. Consequently, the energy required to break the hydrogen bonds between DNA bases would be greater, and deuterated DNA would be less subject SSBs and DSBs than non-deuterated DNA. The extent with which we could deuterate a given organism, however, is limited by several potential problems. Specifically, the rate at which bonds between deuterium and other atoms break is lesser than the rate at which bonds between hydrogen and other atoms break due to the kinetic isotope effect (a mechanistic phenomenon where isotopically substituted molecules react at differing rates). Isotopic substitution affects only mass-dependent properties (e.g. vibrational frequencies), but has no effect on the values of atoms’ electronic states or the potential energy surface of a given reaction. Due to the greater mass of deuterium with respect to hydrogen, breaking the bonds holding various deuterated organic compounds together would require more energy, which is a potential problem because organisms have evolved in an environment that requires only enough energy allocation to break bonds between hydrogen and other atoms. In other words, organisms are not energetically adapted to catabolize organic compounds containing deuterium. A more pertinent potential problem, however, is the fact that the greater mass of deuterium with respect to hydrogen implies that the rate of metabolic reactions may be slower due to the decreased rate of bond-breaking in deuterated organic compounds, which is problematic due to the precise coordination and timing of metabolic reaction rates that organisms are adapted to and that are required to facilitate normative metabolism. It may thus be possible to deuterate an organism by a certain amount without witnessing significantly detrimental physiological effects, but the specific safety threshold would have to be determined through a variety of preclinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, incorporation of isotope-reinforced food and water has emerged as a novel means of promoting longevity and the maintenance of several aspects of health in eukaryotes [275]. Several teams have reported that the administration of deuterated water increases the lifespan of yeast in a dose-dependent manner by as much as 80% [275]. In multicellular eukaryotes, however, bodily incorporation of deuterated water above 20% begins to have toxic effects. Nonetheless, incorporation of deuterated water has been shown to either increase longevity or healthspan in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, rodents and humans [276–280], and has been found to have anti-cancer effects in rodents [280–282] and humans [283]. Such effects are thought to be the result of protection against DNA damage and mutation from ROS and exogenous mutagens. An intriguing alternative involves supplying organisms with food containing stable isotopes of carbon, e.g. 13C, [281, 282] which has a greater mass than 12C (which comprises the majority of natural carbon in organisms), but only ~8% greater than 12C, whereas deuterium has a mass 100% greater than hydrogen. This means that while the rate of bond breaking in the C-H bonds of organic compounds having 12C replaced with 13C would be slower, it may not be so slow as to disrupt the timing and coordination of metabolic reactions or to significantly affect the necessary energy allocation to catabolic reactions required for their ongoing maintenance. However, this would only be capable of potentially reducing the damaging effect of ionizing radiation for organic compounds like proteins, and not DNA because the hydrogen bonds occurring between DNA bases are N-H and O-H bonds rather than C-H bonds, and the problem of irradiation-induced DNA SSBs and DSBs in particular are much more detrimental than irradiation-induced damage to gene products. Furthermore, it is currently extremely costly to produce. It may, nonetheless, constitute an ancillary strategy for reducing the overall damaging effects of radiation to humans as it pertains to deep space exploration, provided that a less costly means of producing it could be developed.UTILIZING THE ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF RADIATION- AND AGING-INDUCED DAMAGE In recent years much progress has been made in the applications of artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning to biomarker development and drug discovery [284]. Deep neural networks (DNNs) were applied to profiling of the biological samples [285] predict the age of a patient using the basic clinical blood tests and identify the most important features [286]. Similar concepts can be applied to other data types including transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, photographic, activity and physiological data to evaluate the minute changes transpiring during aging or due to the irradiation in space. These minute changes can be addressed with the many interventions described in section VI. A prototype of such a system for monitoring a variety of data types over time called Young. AI was recently launched for testing (www.young.ai). Developing comprehensive predictors of age and accumulated damage using multiple data types on the population level and re-training them on the individual spacefarers is one of the approaches to build the artificially-intelligent health monitoring systems and assess the types of damage and the resulting changes that are difficult to predict with the amount of information available before the long-term exposure to radiation and a variety of other stress factors in space. Space colonists should also have the ability to engage in AI-enabled personalized drug discovery and rapid validation techniques. On Earth the drug discovery and development for a known indication takes many years and the likelihood of approval (LOA) of a drug from phase 1 to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval is 10.4% for all indications [287]. In space this process must be expedited and artificial intelligence can be employed to identify the effective molecules from the existing chemical space [288] or even generate novel molecular structures with the desired set of parameters [289].CONCLUSIONS We have outlined several alternative and complementary strategies for enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space exploration and colonization using existing biomedical and biotechnological tools and modalities in an attempt to lay the foundation for a comprehensive roadmap towards highly radioresistant humans. While many of the strategies proposed above may seem speculative, they should be considered as a foundation for future research directions. Meanwhile, we have highlighted the link between radioresistance and aging, and have endeavored to show how many of the biomedical and biotechnological modalities discussed in the present review could combinatorially be applied to both enhancing human radioresistance on the one hand and healthy longevity on the other. We also highlighted the need to converge and accelerate the research in radiobiology, biogerontology and AI to enable spacefarers to address the healthcare challenges we may not yet be aware of. Furthermore, given the massive amount of funding allocated to research into facilitating and optimizing space exploration and optimization, we hope to have shown how research into enhancing radioresistance for space exploration could galvanize progress in human healthspan extension, an area of research that is still massively underfunded despite its potential to prevent the massive economic burden posed by the future healthcare costs associated with demographic aging.Footnotes CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Ivan V.

    "abstract": "Abstract There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions. Keywords: brain, spaceflight, microgravity, proteomics",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Long-term deep space missions expose astronauts to an environment that is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during and after the course of mission activities. The hazards posed to normal tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), are not fully understood. The health risks of spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential neurodegenerative effects have long been a concern. Brain damage and degeneration can be promoted by many factors including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. There is some evidence that low-dose, space-relevant radiation induces changes in neuronal functions [1]. Microgravity induces intraocular pressure and vascular changes [2,3] and promotes apoptosis of astrocytes [4]. Spaceflight also induces cognitive and perceptual motor performance deterioration under stress [5]. Studies have shown that exposure to spaceflights has a strong impact on metabolic and stress response [6]. Collective evidence indicates that exposure to stressful spaceflight environments might induce changes in brain neuronal structure and function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and role of cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those stemming from the spaceflight environment, in facilitating brain damage and neurodegeneration have been studied less and remain unclear. Gray matter consists of neurons (i.e., it contains the cell bodies, dendrites and axon terminals of neurons), nerve fibers, astrocytes, microglia, and capillaries. Gray matter is closely associated with the functional domains of performance, locomotion, learning, memory and coordination. On the other hand, white matter consists mostly of oligodendroglial cells, myelinated axons and capillaries. White matter allows communication to and from gray matter areas, and between gray matter and the other parts of the body. It functions by transmitting the information from the different parts of the body towards the cerebral cortex. It modulates the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions [7]. Changes in gray matter are known to be primarily associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, with secondary effects on the white matter [8]. The deficits range from language ability to delayed memory and visuospatial construction. Disrupted white matter organization has been linked to poorer motor performance [9]. Studies have shown altered expressions of a number of genes and proteins involving a wide spectrum of biological functions following exposure to space environments. These alterations induced distinct changes specific to the regions of the brain [10]. Regional difference in stress response was also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray matter and white matter [11]. The purpose of the present investigation was to study spaceflight condition-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse gray matter and to compare these changes to those in white matter regions. Our unique data might provide new insights and improve risk assessment for future long-term space travel.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. STS-135 Flight Mice and Control Conditions Space Shuttle Atlantis, i.e., Space Transportation System 135 (STS-135), was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission in July of 2011. Female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Hollister, CA, USA) were flown in STS-135 using NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs). Mice were housed in two groups of five per AEM, separated by mesh wire. A set of ground controls (Ground AEMs) was housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at the KSC. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-h delayed telemetry data. All mice were under ambient temperatures of 26–28 °C with a 12-h day/night cycle during the flight. The mid deck CO2 levels that the mice were exposed to averaged 2150 parts per million (ppm) and ranged from a few hundred ppm while on the ground, before installation in the shuttle, to a maximum level of 3480 ppm in the shuttle during the mission. AEM controls were fed a special NASA food bar diet, the same as the space-flown mice. All mice received the same access to food and water ad libitum. The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was consulted but no protocol was required since tissues were only obtained after euthanasia. However, it should be noted that all NASA research with vertebrate animals is done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health (). The primary science team responsible for running the project obtained approval from the NASA Ames Research Center ACUC (NAS-11-002-Y1) on 5/31/2011. Upon return to Earth, animals were removed from the AEM nursing facility and assessed for survival and health. It was reported that all the mice survived the 13-day space mission. All animals were described by the inspecting personnel as being in good condition. 4.2. Dissection and Preservation of Mouse Brains Post Flight Within 3–5 h after landing, the mice were euthanized and the brains were removed (4–8 mice/group). As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI, USA) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanasia. Mice were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination via cardiac puncture. The whole brain hemispheres were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then rinsed with PBS and infiltrated overnight with 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C. Fixed samples were sent to Loma Linda University (LLU) via courier for analysis. As we were part of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team, we did not have access to all the tissues from all the mice. However, we received tissues from four flight mice and eight ground control mice. Tissue from two of the ground control samples were lost during processing, giving us a final sample size of n = 4 or 6 for flight and ground, respectively. 4.3. Brain Sectioning for Proteomic Analysis Paraffin-embedded brain sections were coronally gross sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm. After mounting and de-paraffinizing, six 3 mm diameter circular punches of tissue were obtained to provide three replicate samples each of white matter of the corpus callosum and gray matter of the cerebral cortex. Each tissue punch (disk) was transferred to a vial for individual processing (work up) by a modification of the methodology of Craven et al. [100]. When tissues are processed by the Craven method, formalin fixed tissues still yield 80% or more of the available proteins for proteomic analyses [100]. The preparation of the tissue samples for proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in this paper is described by the steps below. 4.4. Protein Extraction from Tissue We used boil-proof 1.7 mL low retention polypropylene snap-top vials to process the tissues. Lysis buffer was made by combining 50 μL each of stock solutions A and B, plus 10 μL of freshly prepared 1.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT). Solution A consisted of 300 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.2. Solution B was made by combining five liquid components: 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), glycerol, trifluorethanol, thiodiethanol, and water at the volumetric ratio of 3:2:1:1:3. Protein extraction was initiated by the addition of 110 μL lysis buffer to each vial containing a tissue punch (disk), followed by incubation for 30 min at 105 °C in a fume hood because of trifluorethanol toxicity. After cooling the vials were stored indefinitely at −80 °C. 4.5. Trypsin Digestion This was done using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL 30 kDa centrifugal filter devices (http://www.emdmillipore.com). A urea-ammonium bicarbonate buffer (UA) that is 50 mM with respect to ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and 8 M with respect to ultrapure urea (https://www.thermofisher.com) was prepared fresh on the day of use. The use of the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device has been outlined next. (a) To each vial after protein extraction (see above) 300 μL of UA were added and vortexed. The sample components were transferred to an Amicon Ultra, centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min, and the filtrate was discarded. (b) To complete the transfer initiated above and to continue the replacement of reagents from the protein extraction procedure described in 2.4 above with UA constituents, the above process was repeated twice using 400 μL UA each time, and both filtrates were discarded. (c) Next, 5 μL each of 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and 10 mM acrylamide and 200 μL UA were combined. The entire volume was then transferred to the Amicon Ultra, incubated for 30 min at ambient temperatures, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (d) The reagents were washed by the addition of 400 μL UA, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (e) The urea was washed out by the addition of 400 μL of 50 mM ABC, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. This process was repeated twice more. (f) Next, 200 μL of 50 mM ABC were added and a protein assay (Nanodrop, http://www.nanodrop.com, or Micro BCA, http://www.thermofisher.com) was performed on an aliquot. (g) A prepared trypsin digestion solution was added to the remaining protein in the Amicon Ultra. The 100 μL of 250 mM ABC were combined with 2.5 μL of 1% Promega PMax (http://promega.com) to give a 0.025% working solution plus sufficient sequencer-grade trypsin to result in an enzyme to protein ratio in the range of 1:25–50. (h) The solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C to convert the proteins to peptides. (i) The next morning, 150 μL of water was added, centrifuged, and the filtrate containing the peptides was collected. These steps were repeated using another 150 μL water and the filtrates were combined. (j) Next, 20 µL of 10% TFA were added to the combined filtrates to destroy the PMax. (k) The filtrate was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a volume of 100 μL and stored at −80 °C. (l) Just prior to MS analysis, a 2–5 μg portion of each protein/peptide sample was purified with a Zip-tip C18 P10 (http://www.emdmillipore.com). The sample preparations from each set of the three replicate “punches” were pooled, resulting in a total of 20 samples for MS analysis. 4.6. MS Analyses and Data Processing An Easy-nLC system with an autosampler was attached to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (http://thermoscientificbio.com). This was used for all MS analyses utilizing 2 to 2.5 µg peptide loadings after zip-tip purification. After injection, the 5 µL peptide samples in 0.25% TFA were passed through a 2 cm × 100 μm C18, of 5 μm particle size, precolumn (http://thermoscientificbio.com) in series with a 10 cm × 75 μm in-house-prepared capillary column packed with Microm Magic C18 of 5 μ particle size (http://www.michrom.com/) for separation and elution. A 2-h gradient was used (Solvent A 0.1% FA in water, Solvent B 0.1% FA in ACN, 5–30% Solvent B). Collision-induced disassociation was used to fragment the top 10 most abundant ions and the MS/MS spectra were collected between 250 and 1500 m/z, following the parent full-scan mass spectrum collected at 60,000 resolution. The raw data files from these analyses were processed first through Proteome Discoverer (http://thermoscientificbio.com) for precursor intensity with the following search parameters using the mouse Uniprot/Swissprot database: 2 missed trypsin cleavages allowed, dynamic oxidation on methionine, deamidation on asparagine and glutamine, and static proprionamide attachment on cysteine. In parallel, the data processing was performed using our DeMix Q algorithm. Briefly, DeMix “unmixes” the MS/MS events that become frequently but accidentally multiplexed because more than one (up to four) precursor ions are selected for fragmentation within the same m/z window simultaneously [101]. DeMix allows one to identify more peptides on average than there were precursors selected for MS/MS. For extension of the peptide identity “between the runs” and thus additionally increase the number of identified peptides while simultaneously improving quantification accuracy, we used DeMix Q [102], an extension of the DeMix algorithm that employs the scoring of identity transfer. Further improvement in quantification accuracy can be achieved with the help of our Diffacto algorithm [103] that selects for protein quantification of only “well-behaved” peptides. All spread sheets with protein relative abundances were then exported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa). In IPA, only direct relationships were allowed in the general settings and genes. Endogenous chemical interactions and causal networks were both included. All items were selected under data sources, confidence, species and mutation.",

In the white matter, there was a strong trend for a downregulation of functions related to the formation of cellular protrusions (Z = −1.98). In the gray matter, there was a significant downregulation of functions related to overall organismal death and organ degeneration (Z < −2.0). There were also strong trends for downregulation in cellular and neural degenerative functions (Z = −1.98).

    "discussion": "3. Discussion While there do not appear to be enough significantly different proteins in either white or gray matter in this analysis to appear as a significantly activated canonical pathway, there still appear to be common functional themes: (1) synaptic function, (2) intracellular communication, (3) metabolism, (4) oxidative stress and tissue damage responses, and (5) activation of catecholamines. 3.1. Synaptic Function: Plasticity, Vesicles and Dendritic Spines In the white matter there were three proteins related to synaptic plasticity that were upregulated. Calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2δ1 (CACNA2D1) is intimately involved in calcium channel trafficking [12] and regulates excitatory synapse formation during development or after injury [13]. PTPRF interacting protein α 3 (PPFIA3, also known as Liprin-α-3) is typically found to be co-expressed with a variety of pre-synaptic proteins in neurons but has also been found in astrocytes [14,15]. It is thought to be involved in presynaptic plasticity and synaptic vesicle release, particularly in excitatory synapses [15,16]. Myosin VA (MYO5A) is an F-actin-based motor protein that is also important in the generation and movement of synaptic vesicles. It has been found in dendritic spines and synaptic vesicles and appears to be critical for synaptic plasticity and organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [17]). Several proteins associated with synaptic function that are upregulated in the gray matter after flight involve vesicle formation, exocytosis and endocytosis. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that is expressed in most neurons [18] and is a critical component of synaptic vesicle formation and exocytosis [19,20]. DNAJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5) is a pre-synaptic DNAJ C-class Hsp40 co-chaperone that is primarily expressed in the brain and retina (reviewed in [21]). It is part of a complex of proteins that resides on synaptic vesicles and chaperones pre-synaptic SNARE proteins, making it critical during repeated synaptic vesicle cycles [22]. Indeed, DNAJC5 knockout mice have progressive, age-dependent sensorimotor deficits and the protein appears to be critical to preventing pre-synaptic degeneration via deficits in endocytosis [21,23]. Upregulated within gray matter, dynamin 3 (DNM3) is expressed in the dendritic spines and is primarily associated with regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling [24,25,26]. There are three isoforms of dynamin that share about 80% overall homology and have mostly redundant roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane fission [24,27]. The SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2, also known as endophilin-1) is a potential tumor suppressor gene [28] that is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in presynaptic ganglion [29]. However, the primary function of this protein is to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (reviewed in [30]). Finally, while not directly related to neuronal communication, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit A1 (ATP6V0A1) involves a form of endocytosis in microglia. This protein that was upregulated in gray matter, is involved with the merging of lysosomes and phagosomes during phagocytosis in the brain [31]. Interestingly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was significantly and highly upregulated in the liver of these mice as well [32], suggesting a systemic response. In addition to vesicle formation, several of the proteins upregulated in gray matter after spaceflight have been implicated in neurite and dendritic spine formation. Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (YWHAE) is believed to play a critical role during neuronal development and migration [33] and neurite formation during cortical development [34]. Over expression of this gene disrupts neurite formation through the microtubule binding protein, doublecortin [34]. Enolase 2 (ENO2) has also been shown to have neurotrophic activity [35] and is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and neurite regeneration [36]. Similarly, both dynamin 3 (DNM3) [37] and SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2) [38] that were upregulated in gray matter are involved with dendritic spine morphogenesis and stability. Another upregulated protein in the gray matter is actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1). Expressed in the dendritic spines of the post-synaptic density (PSD) [39,40], this protein is an actin-crosslinking protein [41] that is involved with synaptic plasticity [39]. This is interesting because changes in dendrite activity might be related to synaptic plasticity [42,43]. Consistent with the upregulation of proteins related to neurite and dendrite growth is the downregulation of SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, a vesicle trafficking protein) in the gray matter. Knocking down this protein using siRNA reduced neurite length had no impact on neuronal migration [44]. 3.2. Intracellular Communication: Myelination and Protein/Organelle Transport Another broad category impacted by spaceflight is involved in intracellular communication. Specifically, (1) axonal signaling that is “insulated” via myelin and (2) protein and organelle transport. Downregulated in the murine white matter, myelin basic protein (MBP) has an important role in the process of myelination of axons, particularly in the adhesion of myelin layers between cytosolic surfaces [45,46]. MBP is implicated in auto-immune responses within the human CNS, and is thought to be a target for T cell activity in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating or degenerative disorders. Its reduction over an extended period is usually associated with glial inflammation activation and proliferation, leading to reactive astrocytosis [47,48]. Interestingly, three important factors found in oligodendrocytes and involved in myelin formation were upregulated in the gray matter: acyl-coenzyme A, a cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) [49]; 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) [50,51]; and neurofilament light (NEFL) [52,53]. Two components of protein/organelle transport were upregulated in the white matter. As stated previously, myosin VA (MYO5A) is important for organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [17]). Similarly, dynein light chain LC8-type 2 (DYNLL2, also known as DLC2), originally identified as part of the microtubule-based motor protein dynein [54], is involved with transporting mitochondria along the axons of neurons in response to local energy and metabolic requirements [55]. However, DYNLL2 has also been shown to have a variety of other targets including nNOS, post synaptic scaffolding proteins, and pro-apoptotic proteins [54]. However, there were also two factors involved in protein transport that were downregulated in white matter. Vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) is a component of the “cargo recognition complex” of the retromer complex responsible for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane [56,57]. Already mentioned above as an important component of myelin, MBP also interacts with the cytoskeleton and/or tight junctions, making it critical for communicating extracellular signaling to the inside of the cell [46]. Decreases in MBP have been associated with glial activation [58]. 3.3. Metabolism: Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Function Consistent with our previous results, in the liver and skin of the same mice in which we found that spaceflight had a major impact on metabolism [32,59,60], the next broad category involved the impact of spaceflight on the brain, including glycolysis and metabolism. Two proteins involved in glycolysis or metabolism were altered by spaceflight in the white matter. This first one was upregulated. Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α (PITPNA) is involved with coordinating lipid metabolism and signaling [61], transferring phospholipids out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into other membranes [62]. Interestingly, an increase in oxidative stress has been shown to cause a decrease in this protein, particularly in the brains of aged or Parkinson’s disease models [63]. This lack has been associated with neurodegenerative disease, which has been linked to changes in glucose homeostasis [64]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an abundant enzyme in brain tissue that is critical to energy metabolism and glycolysis [65]. In conditions of oxidative stress, GAPDH activity is impaired, leading to cellular aging and apoptosis [65]. This enzyme can undergo sulfhydration, S-nitrosylation and oxidation, which, in turn, can lead to memory loss, apoptotic cell death and neurodegeneration, noted in ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease models [66,67,68]. In the gray matter, enolase 2 (ENO2) was upregulated after flight, also suggesting glycolysis may be impacted. ENO2 is a glycolytic enzyme [69] found in neurons, neuroendocrine cells and microglia [69,70]. However, one of the few proteins that were downregulated in the gray matter, SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, vesicle trafficking protein), also complexes with SNARE proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [44,71]. Knocking down this protein using siRNA had no impact on exocytosis [44]. Instead, SEC22B interacted with lipid transfer proteins, a factor which, when inhibited, has been shown to result in changes in lipid metabolism and transfer [44]. Simultaneously, four proteins critical to mitochondrial function were also upregulated in the gray matter. The mitochondrial localized enzyme, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), has been linked to cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism [72,73] and can be found in axons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [49]. Dynamin 1-like (DNM1L) is critical to mitochondrial fission [74]. This protein drives mitochondrial division by self-assembling into filaments that constrict around the organelle [75]. The 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) can also be found in the inner membranes of mitochondria [76] and is important for Ca2+ transport [77]. Interestingly CNP levels decreased in non-synaptic mitochondria in the brains of old rats [77]. An increase in CNP release suggests mitochondria may be in a calcium-overloaded condition [78]. Inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT), also known as MIC60 and mitofilin, is important for protein translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, regulating both morphology and protein biogenesis [79]. Even though the tissues were collected and prepared for analysis less than five hours after landing, it is possible that the changes in proteins related to metabolism are simply a response to the landing and do not reflect changes in the spaceflight environment. To confirm or deny this possibility would require that mice be euthanized in orbit and tissues immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Indeed, such studies have already been planned. However, in our previous study examining the livers of these same mice, there were significant changes in lipid metabolism indicative of a pre-diabetic state that seems to suggest a long-term effect rather than an acute response due to landing [32,59,80]. 3.4. Oxidative Stress and Tissue Damage Responses The changes noted in metabolism are likely related to increases in proteins involved with oxidative stress and inflammation in the white matter. Arginase 1 (ARG1), which was highly upregulated, is an important enzyme of the urea cycle that is generally found in the liver and is critical to removing ammonia from the body [81]. However, ARG1+ is also commonly expressed by alternatively-activated macrophages and microglia [82], which tend to be anti-inflammatory. In the brain, ARG1+ microglia have been implicated in amyloid beta plaque removal [83]. Furthermore, it is important to nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in microvascular endothelial cells [84]. In activated macrophages, ARG1+ competes with NO synthase (NOS) for their common substrate, l-arginine, leading to a reduction in NO production [85]. Not surprisingly, many of the mitochondrial proteins that were upregulated in the gray matter are also involved in the oxidative stress response. ACAT1 expression has been shown to be elevated during conditions of oxidative stress [49]. Mutations in DNM1L often result in death associated with oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration [75,86]. In vitro, deleting DNML1 from Purkinje cells resulted in increased oxidative damage via the peroxidation of proteins and lipids [75]. Decreases in IMMT appear to result in increases in ROS levels [87] and seem to be an anti-apoptotic protein important for the regulation of cytochrome c release [87,88,89]. Interestingly, the oxidative damage due to lipid peroxidation found in the interfibrillar mitochondria of diabetic heart tissue was reduced by overexpressing IMMT [90,91]. Increases in the above oxidative stress factors are consistent with the decreases noted in another mitochondrial protein, UQCRB (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein), a subunit of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [92] of the gray matter. UQCRB is important in mediating mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are both independent of NADPH oxidase and important for angiogenesis [93]. Drugs which inhibit the activity of UQCRB reduce the ROS produced by the mitochondria [92,93,94]. Although not found in mitochondria, Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is also upregulated in the gray matter. QDPR is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). This is important because BH4 is a critical co-factor in the generation of all three NO synthases, iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS [95]. In quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR)−/− knockout mice, the biomarkers of folate-dependent oxidative stress such as ophthalamate, spermine, and γ-Glu-Cys all appeared to be elevated [95]. Given the changes in markers indicative of oxidative stress, it should not be surprising that there were also changes in proteins related to cell damage and death. In the gray matter, at least four upregulated proteins dealing with intracellular damage and/or cell death appeared to be involved. This is consistent with the IPA analysis that found changes in proteins related to organismal death, degeneration of cells, and neurodegeneration. ATP6V0A1 is critically important in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion [96]. DNAJC5 appears to have some influence on protein folding and endosomal autophagy, depending on the presence of SGT and Hsc70 [97]. ACAT1 is instrumental in induction of necroptosis through lipid droplet formation that has been demonstrated to be the initial key event in cell death [98]. Finally, CNP appears to play a role with caspase-independent apoptosis [99]. 3.5. Activation of Catecholamines Finally, there were several changes in the white matter involved in sympathetic activity and catecholamine production. As mentioned previously, CACNA2D1 was upregulated in the white matter. Although we did not specifically look at areas within the brain, this protein is active in the periventricular nucleus (PVN) and is involved with sympathetic outflow [13]. This is interesting because two proteins involved with sympathetic responses were also upregulated in the gray matter. Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). BH4 is a critical co-factor in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin [95]. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is expressed in endocrine cells [18] and STX1A knockout mice had decreased circulating levels of the stress hormones, CRH and ACTH, as well as serotonergic precursors [18].",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions In summary, this study is the first to identify spaceflight-induced proteomic significance and biomarkers in the gray and white matter of the murine brain. These unique “proteomic signatures” of brain tissue may provide new mechanistic insight into the complex biological response to space environment. We propose that spaceflight conditions induce changes in neuronal structure, cellular function, oxidative response, mitochondrial function and metabolism, which, in turn, might lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. The diverse changes in protein expression profiles in white and gray matter in response to spaceflight conditions warrants further investigation. Further studies are also necessary to elucidate the possible tissue and functional impact responsible for our findings and to identify effective countermeasures.",

Copyright notice ID: 6337482 PMID: 30577490 Abstract There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions. Keywords: brain, spaceflight, microgravity, proteomics1. Introduction Long-term deep space missions expose astronauts to an environment that is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during and after the course of mission activities. The hazards posed to normal tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS), are not fully understood. The health risks of spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential neurodegenerative effects have long been a concern. Brain damage and degeneration can be promoted by many factors including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. There is some evidence that low-dose, space-relevant radiation induces changes in neuronal functions [1]. Microgravity induces intraocular pressure and vascular changes [2,3] and promotes apoptosis of astrocytes [4]. Spaceflight also induces cognitive and perceptual motor performance deterioration under stress [5]. Studies have shown that exposure to spaceflights has a strong impact on metabolic and stress response [6]. Collective evidence indicates that exposure to stressful spaceflight environments might induce changes in brain neuronal structure and function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and role of cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those stemming from the spaceflight environment, in facilitating brain damage and neurodegeneration have been studied less and remain unclear. Gray matter consists of neurons (i.e., it contains the cell bodies, dendrites and axon terminals of neurons), nerve fibers, astrocytes, microglia, and capillaries. Gray matter is closely associated with the functional domains of performance, locomotion, learning, memory and coordination. On the other hand, white matter consists mostly of oligodendroglial cells, myelinated axons and capillaries. White matter allows communication to and from gray matter areas, and between gray matter and the other parts of the body. It functions by transmitting the information from the different parts of the body towards the cerebral cortex. It modulates the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions [7]. Changes in gray matter are known to be primarily associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, with secondary effects on the white matter [8]. The deficits range from language ability to delayed memory and visuospatial construction. Disrupted white matter organization has been linked to poorer motor performance [9]. Studies have shown altered expressions of a number of genes and proteins involving a wide spectrum of biological functions following exposure to space environments. These alterations induced distinct changes specific to the regions of the brain [10]. Regional difference in stress response was also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray matter and white matter [11]. The purpose of the present investigation was to study spaceflight condition-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse gray matter and to compare these changes to those in white matter regions. Our unique data might provide new insights and improve risk assessment for future long-term space travel.2. Results There were nine and 17 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the white (Table 1) and gray (Table 2) matter, respectively (p < 0.05, log fold change >1.0 or <−1.0). In general, proteins that were significantly altered were upregulated in both areas of the brain. However, there was no overlap between the brain area data sets. If log fold change constraints were reduced to >0.5, the number of proteins increased to 16 and 25 for white and gray matter, respectively. Table 1.

However, there were strong trends for changes in functionally related proteins in both brain regions (Table 3). In the white matter, there was a strong trend for a downregulation of functions related to the formation of cellular protrusions (Z = −1.98). In the gray matter, there was a significant downregulation of functions related to overall organismal death and organ degeneration (Z < −2.0). There were also strong trends for downregulation in cellular and neural degenerative functions (Z = −1.98). Interestingly, there was a significant upregulation in functions related to viral infection (Z > 2.0). Table 3.

Discussion While there do not appear to be enough significantly different proteins in either white or gray matter in this analysis to appear as a significantly activated canonical pathway, there still appear to be common functional themes: (1) synaptic function, (2) intracellular communication, (3) metabolism, (4) oxidative stress and tissue damage responses, and (5) activation of catecholamines. 3.1. Synaptic Function: Plasticity, Vesicles and Dendritic Spines In the white matter there were three proteins related to synaptic plasticity that were upregulated. Calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2δ1 (CACNA2D1) is intimately involved in calcium channel trafficking [12] and regulates excitatory synapse formation during development or after injury [13]. PTPRF interacting protein α 3 (PPFIA3, also known as Liprin-α-3) is typically found to be co-expressed with a variety of pre-synaptic proteins in neurons but has also been found in astrocytes [14,15]. It is thought to be involved in presynaptic plasticity and synaptic vesicle release, particularly in excitatory synapses [15,16]. Myosin VA (MYO5A) is an F-actin-based motor protein that is also important in the generation and movement of synaptic vesicles. It has been found in dendritic spines and synaptic vesicles and appears to be critical for synaptic plasticity and organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [17]). Several proteins associated with synaptic function that are upregulated in the gray matter after flight involve vesicle formation, exocytosis and endocytosis. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that is expressed in most neurons [18] and is a critical component of synaptic vesicle formation and exocytosis [19,20]. DNAJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5) is a pre-synaptic DNAJ C-class Hsp40 co-chaperone that is primarily expressed in the brain and retina (reviewed in [21]). It is part of a complex of proteins that resides on synaptic vesicles and chaperones pre-synaptic SNARE proteins, making it critical during repeated synaptic vesicle cycles [22]. Indeed, DNAJC5 knockout mice have progressive, age-dependent sensorimotor deficits and the protein appears to be critical to preventing pre-synaptic degeneration via deficits in endocytosis [21,23]. Upregulated within gray matter, dynamin 3 (DNM3) is expressed in the dendritic spines and is primarily associated with regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling [24,25,26]. There are three isoforms of dynamin that share about 80% overall homology and have mostly redundant roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane fission [24,27]. The SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2, also known as endophilin-1) is a potential tumor suppressor gene [28] that is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in presynaptic ganglion [29]. However, the primary function of this protein is to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (reviewed in [30]). Finally, while not directly related to neuronal communication, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit A1 (ATP6V0A1) involves a form of endocytosis in microglia. This protein that was upregulated in gray matter, is involved with the merging of lysosomes and phagosomes during phagocytosis in the brain [31]. Interestingly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was significantly and highly upregulated in the liver of these mice as well [32], suggesting a systemic response. In addition to vesicle formation, several of the proteins upregulated in gray matter after spaceflight have been implicated in neurite and dendritic spine formation. Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (YWHAE) is believed to play a critical role during neuronal development and migration [33] and neurite formation during cortical development [34]. Over expression of this gene disrupts neurite formation through the microtubule binding protein, doublecortin [34]. Enolase 2 (ENO2) has also been shown to have neurotrophic activity [35] and is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and neurite regeneration [36]. Similarly, both dynamin 3 (DNM3) [37] and SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2) [38] that were upregulated in gray matter are involved with dendritic spine morphogenesis and stability. Another upregulated protein in the gray matter is actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1). Expressed in the dendritic spines of the post-synaptic density (PSD) [39,40], this protein is an actin-crosslinking protein [41] that is involved with synaptic plasticity [39]. This is interesting because changes in dendrite activity might be related to synaptic plasticity [42,43]. Consistent with the upregulation of proteins related to neurite and dendrite growth is the downregulation of SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, a vesicle trafficking protein) in the gray matter. Knocking down this protein using siRNA reduced neurite length had no impact on neuronal migration [44].3.2. Intracellular Communication: Myelination and Protein/Organelle Transport Another broad category impacted by spaceflight is involved in intracellular communication. Specifically, (1) axonal signaling that is “insulated” via myelin and (2) protein and organelle transport. Downregulated in the murine white matter, myelin basic protein (MBP) has an important role in the process of myelination of axons, particularly in the adhesion of myelin layers between cytosolic surfaces [45,46]. MBP is implicated in auto-immune responses within the human CNS, and is thought to be a target for T cell activity in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating or degenerative disorders. Its reduction over an extended period is usually associated with glial inflammation activation and proliferation, leading to reactive astrocytosis [47,48]. Interestingly, three important factors found in oligodendrocytes and involved in myelin formation were upregulated in the gray matter: acyl-coenzyme A, a cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) [49]; 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) [50,51]; and neurofilament light (NEFL) [52,53]. Two components of protein/organelle transport were upregulated in the white matter. As stated previously, myosin VA (MYO5A) is important for organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [17]). Similarly, dynein light chain LC8-type 2 (DYNLL2, also known as DLC2), originally identified as part of the microtubule-based motor protein dynein [54], is involved with transporting mitochondria along the axons of neurons in response to local energy and metabolic requirements [55]. However, DYNLL2 has also been shown to have a variety of other targets including nNOS, post synaptic scaffolding proteins, and pro-apoptotic proteins [54]. However, there were also two factors involved in protein transport that were downregulated in white matter. Vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) is a component of the “cargo recognition complex” of the retromer complex responsible for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane [56,57]. Already mentioned above as an important component of myelin, MBP also interacts with the cytoskeleton and/or tight junctions, making it critical for communicating extracellular signaling to the inside of the cell [46]. Decreases in MBP have been associated with glial activation [58].3.3. Metabolism: Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Function Consistent with our previous results, in the liver and skin of the same mice in which we found that spaceflight had a major impact on metabolism [32,59,60], the next broad category involved the impact of spaceflight on the brain, including glycolysis and metabolism. Two proteins involved in glycolysis or metabolism were altered by spaceflight in the white matter. This first one was upregulated. Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α (PITPNA) is involved with coordinating lipid metabolism and signaling [61], transferring phospholipids out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into other membranes [62]. Interestingly, an increase in oxidative stress has been shown to cause a decrease in this protein, particularly in the brains of aged or Parkinson’s disease models [63]. This lack has been associated with neurodegenerative disease, which has been linked to changes in glucose homeostasis [64]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an abundant enzyme in brain tissue that is critical to energy metabolism and glycolysis [65]. In conditions of oxidative stress, GAPDH activity is impaired, leading to cellular aging and apoptosis [65]. This enzyme can undergo sulfhydration, S-nitrosylation and oxidation, which, in turn, can lead to memory loss, apoptotic cell death and neurodegeneration, noted in ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease models [66,67,68]. In the gray matter, enolase 2 (ENO2) was upregulated after flight, also suggesting glycolysis may be impacted. ENO2 is a glycolytic enzyme [69] found in neurons, neuroendocrine cells and microglia [69,70]. However, one of the few proteins that were downregulated in the gray matter, SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, vesicle trafficking protein), also complexes with SNARE proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [44,71]. Knocking down this protein using siRNA had no impact on exocytosis [44]. Instead, SEC22B interacted with lipid transfer proteins, a factor which, when inhibited, has been shown to result in changes in lipid metabolism and transfer [44]. Simultaneously, four proteins critical to mitochondrial function were also upregulated in the gray matter. The mitochondrial localized enzyme, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), has been linked to cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism [72,73] and can be found in axons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [49]. Dynamin 1-like (DNM1L) is critical to mitochondrial fission [74]. This protein drives mitochondrial division by self-assembling into filaments that constrict around the organelle [75]. The 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) can also be found in the inner membranes of mitochondria [76] and is important for Ca2+ transport [77]. Interestingly CNP levels decreased in non-synaptic mitochondria in the brains of old rats [77]. An increase in CNP release suggests mitochondria may be in a calcium-overloaded condition [78]. Inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT), also known as MIC60 and mitofilin, is important for protein translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, regulating both morphology and protein biogenesis [79]. Even though the tissues were collected and prepared for analysis less than five hours after landing, it is possible that the changes in proteins related to metabolism are simply a response to the landing and do not reflect changes in the spaceflight environment. To confirm or deny this possibility would require that mice be euthanized in orbit and tissues immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Indeed, such studies have already been planned. However, in our previous study examining the livers of these same mice, there were significant changes in lipid metabolism indicative of a pre-diabetic state that seems to suggest a long-term effect rather than an acute response due to landing [32,59,80].3.4. Oxidative Stress and Tissue Damage Responses The changes noted in metabolism are likely related to increases in proteins involved with oxidative stress and inflammation in the white matter. Arginase 1 (ARG1), which was highly upregulated, is an important enzyme of the urea cycle that is generally found in the liver and is critical to removing ammonia from the body [81]. However, ARG1+ is also commonly expressed by alternatively-activated macrophages and microglia [82], which tend to be anti-inflammatory. In the brain, ARG1+ microglia have been implicated in amyloid beta plaque removal [83]. Furthermore, it is important to nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in microvascular endothelial cells [84]. In activated macrophages, ARG1+ competes with NO synthase (NOS) for their common substrate, l-arginine, leading to a reduction in NO production [85]. Not surprisingly, many of the mitochondrial proteins that were upregulated in the gray matter are also involved in the oxidative stress response. ACAT1 expression has been shown to be elevated during conditions of oxidative stress [49]. Mutations in DNM1L often result in death associated with oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration [75,86]. In vitro, deleting DNML1 from Purkinje cells resulted in increased oxidative damage via the peroxidation of proteins and lipids [75]. Decreases in IMMT appear to result in increases in ROS levels [87] and seem to be an anti-apoptotic protein important for the regulation of cytochrome c release [87,88,89]. Interestingly, the oxidative damage due to lipid peroxidation found in the interfibrillar mitochondria of diabetic heart tissue was reduced by overexpressing IMMT [90,91]. Increases in the above oxidative stress factors are consistent with the decreases noted in another mitochondrial protein, UQCRB (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein), a subunit of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [92] of the gray matter. UQCRB is important in mediating mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are both independent of NADPH oxidase and important for angiogenesis [93]. Drugs which inhibit the activity of UQCRB reduce the ROS produced by the mitochondria [92,93,94]. Although not found in mitochondria, Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is also upregulated in the gray matter. QDPR is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). This is important because BH4 is a critical co-factor in the generation of all three NO synthases, iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS [95]. In quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR)−/− knockout mice, the biomarkers of folate-dependent oxidative stress such as ophthalamate, spermine, and γ-Glu-Cys all appeared to be elevated [95]. Given the changes in markers indicative of oxidative stress, it should not be surprising that there were also changes in proteins related to cell damage and death. In the gray matter, at least four upregulated proteins dealing with intracellular damage and/or cell death appeared to be involved. This is consistent with the IPA analysis that found changes in proteins related to organismal death, degeneration of cells, and neurodegeneration. ATP6V0A1 is critically important in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion [96]. DNAJC5 appears to have some influence on protein folding and endosomal autophagy, depending on the presence of SGT and Hsc70 [97]. ACAT1 is instrumental in induction of necroptosis through lipid droplet formation that has been demonstrated to be the initial key event in cell death [98]. Finally, CNP appears to play a role with caspase-independent apoptosis [99].3.5. Activation of Catecholamines Finally, there were several changes in the white matter involved in sympathetic activity and catecholamine production. As mentioned previously, CACNA2D1 was upregulated in the white matter. Although we did not specifically look at areas within the brain, this protein is active in the periventricular nucleus (PVN) and is involved with sympathetic outflow [13]. This is interesting because two proteins involved with sympathetic responses were also upregulated in the gray matter. Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). BH4 is a critical co-factor in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin [95]. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is expressed in endocrine cells [18] and STX1A knockout mice had decreased circulating levels of the stress hormones, CRH and ACTH, as well as serotonergic precursors [18].4. Materials and Methods 4.1. STS-135 Flight Mice and Control Conditions Space Shuttle Atlantis, i.e., Space Transportation System 135 (STS-135), was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission in July of 2011. Female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Hollister, CA, USA) were flown in STS-135 using NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs). Mice were housed in two groups of five per AEM, separated by mesh wire. A set of ground controls (Ground AEMs) was housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at the KSC. Ground AEM control mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on 48-h delayed telemetry data. All mice were under ambient temperatures of 26–28 °C with a 12-h day/night cycle during the flight. The mid deck CO2 levels that the mice were exposed to averaged 2150 parts per million (ppm) and ranged from a few hundred ppm while on the ground, before installation in the shuttle, to a maximum level of 3480 ppm in the shuttle during the mission. AEM controls were fed a special NASA food bar diet, the same as the space-flown mice. All mice received the same access to food and water ad libitum. The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was consulted but no protocol was required since tissues were only obtained after euthanasia. However, it should be noted that all NASA research with vertebrate animals is done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health (). The primary science team responsible for running the project obtained approval from the NASA Ames Research Center ACUC (NAS-11-002-Y1) on 5/31/2011. Upon return to Earth, animals were removed from the AEM nursing facility and assessed for survival and health. It was reported that all the mice survived the 13-day space mission. All animals were described by the inspecting personnel as being in good condition.4.2. Dissection and Preservation of Mouse Brains Post Flight Within 3–5 h after landing, the mice were euthanized and the brains were removed (4–8 mice/group). As part of the primary science, all mice underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometry (Piximus, Inc., Fitchburg, WI, USA) immediately prior to anesthesia and euthanasia. Mice were anesthetized with 3–5% isoflurane and euthanized with 100% CO2 and exsanguination via cardiac puncture. The whole brain hemispheres were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then rinsed with PBS and infiltrated overnight with 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C. Fixed samples were sent to Loma Linda University (LLU) via courier for analysis. As we were part of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team, we did not have access to all the tissues from all the mice. However, we received tissues from four flight mice and eight ground control mice. Tissue from two of the ground control samples were lost during processing, giving us a final sample size of n = 4 or 6 for flight and ground, respectively.4.3. Brain Sectioning for Proteomic Analysis Paraffin-embedded brain sections were coronally gross sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm. After mounting and de-paraffinizing, six 3 mm diameter circular punches of tissue were obtained to provide three replicate samples each of white matter of the corpus callosum and gray matter of the cerebral cortex. Each tissue punch (disk) was transferred to a vial for individual processing (work up) by a modification of the methodology of Craven et al. [100]. When tissues are processed by the Craven method, formalin fixed tissues still yield 80% or more of the available proteins for proteomic analyses [100]. The preparation of the tissue samples for proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in this paper is described by the steps below.4.4. Protein Extraction from Tissue We used boil-proof 1.7 mL low retention polypropylene snap-top vials to process the tissues. Lysis buffer was made by combining 50 μL each of stock solutions A and B, plus 10 μL of freshly prepared 1.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT). Solution A consisted of 300 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.2. Solution B was made by combining five liquid components: 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), glycerol, trifluorethanol, thiodiethanol, and water at the volumetric ratio of 3:2:1:1:3. Protein extraction was initiated by the addition of 110 μL lysis buffer to each vial containing a tissue punch (disk), followed by incubation for 30 min at 105 °C in a fume hood because of trifluorethanol toxicity. After cooling the vials were stored indefinitely at −80 °C.4.5. Trypsin Digestion This was done using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL 30 kDa centrifugal filter devices (http://www.emdmillipore.com). A urea-ammonium bicarbonate buffer (UA) that is 50 mM with respect to ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and 8 M with respect to ultrapure urea (https://www.thermofisher.com) was prepared fresh on the day of use. The use of the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device has been outlined next. (a) To each vial after protein extraction (see above) 300 μL of UA were added and vortexed. The sample components were transferred to an Amicon Ultra, centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min, and the filtrate was discarded. (b) To complete the transfer initiated above and to continue the replacement of reagents from the protein extraction procedure described in 2.4 above with UA constituents, the above process was repeated twice using 400 μL UA each time, and both filtrates were discarded. (c) Next, 5 μL each of 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and 10 mM acrylamide and 200 μL UA were combined. The entire volume was then transferred to the Amicon Ultra, incubated for 30 min at ambient temperatures, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (d) The reagents were washed by the addition of 400 μL UA, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (e) The urea was washed out by the addition of 400 μL of 50 mM ABC, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. This process was repeated twice more. (f) Next, 200 μL of 50 mM ABC were added and a protein assay (Nanodrop, http://www.nanodrop.com, or Micro BCA, http://www.thermofisher.com) was performed on an aliquot. (g) A prepared trypsin digestion solution was added to the remaining protein in the Amicon Ultra. The 100 μL of 250 mM ABC were combined with 2.5 μL of 1% Promega PMax (http://promega.com) to give a 0.025% working solution plus sufficient sequencer-grade trypsin to result in an enzyme to protein ratio in the range of 1:25–50. (h) The solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C to convert the proteins to peptides. (i) The next morning, 150 μL of water was added, centrifuged, and the filtrate containing the peptides was collected. These steps were repeated using another 150 μL water and the filtrates were combined. (j) Next, 20 µL of 10% TFA were added to the combined filtrates to destroy the PMax. (k) The filtrate was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a volume of 100 μL and stored at −80 °C. (l) Just prior to MS analysis, a 2–5 μg portion of each protein/peptide sample was purified with a Zip-tip C18 P10 (http://www.emdmillipore.com). The sample preparations from each set of the three replicate “punches” were pooled, resulting in a total of 20 samples for MS analysis.4.6. MS Analyses and Data Processing An Easy-nLC system with an autosampler was attached to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (http://thermoscientificbio.com). This was used for all MS analyses utilizing 2 to 2.5 µg peptide loadings after zip-tip purification. After injection, the 5 µL peptide samples in 0.25% TFA were passed through a 2 cm × 100 μm C18, of 5 μm particle size, precolumn (http://thermoscientificbio.com) in series with a 10 cm × 75 μm in-house-prepared capillary column packed with Microm Magic C18 of 5 μ particle size (http://www.michrom.com/) for separation and elution. A 2-h gradient was used (Solvent A 0.1% FA in water, Solvent B 0.1% FA in ACN, 5–30% Solvent B). Collision-induced disassociation was used to fragment the top 10 most abundant ions and the MS/MS spectra were collected between 250 and 1500 m/z, following the parent full-scan mass spectrum collected at 60,000 resolution. The raw data files from these analyses were processed first through Proteome Discoverer (http://thermoscientificbio.com) for precursor intensity with the following search parameters using the mouse Uniprot/Swissprot database: 2 missed trypsin cleavages allowed, dynamic oxidation on methionine, deamidation on asparagine and glutamine, and static proprionamide attachment on cysteine. In parallel, the data processing was performed using our DeMix Q algorithm. Briefly, DeMix “unmixes” the MS/MS events that become frequently but accidentally multiplexed because more than one (up to four) precursor ions are selected for fragmentation within the same m/z window simultaneously [101]. DeMix allows one to identify more peptides on average than there were precursors selected for MS/MS. For extension of the peptide identity “between the runs” and thus additionally increase the number of identified peptides while simultaneously improving quantification accuracy, we used DeMix Q [102], an extension of the DeMix algorithm that employs the scoring of identity transfer. Further improvement in quantification accuracy can be achieved with the help of our Diffacto algorithm [103] that selects for protein quantification of only “well-behaved” peptides. All spread sheets with protein relative abundances were then exported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa). In IPA, only direct relationships were allowed in the general settings and genes. Endogenous chemical interactions and causal networks were both included. All items were selected under data sources, confidence, species and mutation.5. Conclusions In summary, this study is the first to identify spaceflight-induced proteomic significance and biomarkers in the gray and white matter of the murine brain. These unique “proteomic signatures” of brain tissue may provide new mechanistic insight into the complex biological response to space environment. We propose that spaceflight conditions induce changes in neuronal structure, cellular function, oxidative response, mitochondrial function and metabolism, which, in turn, might lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. The diverse changes in protein expression profiles in white and gray matter in response to spaceflight conditions warrants further investigation. Further studies are also necessary to elucidate the possible tissue and functional impact responsible for our findings and to identify effective countermeasures.Acknowledgments This study would not have been possible without the support of Amgen, Inc. and their team.

    "abstract": "Abstract Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon stimulated a shift into a new era of research, merging biology and aerospace in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent fluid flow within the cardiovascular system [1,2,3]. Changes in cardiac output, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and heart morphology have been reported following exposure to the spaceflight environment [4,5,6]. The low-dose radiation environment in space can also initiate structural damage at the DNA, cellular, and organ levels [2]. Ongoing studies using multi-omics suggest that the impact of spaceflight appears to vary depending on the model, the organ system, the differentiation status of the cells, and the length of spaceflight exposure [7,8]. Studies focused on the cardiovascular system have shown that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) cultured on the International Space Station (ISS) responded to the spaceflight environment by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function [9]. In the cardiac tissue of mice, transcriptional changes induced after 15 days in space include the differential expression of genes related to the cell cycle, senescence, and redox balance [10]. Cardiac remodeling and alterations in the expression of proteasome and extracellular matrix genes occurred in the hearts of Drosophila after 30 days in spaceflight [11]. Little is known, however, about transcriptomic changes in mammalian hearts in vivo following 30 days of spaceflight. A better understanding of transcriptomic changes within the intact heart in space is important for long-term missions planned for the future. In this study, we provide a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes in the mouse heart after 30 days on the ISS.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Flight and Control Conditions Female C57BL/6J mice aged 8–9 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL). Although there were several groups in this study, this report focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the heart when mice are housed in the spaceflight environment for 30 days. Mice were acclimatized for 1–2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Their living conditions were controlled for temperature and humidity and included a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. During this adaptation period, the mice were adapted to the flight hardware (Rodent Research Hardware System). Mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) and comparable ground control mice were maintained under identical conditions, including a single injection of saline. At 30 days, flight mice were transferred into the ISS Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG), were euthanized via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia followed by closed-cardiac puncture exsanguination and cervical dislocation. After removal of the spleen, mice were wrapped in foil, frozen and stored in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) at −96 °C until sample return. NASA GLACIER and Cold Bag lockers were used to transport samples back to the ground following mission completion. 2.2. Tissue Collection and RNA Extraction for Sequencing The frozen ground control and spaceflight mice were slightly thawed, dissected on ice, and the inferior two-thirds of the hearts were extracted. Cardiac tissue sections were stored in RNALater, RNAProtect, or were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNAProtect samples were stored at −20 °C. The RNALater and flash-frozen samples were stored at −80 °C. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three mice flown on the ISS and three hearts from comparable hardware- and age-matched ground control mice. The extraction of RNA from cardiac tissue was conducted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 25 mg of cardiac tissue was homogenized with QIAzol (Qiagen) and centrifuged. The aqueous layer was extracted, and then filtered using RNeasy Mini Spin columns provided in the kit. RNA was eluted using 30 µL of RNase-free water. RNA quality was assessed using nanodrop and gel electrophoresis, and RIN >8 was verified prior to sequencing. 2.3. RNA Sequencing and Analysis Poly(A) RNA sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, Texas) using RNA from three ground control mice and three spaceflight mice. The Poly(A) sequencing library was prepared using Illumina’s TrueSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer was utilized to validate RNA integrity. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip was used to conduct quality control analyses and quantification of the sequencing library. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 system. To conduct transcript assembly, Cutadapt [12] and perl scripts in house were used to remove reads with adaptor contamination, low-quality bases, and undetermined bases. Sequence quality was verified using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) version 0.10.1 (accessed on 01 September 2022). HISAT2 was utilized to map the genome of ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/ v101 (accessed on 01 September 2022), while StringTie was used for transcript assembly [13,14]. The comprehensive transcriptome was generated from merged transcriptomes via perl scripts and gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare/) (accessed on 01 September 2022). To conduct mRNA expression profiling, LC Sciences utilized StringTie and Ballgown (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ballgown.html) (accessed on 01 September 2022) [14]. StringTie specifically was used to calculate FPKM [14]. R package DESeq and edgeR were used to determine differentially expressed mRNAs [15,16]. A p-value of 0.05 and a fold change cutoff of 2 were chosen for this analysis. This subsequent data was analyzed u\\sing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis), (accessed 27 October 2022) [17]. RNA sequencing data was additionally uploaded to STRING and David Gene Ontology to determine significantly affected pathways and functions [18,19,20].",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Cardiac Transcriptome Alterations Induced by 30 Days in Spaceflight KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) scatterplots were generated based on the top one hundred significantly (p < 0.01) expressed genes and transcripts in the spaceflight group (Figure 1a–c). Genes that function within the cAMP, cGMP-PKG, and calcium signaling pathways contributing to cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival were identified as enriched (Figure 1b). Spaceflight significantly altered the expression of Adcy9, Atp2a1, Adrb3, Nppa, Myl9, Adcy9, Grin2c, Ptgfr, Atp2a1, and Adrb3 in the cGMP-PKG and calcium signaling pathways. In the cAMP signaling pathway, five of six genes were downregulated, including Grin2c, Drd2, Nppa, Ppp1r1b, and Myl9, while Adcy9 was upregulated. This effect might be explained by the downregulation of Nppa expression. Nppa is an upstream regulator of Adcy9. GO analyses indicated that spaceflight has an impact on several molecular functions and biological processes (Figure 1c). A total of 1147 significantly regulated transcripts included 514 transcripts that were classified as upregulated (45%) and 633 transcripts that were downregulated (55%) in spaceflight (Figure 1d). The upregulated transcripts play a role in calcium, protein kinase A, ERK-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, senescence, cell cycle, and cAMP-mediated signaling. DAVID GO identified the cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton in the top ten most prevalent KEGG pathways from the 633 downregulated transcripts.

Each canonical pathway is colored proportionally to the p-value of a right-tailed Fisher’s test. A more saturated red indicates greater significance.The top 100 most significant alterations in the transcriptome induced by spaceflight are shown in the heatmap (Figure 1e). The group of uniformly downregulated transcripts in the spaceflight group, namely transcripts Rps5 through Nedd4l, have enzymatic functions and roles in transcriptional regulation. Some were identified as ribosomal proteins. Similarly, in the group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, namely Ythdc1 through Ifi47, 11 transcripts contribute to cell survival and 10 transcripts have functional roles in cellular development, molecular transport, and protein trafficking. This upregulated transcript group is involved in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation, cellular assembly and organization, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, p53 signaling, and cell survival. Within this large group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, Ric8b, Synpo2, Pik3cd, and E2f3 were of particular interest because they regulate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cellular proliferation, the GPCR signaling pathway, and cell migration, respectively. From these top one hundred significant transcripts, a canonical pathway map was created to depict the most prevalent cellular signaling pathways. The cellular processes shown include the senescence pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling, p53 signaling, and E2F signaling (Figure 1f). The cellular processes most affected by stressful conditions in spaceflight are those that contribute to cellular maintenance and survival. 3.2. MAPK Signaling Is Activated by Spaceflight Signaling pathways that impact cytoskeletal arrangement, CREB signaling, stress, cardiac hypertrophy, senescence, and other pathways involve MAPK signaling. The MAPK signaling pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway or MAPKKK pathway) is a highly complex signaling cascade that involves six groups. Four subfamilies are the most well-known and include extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases (JNK1,−2,−3), p38 kinase, and MAPK (BMK/ERK5). This signaling pathway is activated through signal transduction from integrins and cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases and/or G-protein-coupled receptors. One of the top three canonical pathways generated in IPA with a positive z-score was the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 2a). ERK pathway activation involves the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK, also known as ERK1 and ERK2, ERK translocation to the nucleus, and the activation of several transcription factors. These transcription factors alter gene expression to promote growth, differentiation, and /or mitosis. As shown in Figure 2a, the upregulation of ERK1/2 and the inhibition of SOS and BAD are predicted to prevent apoptosis. Several transcripts induced by spaceflight and identified by IPA as significant (p-value 3.63 x 10-3) are shown in the heatmaps (Figure 2b,c). Figure 2. Open in a new tab MAPK Signaling Is Upregulated in Spaceflight. (a) ERK/MAPK pathways are upregulated in the heart during spaceflight. IPA was used to identify mRNA transcripts predicted to be impacted in hearts from flight and ground control mice; (b,c) Heatmap comparing MAPK-associated transcript expression in flight and ground controls; (d,e) MAPK-related transcripts were significantly induced while in spaceflight (p < 0.001) vs ground controls.Twenty-three transcripts related to the MAPK pathway were significantly induced. All twenty-three transcripts ranging from the lowest to highest level of expression are shown in Figure 2d,e. Seven transcripts were elevated within the range of 2 to ~50 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 2d). Five of these seven transcripts regulate angiogenesis, proliferation, and play a role in preventing apoptosis. The final two transcripts, Plce1 and Rasgrf2, are involved in GTPase activity and calcium-regulated nucleotide exchange and were induced by 22 to 48 fold over transcript levels expressed in ground control mice. As shown in Figure 2e, the remaining 16 transcripts were also upregulated significantly. These transcripts were induced by 700 to 26,000+ fold, (p < 0.001). The most highly expressed transcripts are involved in signal transduction, mediating cell responses to proinflammatory cytokines, environmental stresses, ion channel subunits, serine/threonine-protein kinases, and protein phosphatases. The genes encoding these transcripts include Ppp5c, Rps6ka4, Map2k7, and Cacna1c. 3.3. Spaceflight Modifies Actin but Has Limited Effect on the ECM in the Heart All significantly regulated transcripts were uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology (DAVID GO) for functional enrichment and annotation analyses. Transcripts associated with the cytoskeleton (p = 1.0 x 10-7, Benjamini = 1.5 x 10-5) were significantly altered when comparing the spaceflight and control groups. To determine which aspects of the cytoskeleton were most heavily affected, 159 significant cytoskeleton-related transcripts were selected for target analyses. In total, 86 transcripts (54%) were downregulated and 73 transcripts (46%) were upregulated, shown in green and red, respectively (Figure 3a). The most significant finding from the KEGG analyses of this subset was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (p = 8.8 x 10-15, Benjamini = 1.6 x 10-12). This information was used to generate a pathway demonstrating the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 3b). Actin stabilization, actin polymerization, actomyosin assembly, and focal adhesion were all associated with downregulated transcripts, indicating a potential inhibition of these functions. The upregulation of PAK activates MAPK. Despite the significant dysregulation of the cytoskeleton, the evaluation of prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) components revealed that only 2 of 50 transcripts were altered (Figure 3c). Specifically, one collagen transcript, col4a5, was downregulated and one integrin, Itgb1, was upregulated. This reveals a predominantly unaltered transcriptome of products associated with ECM. Thrombospondins, fibronectin, vitronectin, and dystroglycan were also not altered by spaceflight in this model. To address the potential functional impact of all ECM transcripts that were affected, 37 significantly modulated ECM products were uploaded to DAVID GO. This allowed us to generate an ECM–receptor interaction chart based on KEGG analyses (Figure 3d). Collagen dysregulation has the potential to affect integrins involved with VLA proteins and proteoglycans. FRAS1 and agrin are of interest in multiple contexts as both play roles in organ development; however, in the context of ECM receptor binding, the downregulation of these transcripts can impact integrins and glycoproteins. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight modifies actin but has limited effect on the ECM in the heart. (a) A total of 155 significantly modulated cytoskeleton-related transcripts were selected from the original transcript data received from LC Sciences. Of this subset, 86 were upregulated and 73 were downregulated. (b) This dataset was uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology for subset analyses. The most significant KEGG analysis demonstrated there was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in spaceflight with a downregulation of the products involved in focal adhesion, actin stabilization, actin polymerization, and actomyosin assembly (p = 8.8 x 10-15, Benjaminini = 1.6 x 10-12); (c) ECM components were analyzed for any changes induced by spaceflight, namely collagens, integrins, laminins, and elastin. Of these components, only two transcripts were significantly altered out of 50; (d) 37 significantly altered ECM-related transcripts were uploaded to DAVID GO for targeted analyses. KEGG analyses of ECM-binding products demonstrated limited interaction. FRAS1, collagen, and agrin were significantly downregulated and integrin beta 1 was significantly upregulated. Figures (b) and (d) were created using BioRender.com (accessed on 15 December 2022). 3.4. The PI3K-Akt Pathway Is Induced by Spaceflight The PI3K-Akt pathway is one of the top five canonical pathways impacted by spaceflight with a p-value of 6.21 × 10−3. DAVID GO identified 18 genes associated with this pathway (Benjamini 1.8 × 10−22), where Mdm2, Tsc1, Hras, and Pik3cd transcripts were significantly elevated in expression with a fold change ranging from 3–13,830 (p < 0.001) (Figure 4a,b). Hras is an upstream promoter of Pik3cd, a component of the PI3K complex, which leads to the activation of cell survival, cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, and protein synthesis (Figure 4c). G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling was revealed as a significant canonical pathway (p-value = 1.22 × 10−6). Transcripts associated with GPCR signaling were induced by spaceflight, including P2ry1, Hras, Rapgef3, Plce1, Pik3cd, Prkacb, Atf2, Pde4c, Creb5, Camk2b, Lpar1, and Adcy7. These transcripts were upregulated in space, ranging from 2–7631 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 4d,e). Multiple pathways downstream of GPCR signaling were activated or predicted to be activated by spaceflight (Figure 4f). These downstream pathways included YAP/TAZ, NFkB, AKT, IP3, DAG, MAPK, STAT3, CREB, RAS, and mTOR. The pathways predicted to be activated promote cell survival, proliferation, and enhance cellular response to oxidative stress (Figure 4f). Figure 4. Open in a new tab PI3K-Akt and G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling is Upregulated in Spaceflight. (a,b) Significantly elevated transcripts in the spaceflight group associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway include the following: Mdm2, 6480-fold change; Tsc1, 13,830-fold change; Hras, 3-fold change; and Pik3cd, 50-fold change. (c,f) IPA-generated canonical pathways of PI3K-Akt and GPCR signaling.

The Spaceflight Environment Activates Transcripts Associated with the Cell Cycle Transcriptomic analyses comparing cardiac tissue samples collected from the space mice and the control mice maintained on the ground revealed elevated transcripts associated with the activation of the cell cycle in space. A fold change cutoff of 2.0 was applied to differentially expressed transcripts, resulting in the identification of thirty-one statistically significant transcripts that were found to be elevated. The fold changes ranged from 3 to over 6000 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 5a,b). In murine embryonic stem cells, Cdk2ap2 is a regulator of cell renewal and is essential for survival during differentiation [21]. Pak4 plays a role in proliferation, cell migration, adhesion, and survival [22]. Phf8 regulates transcription factors necessary for cell-cycle progression and a lack of this transcript results in a prolonged G2 phase before mitosis [23]. The transcript with the highest fold change was Jade1, which activates transcription through the process of histone acetylation. Although the specific transcript encoding Jade1 has not been previously studied in the spaceflight environment, prior publications have reported that histone acetylation increases in microgravity [24,25]. A heatmap comparing the expression levels of transcripts associated with cell-cycle activation on the ground and in space is shown in Figure 5c. Figure 5d shows the network of interaction that ties the significantly elevated transcripts together. Hras and Mdm2 both activate and are activated by multiple transcripts. Hras activates cell progression and Mdm2 is known to induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [26,27]. The microgravitational environment enhances cell-cycle progression, coupled with cell survival in the cardiovascular system of mice. Figure 5.

(d) A protein–protein interaction network with data generated in String demonstrates connections between the transcripts identified in (a) and (b). 3.6. Transcripts Associated with Cellular Senescence Are Not Significantly Elevated in the Heart Microgravity does not promote cellular senescence in the heart of space mice after long-term exposure. Figure 6a shows a pathway for cellular senescence that was created through IPA, comparing mice maintained on the ground and mice housed in space. Differential transcript expression values were uploaded to the IPA database for all significant genes related to the cell cycle. Using that analysis, a pathway was created to predict cellular senescence where reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to oxidative stress, which causes DNA damage. According to IPA, ROS and oxidative stress molecules show low levels of predicted activation and DNA damage is not predicted. Ras activation, however, stimulates PI3k and MAPK. The downstream effect of this is the inactivation of senescence. Twenty-four transcripts related to senescence were analyzed (Figure 6b), of which only four were significantly altered by spaceflight, including Pak4, which was upregulated and functions to activate pro-survival pathways [22]. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cellular senescence is not predicted to be induced by spaceflight. (a) Pathway analysis was conducted using IPA, showing that cellular senescence is not likely to be induced in mouse hearts after 30 days in space; (b) 24 transcripts related to senescence were examined from transcriptomic data. Of these transcripts, only 4 variants were significant, with only 3 inducing senescence. Figure (a) was created using BioRender.com 2 December 2022. 3.7. Oxidative Stress in the Heart Most transcripts associated with oxidative stress were not significantly altered in the hearts of mice flown on the ISS for 30 days. As shown in Table 1, the fold change in the expression of 21 genes related to oxidative stress ranged from 0.22–1.62, with no significant difference in expression when comparing the ground control mice to the space mice (p > 0.05). A list of 126 transcripts associated with oxidative stress was created. The change in expression when comparing flight and ground conditions was only significant in seven of these genes (p ≤ 0.0005). The variants that were significant included 1600014C10Rik, Etfdh, Gpx1, and Ndufs2, which were upregulated, and Sirt1, Slc7a11, and Tor1a, which were downregulated. The expression of the remaining 119 genes in this group was unchanged as demonstrated in Figure 7. Table 1. Differential Gene Expression Changes in Oxidative Stress Markers after Spaceflight.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The increasing interest in space exploration and long-term spaceflight requires a better understanding of the reactive and adaptive changes that occur in various organ systems after exposure to the unique conditions of the space environment. Microgravity and radiation are known to induce alterations in gene expression; however, limited information has been reported defining the transcriptomic changes that impact organ system functions. This report provides a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes that occur in the mouse heart after 30 days of spaceflight aboard the ISS. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to use an in vivo model to focus on the effects of long-term (30 day) spaceflight on gene expression, molecular pathways, and cellular changes occurring in the heart. Several signaling pathways and cellular processes were altered in a manner suggestive of cellular adaptation through mechanisms that promote survival. The cytoskeleton adjusts to microgravity in a manner which follows the cellular tensegrity model [28], which purports the concept that gravitational change breaks the tension load on cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins, consequently triggering reorganization [29]. Our studies on the mouse heart demonstrate that cytoskeleton breakdown and reorganization occur. We identified 83 transcripts that were significantly downregulated and 76 transcripts that were significantly upregulated, including integrins beta-1 (transmembrane proteins attaching the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix). Cytoskeletal changes may also be influenced by trophic changes in cardiomyocytes, affecting tension and load bearing. These alterations impact MAPK signaling pathways. Further studies conducted during extended periods of spaceflight (e.g., 6 months) are needed to determine whether cytoskeletal reorganization reaches an optimal point for cellular functioning. Interestingly, our model showed limited changes to the major components of the extracellular matrix, although the ECM undergoes modifications in spaceflight in the mouse lung and drosophila heart [11,30]. The impact of spaceflight on the ECM may differ according to organ, species, or length of exposure. An open versus closed cardiac system may result in significantly different adaptive responses. Transcriptomic analyses reveal active cell proliferation linked to cell-cycle regulation. Known cell-cycle markers indicate that cells divide and survive in the heart. Recent studies show the enhanced proliferation of immune cells in mice undergoing microgravity exposure [31]. Infiltrating immune cells or endothelial cell activation may be contributing factors [32]. Enhanced proliferation could lead to cytoskeletal adaptations in spaceflight mice. Macrophages exhibit structural changes in their cytoskeletal arrangement, specifically impacting actin in response to microgravity [33]. MAPK signaling plays an essential role in cell-cycle activation, cell growth, differentiation, development, and survival [34,35]. MAPK signaling was predicted to be induced by spaceflight in the mouse heart. Prior studies using isolated cells flown on the ISS for 4–5 days reported an increased expression of small GTPases, Ras, and Rho, which coincides with our transcriptome results [36]. Ras/MAPK regulates stress signal responses and consequently elevates antioxidant transcripts [37]. Prxl2c transcripts were elevated in our findings, consistent with this interpretation. Peroxiredoxin-like 2C (Prxl2c) is predicted to enable antioxidant activity and functions in the positive regulation of ERK1/2 and in the regulation of glycolytic processes. MAPK has also been reported to be activated in the mouse brain by microgravity [38]. The cytoprotective role of MAPK is one of the many downstream effects of GPCR and PI3K pathway activation [34,39]. It is well understood that the activation of GPCR signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway leads to cellular survival, cell-cycle progression, and, more specifically, cardiomyocyte survival and cardiovascular homeostasis [40,41,42]. Previous studies in other models focusing on the role of PI3K in cardiac health have revealed the role of this pathway in eliciting protective changes following physiological stress [42,43,44,45,46]. The impact of spaceflight on this signaling pathway in a cardiac model in space, however, is not well understood. Cultured cells exposed to spaceflight conditions have shown an increase in G-protein alpha subunit activation and elevated MAPK signaling activity [36,47]. Under short-term simulated microgravity conditions, decreased PI3K and AKT expression and higher apoptotic rates were reported in cultured cells [48]. Detrimental physiological changes have been associated with the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [49]. Our study revealed a significant upregulation of multiple transcripts that comprise the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in cardiac tissue following 30 days in space. Our findings suggest that cellular survival and adaptation occur through the upregulation of the GPCR and PI3K-Akt pathways as a response to long-term exposure to the space environment. The activation of the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways may function in a protective capacity during spaceflight to counter the effects of the physiologically stressful environment. To our knowledge, little is known about the effect of the space environment on the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in the cardiovascular system in live animals subjected to long-term spaceflight. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular changes within the cardiovascular system that allow for adaptation to the space environment are necessary to prepare for future long-term space travel. Surprisingly, oxidative stress was not significantly induced in the heart at 30 days. Mitochondria are the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and microgravity has been shown to activate its production. The imbalance of ROS versus the processes that prevent oxidative stress can cause the mitochondria to become dysfunctional [50]. Most of the transcripts involved in the regulation of oxidative stress were not affected in our model; only 7 of 126 transcripts examined showed a significant change in expression. Five of these transcripts offered cell protection and only two were impacted in a manner that would be expected to promote ROS production. These transcripts were Ndufs2, which forms part of the core of NADH dehydrogenase complex I, and Etfdh, which is part of the electron transport chain. Both have the potential to affect ROS levels in the mitochondria [51]. However, it is notable that although these significant transcripts can increase ROS levels, they may not be sufficient independently. Because it is well accepted that microgravity can increase the concentration of reactive oxygen species [52], it is possible that the oxidant nature of ROS further activates Ras/MAPK cascades that respond to stress signals and create a balanced system through the increased transcription of antioxidants [37]. This could explain why a significant upregulation of Gpx1 was noted in our study. Gpx1 increases glutathione levels to aid in oxidative defense [53]. In addition to activating the antioxidative response, MAPK functions to induce cellular homeostasis in conjunction with processes such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is known to regulate and degrade proteins within the MAPK pathway [54]. The proteasome units, once activated, can begin degrading not only the MAPK transcripts, but also the oxidized proteins which are typically found in excess during oxidative stress [55]. Oxidative stress has been shown to increase due to microgravity [52]. The ability to manage oxidative stress may be influenced by the time of exposure or the organ system studied. Research on mice and mouse-derived cells in spaceflight has often focused on organs other than the heart. This includes the brain and skeletal system, although there was a recent publication that demonstrated select genes associated with oxidative stress in the heart were elevated in shorter-term spaceflight exposure [10,56,57]. Interestingly, the expression of these genes was not elevated at 30 days. We speculate that our experimental data could be due to acclimatization in the heart during the extended time mice were exposed to microgravity. Cellular senescence may occur as a consequence of exposure to the stress of the spaceflight environment. Senescence occurs when cells enter cell-cycle arrest [58]. Within the mouse heart, our findings demonstrate that cell-cycle progression was not impeded by spaceflight, oxidative stress was managed, and cellular senescence was not predicted to occur by transcriptomic analyses. Stress mechanisms activate senescence, yet our data show that transcriptomic changes associated with oxidative stress were not significantly induced after 30 days in space. This may, in part, explain why senescence was not predicted to be activated in the heart. It is also possible that the young age of the mice utilized in our study may have obscured senescence-related changes [59]. Spaceflight-related senescence may be better observed in older mice. Additionally, our study was limited to the use of female mice. In humans, female astronauts suffer different cardiac effects compared to their male counterparts [60]. Studies planned for the future should be designed to include animals of both sexes in order to determine whether sex-based disparities occur in responses to the spaceflight environment. Sequential timepoint analyses would also be beneficial in order to provide insight regarding the ways in which the length of exposure to the spaceflight environment influences adaptive and reactive changes in the heart. Based on our findings, we propose that 30 days in spaceflight provides enough time for the initiation of an adaptive response to the space environment to occur within the murine heart. Out of 86,406 analyzed transcripts, only 1147 transcripts (1.3%) were significant in the flight group, suggesting that by 30 days the heart has successfully adapted to the stressful space conditions. Some cellular processes that may contribute to adaptation and survival are the PI3K-Akt pathway, GPCR signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Transcriptomic analyses predicted the activation of these pathways in the flight group. The ability of the heart to adapt to the space environment after long-term spaceflight is one possible explanation for the lack of differences in ROS and oxidative stress when comparing the flight and ground control groups in our study. Additionally, over time, adaptation can shift the focus from survival to growth, away from senescence, and towards cell proliferation. Survival in space may be facilitated by the adaptive nature of the transcriptome.",

Copyright notice ID: 9953463 PMID: 36830740 Abstract Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight. Keywords: International Space Station, spaceflight, transcriptomics, cardiovascular system, RNA sequencing, adaptive response, signaling, oxidative stress1. Introduction The historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon stimulated a shift into a new era of research, merging biology and aerospace in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent fluid flow within the cardiovascular system [1,2,3]. Changes in cardiac output, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and heart morphology have been reported following exposure to the spaceflight environment [4,5,6]. The low-dose radiation environment in space can also initiate structural damage at the DNA, cellular, and organ levels [2]. Ongoing studies using multi-omics suggest that the impact of spaceflight appears to vary depending on the model, the organ system, the differentiation status of the cells, and the length of spaceflight exposure [7,8]. Studies focused on the cardiovascular system have shown that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) cultured on the International Space Station (ISS) responded to the spaceflight environment by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function [9]. In the cardiac tissue of mice, transcriptional changes induced after 15 days in space include the differential expression of genes related to the cell cycle, senescence, and redox balance [10]. Cardiac remodeling and alterations in the expression of proteasome and extracellular matrix genes occurred in the hearts of Drosophila after 30 days in spaceflight [11]. Little is known, however, about transcriptomic changes in mammalian hearts in vivo following 30 days of spaceflight. A better understanding of transcriptomic changes within the intact heart in space is important for long-term missions planned for the future. In this study, we provide a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes in the mouse heart after 30 days on the ISS.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Flight and Control Conditions Female C57BL/6J mice aged 8–9 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL). Although there were several groups in this study, this report focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the heart when mice are housed in the spaceflight environment for 30 days. Mice were acclimatized for 1–2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Their living conditions were controlled for temperature and humidity and included a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. During this adaptation period, the mice were adapted to the flight hardware (Rodent Research Hardware System). Mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) and comparable ground control mice were maintained under identical conditions, including a single injection of saline. At 30 days, flight mice were transferred into the ISS Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG), were euthanized via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia followed by closed-cardiac puncture exsanguination and cervical dislocation. After removal of the spleen, mice were wrapped in foil, frozen and stored in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) at −96 °C until sample return. NASA GLACIER and Cold Bag lockers were used to transport samples back to the ground following mission completion.2.2. Tissue Collection and RNA Extraction for Sequencing The frozen ground control and spaceflight mice were slightly thawed, dissected on ice, and the inferior two-thirds of the hearts were extracted. Cardiac tissue sections were stored in RNALater, RNAProtect, or were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNAProtect samples were stored at −20 °C. The RNALater and flash-frozen samples were stored at −80 °C. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three mice flown on the ISS and three hearts from comparable hardware- and age-matched ground control mice. The extraction of RNA from cardiac tissue was conducted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 25 mg of cardiac tissue was homogenized with QIAzol (Qiagen) and centrifuged. The aqueous layer was extracted, and then filtered using RNeasy Mini Spin columns provided in the kit. RNA was eluted using 30 µL of RNase-free water. RNA quality was assessed using nanodrop and gel electrophoresis, and RIN >8 was verified prior to sequencing.2.3. RNA Sequencing and Analysis Poly(A) RNA sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, Texas) using RNA from three ground control mice and three spaceflight mice. The Poly(A) sequencing library was prepared using Illumina’s TrueSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer was utilized to validate RNA integrity. An Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip was used to conduct quality control analyses and quantification of the sequencing library. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 system. To conduct transcript assembly, Cutadapt [12] and perl scripts in house were used to remove reads with adaptor contamination, low-quality bases, and undetermined bases. Sequence quality was verified using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) version 0.10.1 (accessed on 01 September 2022). HISAT2 was utilized to map the genome of ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-101/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/ v101 (accessed on 01 September 2022), while StringTie was used for transcript assembly [13,14]. The comprehensive transcriptome was generated from merged transcriptomes via perl scripts and gffcompare (https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare/) (accessed on 01 September 2022). To conduct mRNA expression profiling, LC Sciences utilized StringTie and Ballgown (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ballgown.html) (accessed on 01 September 2022) [14]. StringTie specifically was used to calculate FPKM [14]. R package DESeq and edgeR were used to determine differentially expressed mRNAs [15,16]. A p-value of 0.05 and a fold change cutoff of 2 were chosen for this analysis. This subsequent data was analyzed u\\sing Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis), (accessed 27 October 2022) [17]. RNA sequencing data was additionally uploaded to STRING and David Gene Ontology to determine significantly affected pathways and functions [18,19,20].3. Results 3.1. Cardiac Transcriptome Alterations Induced by 30 Days in Spaceflight KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) scatterplots were generated based on the top one hundred significantly (p < 0.01) expressed genes and transcripts in the spaceflight group (Figure 1a–c). Genes that function within the cAMP, cGMP-PKG, and calcium signaling pathways contributing to cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival were identified as enriched (Figure 1b). Spaceflight significantly altered the expression of Adcy9, Atp2a1, Adrb3, Nppa, Myl9, Adcy9, Grin2c, Ptgfr, Atp2a1, and Adrb3 in the cGMP-PKG and calcium signaling pathways. In the cAMP signaling pathway, five of six genes were downregulated, including Grin2c, Drd2, Nppa, Ppp1r1b, and Myl9, while Adcy9 was upregulated. This effect might be explained by the downregulation of Nppa expression. Nppa is an upstream regulator of Adcy9. GO analyses indicated that spaceflight has an impact on several molecular functions and biological processes (Figure 1c). A total of 1147 significantly regulated transcripts included 514 transcripts that were classified as upregulated (45%) and 633 transcripts that were downregulated (55%) in spaceflight (Figure 1d). The upregulated transcripts play a role in calcium, protein kinase A, ERK-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, senescence, cell cycle, and cAMP-mediated signaling. DAVID GO identified the cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton in the top ten most prevalent KEGG pathways from the 633 downregulated transcripts. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Transcripts Affected by Spaceflight. (a) Experimental timeline of spaceflight mice; (b) KEGG-pathway-enrichment scatterplot; (c) Gene ontology (GO)-enrichment scatterplot; (d) Volcano plot of transcript expression in the spaceflight group; (e) Heatmap of transcript expression levels showing the top 100 transcripts (p < 0.05) in spaceflight (F11, F12, F13) and control groups (G25, G2, G3); (f) IPA-generated pathway map relating to the top 100 significant transcripts. Each canonical pathway is colored proportionally to the p-value of a right-tailed Fisher’s test. A more saturated red indicates greater significance.The top 100 most significant alterations in the transcriptome induced by spaceflight are shown in the heatmap (Figure 1e). The group of uniformly downregulated transcripts in the spaceflight group, namely transcripts Rps5 through Nedd4l, have enzymatic functions and roles in transcriptional regulation. Some were identified as ribosomal proteins. Similarly, in the group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, namely Ythdc1 through Ifi47, 11 transcripts contribute to cell survival and 10 transcripts have functional roles in cellular development, molecular transport, and protein trafficking. This upregulated transcript group is involved in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation, cellular assembly and organization, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, p53 signaling, and cell survival. Within this large group of uniformly upregulated transcripts, Ric8b, Synpo2, Pik3cd, and E2f3 were of particular interest because they regulate the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cellular proliferation, the GPCR signaling pathway, and cell migration, respectively. From these top one hundred significant transcripts, a canonical pathway map was created to depict the most prevalent cellular signaling pathways. The cellular processes shown include the senescence pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling, p53 signaling, and E2F signaling (Figure 1f). The cellular processes most affected by stressful conditions in spaceflight are those that contribute to cellular maintenance and survival.3.2. MAPK Signaling Is Activated by Spaceflight Signaling pathways that impact cytoskeletal arrangement, CREB signaling, stress, cardiac hypertrophy, senescence, and other pathways involve MAPK signaling. The MAPK signaling pathway (also known as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway or MAPKKK pathway) is a highly complex signaling cascade that involves six groups. Four subfamilies are the most well-known and include extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2 terminal kinases (JNK1,−2,−3), p38 kinase, and MAPK (BMK/ERK5). This signaling pathway is activated through signal transduction from integrins and cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases and/or G-protein-coupled receptors. One of the top three canonical pathways generated in IPA with a positive z-score was the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 2a). ERK pathway activation involves the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK, also known as ERK1 and ERK2, ERK translocation to the nucleus, and the activation of several transcription factors. These transcription factors alter gene expression to promote growth, differentiation, and /or mitosis. As shown in Figure 2a, the upregulation of ERK1/2 and the inhibition of SOS and BAD are predicted to prevent apoptosis. Several transcripts induced by spaceflight and identified by IPA as significant (p-value 3.63 x 10-3) are shown in the heatmaps (Figure 2b,c). Figure 2. Open in a new tab MAPK Signaling Is Upregulated in Spaceflight. (a) ERK/MAPK pathways are upregulated in the heart during spaceflight. IPA was used to identify mRNA transcripts predicted to be impacted in hearts from flight and ground control mice; (b,c) Heatmap comparing MAPK-associated transcript expression in flight and ground controls; (d,e) MAPK-related transcripts were significantly induced while in spaceflight (p < 0.001) vs ground controls.Twenty-three transcripts related to the MAPK pathway were significantly induced. All twenty-three transcripts ranging from the lowest to highest level of expression are shown in Figure 2d,e. Seven transcripts were elevated within the range of 2 to ~50 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 2d). Five of these seven transcripts regulate angiogenesis, proliferation, and play a role in preventing apoptosis. The final two transcripts, Plce1 and Rasgrf2, are involved in GTPase activity and calcium-regulated nucleotide exchange and were induced by 22 to 48 fold over transcript levels expressed in ground control mice. As shown in Figure 2e, the remaining 16 transcripts were also upregulated significantly. These transcripts were induced by 700 to 26,000+ fold, (p < 0.001). The most highly expressed transcripts are involved in signal transduction, mediating cell responses to proinflammatory cytokines, environmental stresses, ion channel subunits, serine/threonine-protein kinases, and protein phosphatases. The genes encoding these transcripts include Ppp5c, Rps6ka4, Map2k7, and Cacna1c.3.3. Spaceflight Modifies Actin but Has Limited Effect on the ECM in the Heart All significantly regulated transcripts were uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology (DAVID GO) for functional enrichment and annotation analyses. Transcripts associated with the cytoskeleton (p = 1.0 x 10-7, Benjamini = 1.5 x 10-5) were significantly altered when comparing the spaceflight and control groups. To determine which aspects of the cytoskeleton were most heavily affected, 159 significant cytoskeleton-related transcripts were selected for target analyses. In total, 86 transcripts (54%) were downregulated and 73 transcripts (46%) were upregulated, shown in green and red, respectively (Figure 3a). The most significant finding from the KEGG analyses of this subset was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (p = 8.8 x 10-15, Benjamini = 1.6 x 10-12). This information was used to generate a pathway demonstrating the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 3b). Actin stabilization, actin polymerization, actomyosin assembly, and focal adhesion were all associated with downregulated transcripts, indicating a potential inhibition of these functions. The upregulation of PAK activates MAPK. Despite the significant dysregulation of the cytoskeleton, the evaluation of prominent extracellular matrix (ECM) components revealed that only 2 of 50 transcripts were altered (Figure 3c). Specifically, one collagen transcript, col4a5, was downregulated and one integrin, Itgb1, was upregulated. This reveals a predominantly unaltered transcriptome of products associated with ECM. Thrombospondins, fibronectin, vitronectin, and dystroglycan were also not altered by spaceflight in this model. To address the potential functional impact of all ECM transcripts that were affected, 37 significantly modulated ECM products were uploaded to DAVID GO. This allowed us to generate an ECM–receptor interaction chart based on KEGG analyses (Figure 3d). Collagen dysregulation has the potential to affect integrins involved with VLA proteins and proteoglycans. FRAS1 and agrin are of interest in multiple contexts as both play roles in organ development; however, in the context of ECM receptor binding, the downregulation of these transcripts can impact integrins and glycoproteins. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight modifies actin but has limited effect on the ECM in the heart. (a) A total of 155 significantly modulated cytoskeleton-related transcripts were selected from the original transcript data received from LC Sciences. Of this subset, 86 were upregulated and 73 were downregulated. (b) This dataset was uploaded to DAVID Gene Ontology for subset analyses. The most significant KEGG analysis demonstrated there was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in spaceflight with a downregulation of the products involved in focal adhesion, actin stabilization, actin polymerization, and actomyosin assembly (p = 8.8 x 10-15, Benjaminini = 1.6 x 10-12); (c) ECM components were analyzed for any changes induced by spaceflight, namely collagens, integrins, laminins, and elastin. Of these components, only two transcripts were significantly altered out of 50; (d) 37 significantly altered ECM-related transcripts were uploaded to DAVID GO for targeted analyses. KEGG analyses of ECM-binding products demonstrated limited interaction. FRAS1, collagen, and agrin were significantly downregulated and integrin beta 1 was significantly upregulated. Figures (b) and (d) were created using BioRender.com (accessed on 15 December 2022).3.4. The PI3K-Akt Pathway Is Induced by Spaceflight The PI3K-Akt pathway is one of the top five canonical pathways impacted by spaceflight with a p-value of 6.21 × 10−3. DAVID GO identified 18 genes associated with this pathway (Benjamini 1.8 × 10−22), where Mdm2, Tsc1, Hras, and Pik3cd transcripts were significantly elevated in expression with a fold change ranging from 3–13,830 (p < 0.001) (Figure 4a,b). Hras is an upstream promoter of Pik3cd, a component of the PI3K complex, which leads to the activation of cell survival, cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, and protein synthesis (Figure 4c). G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling was revealed as a significant canonical pathway (p-value = 1.22 × 10−6). Transcripts associated with GPCR signaling were induced by spaceflight, including P2ry1, Hras, Rapgef3, Plce1, Pik3cd, Prkacb, Atf2, Pde4c, Creb5, Camk2b, Lpar1, and Adcy7. These transcripts were upregulated in space, ranging from 2–7631 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 4d,e). Multiple pathways downstream of GPCR signaling were activated or predicted to be activated by spaceflight (Figure 4f). These downstream pathways included YAP/TAZ, NFkB, AKT, IP3, DAG, MAPK, STAT3, CREB, RAS, and mTOR. The pathways predicted to be activated promote cell survival, proliferation, and enhance cellular response to oxidative stress (Figure 4f). Figure 4. Open in a new tab PI3K-Akt and G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling is Upregulated in Spaceflight. (a,b) Significantly elevated transcripts in the spaceflight group associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway include the following: Mdm2, 6480-fold change; Tsc1, 13,830-fold change; Hras, 3-fold change; and Pik3cd, 50-fold change. (c,f) IPA-generated canonical pathways of PI3K-Akt and GPCR signaling. (d,e) Significantly upregulated transcripts in the spaceflight group associated with the GPCR pathway include the following: P2ry1, 2-fold change; Hras, 3-fold change; Rapgef3, 6-fold change; Plce1, 21-fold change; Pik3cd, 50-fold change; Prkacb, 1317-fold change; Atf2, 1405-fold change; Pde4c, 1861-fold change; Creb5, 2182-fold change; Camk2b, 2344-fold change; Lpar1, 3145-fold change; and Adcy7, 7631-fold change. ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001.3.5. The Spaceflight Environment Activates Transcripts Associated with the Cell Cycle Transcriptomic analyses comparing cardiac tissue samples collected from the space mice and the control mice maintained on the ground revealed elevated transcripts associated with the activation of the cell cycle in space. A fold change cutoff of 2.0 was applied to differentially expressed transcripts, resulting in the identification of thirty-one statistically significant transcripts that were found to be elevated. The fold changes ranged from 3 to over 6000 fold (p < 0.001) (Figure 5a,b). In murine embryonic stem cells, Cdk2ap2 is a regulator of cell renewal and is essential for survival during differentiation [21]. Pak4 plays a role in proliferation, cell migration, adhesion, and survival [22]. Phf8 regulates transcription factors necessary for cell-cycle progression and a lack of this transcript results in a prolonged G2 phase before mitosis [23]. The transcript with the highest fold change was Jade1, which activates transcription through the process of histone acetylation. Although the specific transcript encoding Jade1 has not been previously studied in the spaceflight environment, prior publications have reported that histone acetylation increases in microgravity [24,25]. A heatmap comparing the expression levels of transcripts associated with cell-cycle activation on the ground and in space is shown in Figure 5c. Figure 5d shows the network of interaction that ties the significantly elevated transcripts together. Hras and Mdm2 both activate and are activated by multiple transcripts. Hras activates cell progression and Mdm2 is known to induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [26,27]. The microgravitational environment enhances cell-cycle progression, coupled with cell survival in the cardiovascular system of mice. Figure 5.

(d) A protein–protein interaction network with data generated in String demonstrates connections between the transcripts identified in (a) and (b).3.6. Transcripts Associated with Cellular Senescence Are Not Significantly Elevated in the Heart Microgravity does not promote cellular senescence in the heart of space mice after long-term exposure. Figure 6a shows a pathway for cellular senescence that was created through IPA, comparing mice maintained on the ground and mice housed in space. Differential transcript expression values were uploaded to the IPA database for all significant genes related to the cell cycle. Using that analysis, a pathway was created to predict cellular senescence where reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to oxidative stress, which causes DNA damage. According to IPA, ROS and oxidative stress molecules show low levels of predicted activation and DNA damage is not predicted. Ras activation, however, stimulates PI3k and MAPK. The downstream effect of this is the inactivation of senescence. Twenty-four transcripts related to senescence were analyzed (Figure 6b), of which only four were significantly altered by spaceflight, including Pak4, which was upregulated and functions to activate pro-survival pathways [22]. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cellular senescence is not predicted to be induced by spaceflight. (a) Pathway analysis was conducted using IPA, showing that cellular senescence is not likely to be induced in mouse hearts after 30 days in space; (b) 24 transcripts related to senescence were examined from transcriptomic data. Of these transcripts, only 4 variants were significant, with only 3 inducing senescence. Figure (a) was created using BioRender.com 2 December 2022.3.7. Oxidative Stress in the Heart Most transcripts associated with oxidative stress were not significantly altered in the hearts of mice flown on the ISS for 30 days. As shown in Table 1, the fold change in the expression of 21 genes related to oxidative stress ranged from 0.22–1.62, with no significant difference in expression when comparing the ground control mice to the space mice (p > 0.05). A list of 126 transcripts associated with oxidative stress was created. The change in expression when comparing flight and ground conditions was only significant in seven of these genes (p ≤ 0.0005). The variants that were significant included 1600014C10Rik, Etfdh, Gpx1, and Ndufs2, which were upregulated, and Sirt1, Slc7a11, and Tor1a, which were downregulated. The expression of the remaining 119 genes in this group was unchanged as demonstrated in Figure 7. Table 1. Differential Gene Expression Changes in Oxidative Stress Markers after Spaceflight.

These genes show no significant regulation in stress response after 30 days of spaceflight, as defined by a p-value greater than 0.05.Figure 7. Open in a new tab Prolonged spaceflight has a limited effect on oxidative stress in the heart. All genes associated with the oxidative stress pathway were uploaded for subset analyses in David Gene Ontogeny. Ninety four percent of transcripts that affect oxidative stress were not significantly changed by spaceflight after 30 days. Six percent of the total number of transcripts analyzed were significantly impacted by spaceflight (p ≤ 0.0005).4. Discussion The increasing interest in space exploration and long-term spaceflight requires a better understanding of the reactive and adaptive changes that occur in various organ systems after exposure to the unique conditions of the space environment. Microgravity and radiation are known to induce alterations in gene expression; however, limited information has been reported defining the transcriptomic changes that impact organ system functions. This report provides a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression changes that occur in the mouse heart after 30 days of spaceflight aboard the ISS. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to use an in vivo model to focus on the effects of long-term (30 day) spaceflight on gene expression, molecular pathways, and cellular changes occurring in the heart. Several signaling pathways and cellular processes were altered in a manner suggestive of cellular adaptation through mechanisms that promote survival. The cytoskeleton adjusts to microgravity in a manner which follows the cellular tensegrity model [28], which purports the concept that gravitational change breaks the tension load on cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins, consequently triggering reorganization [29]. Our studies on the mouse heart demonstrate that cytoskeleton breakdown and reorganization occur. We identified 83 transcripts that were significantly downregulated and 76 transcripts that were significantly upregulated, including integrins beta-1 (transmembrane proteins attaching the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix). Cytoskeletal changes may also be influenced by trophic changes in cardiomyocytes, affecting tension and load bearing. These alterations impact MAPK signaling pathways. Further studies conducted during extended periods of spaceflight (e.g., 6 months) are needed to determine whether cytoskeletal reorganization reaches an optimal point for cellular functioning. Interestingly, our model showed limited changes to the major components of the extracellular matrix, although the ECM undergoes modifications in spaceflight in the mouse lung and drosophila heart [11,30]. The impact of spaceflight on the ECM may differ according to organ, species, or length of exposure. An open versus closed cardiac system may result in significantly different adaptive responses. Transcriptomic analyses reveal active cell proliferation linked to cell-cycle regulation. Known cell-cycle markers indicate that cells divide and survive in the heart. Recent studies show the enhanced proliferation of immune cells in mice undergoing microgravity exposure [31]. Infiltrating immune cells or endothelial cell activation may be contributing factors [32]. Enhanced proliferation could lead to cytoskeletal adaptations in spaceflight mice. Macrophages exhibit structural changes in their cytoskeletal arrangement, specifically impacting actin in response to microgravity [33]. MAPK signaling plays an essential role in cell-cycle activation, cell growth, differentiation, development, and survival [34,35]. MAPK signaling was predicted to be induced by spaceflight in the mouse heart. Prior studies using isolated cells flown on the ISS for 4–5 days reported an increased expression of small GTPases, Ras, and Rho, which coincides with our transcriptome results [36]. Ras/MAPK regulates stress signal responses and consequently elevates antioxidant transcripts [37]. Prxl2c transcripts were elevated in our findings, consistent with this interpretation. Peroxiredoxin-like 2C (Prxl2c) is predicted to enable antioxidant activity and functions in the positive regulation of ERK1/2 and in the regulation of glycolytic processes. MAPK has also been reported to be activated in the mouse brain by microgravity [38]. The cytoprotective role of MAPK is one of the many downstream effects of GPCR and PI3K pathway activation [34,39]. It is well understood that the activation of GPCR signaling and the PI3K-AKT pathway leads to cellular survival, cell-cycle progression, and, more specifically, cardiomyocyte survival and cardiovascular homeostasis [40,41,42]. Previous studies in other models focusing on the role of PI3K in cardiac health have revealed the role of this pathway in eliciting protective changes following physiological stress [42,43,44,45,46]. The impact of spaceflight on this signaling pathway in a cardiac model in space, however, is not well understood. Cultured cells exposed to spaceflight conditions have shown an increase in G-protein alpha subunit activation and elevated MAPK signaling activity [36,47]. Under short-term simulated microgravity conditions, decreased PI3K and AKT expression and higher apoptotic rates were reported in cultured cells [48]. Detrimental physiological changes have been associated with the downregulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway [49]. Our study revealed a significant upregulation of multiple transcripts that comprise the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in cardiac tissue following 30 days in space. Our findings suggest that cellular survival and adaptation occur through the upregulation of the GPCR and PI3K-Akt pathways as a response to long-term exposure to the space environment. The activation of the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways may function in a protective capacity during spaceflight to counter the effects of the physiologically stressful environment. To our knowledge, little is known about the effect of the space environment on the GPCR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in the cardiovascular system in live animals subjected to long-term spaceflight. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular changes within the cardiovascular system that allow for adaptation to the space environment are necessary to prepare for future long-term space travel. Surprisingly, oxidative stress was not significantly induced in the heart at 30 days. Mitochondria are the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and microgravity has been shown to activate its production. The imbalance of ROS versus the processes that prevent oxidative stress can cause the mitochondria to become dysfunctional [50]. Most of the transcripts involved in the regulation of oxidative stress were not affected in our model; only 7 of 126 transcripts examined showed a significant change in expression. Five of these transcripts offered cell protection and only two were impacted in a manner that would be expected to promote ROS production. These transcripts were Ndufs2, which forms part of the core of NADH dehydrogenase complex I, and Etfdh, which is part of the electron transport chain. Both have the potential to affect ROS levels in the mitochondria [51]. However, it is notable that although these significant transcripts can increase ROS levels, they may not be sufficient independently. Because it is well accepted that microgravity can increase the concentration of reactive oxygen species [52], it is possible that the oxidant nature of ROS further activates Ras/MAPK cascades that respond to stress signals and create a balanced system through the increased transcription of antioxidants [37]. This could explain why a significant upregulation of Gpx1 was noted in our study. Gpx1 increases glutathione levels to aid in oxidative defense [53]. In addition to activating the antioxidative response, MAPK functions to induce cellular homeostasis in conjunction with processes such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is known to regulate and degrade proteins within the MAPK pathway [54]. The proteasome units, once activated, can begin degrading not only the MAPK transcripts, but also the oxidized proteins which are typically found in excess during oxidative stress [55]. Oxidative stress has been shown to increase due to microgravity [52]. The ability to manage oxidative stress may be influenced by the time of exposure or the organ system studied. Research on mice and mouse-derived cells in spaceflight has often focused on organs other than the heart. This includes the brain and skeletal system, although there was a recent publication that demonstrated select genes associated with oxidative stress in the heart were elevated in shorter-term spaceflight exposure [10,56,57]. Interestingly, the expression of these genes was not elevated at 30 days. We speculate that our experimental data could be due to acclimatization in the heart during the extended time mice were exposed to microgravity. Cellular senescence may occur as a consequence of exposure to the stress of the spaceflight environment. Senescence occurs when cells enter cell-cycle arrest [58]. Within the mouse heart, our findings demonstrate that cell-cycle progression was not impeded by spaceflight, oxidative stress was managed, and cellular senescence was not predicted to occur by transcriptomic analyses. Stress mechanisms activate senescence, yet our data show that transcriptomic changes associated with oxidative stress were not significantly induced after 30 days in space. This may, in part, explain why senescence was not predicted to be activated in the heart. It is also possible that the young age of the mice utilized in our study may have obscured senescence-related changes [59]. Spaceflight-related senescence may be better observed in older mice. Additionally, our study was limited to the use of female mice. In humans, female astronauts suffer different cardiac effects compared to their male counterparts [60]. Studies planned for the future should be designed to include animals of both sexes in order to determine whether sex-based disparities occur in responses to the spaceflight environment. Sequential timepoint analyses would also be beneficial in order to provide insight regarding the ways in which the length of exposure to the spaceflight environment influences adaptive and reactive changes in the heart. Based on our findings, we propose that 30 days in spaceflight provides enough time for the initiation of an adaptive response to the space environment to occur within the murine heart. Out of 86,406 analyzed transcripts, only 1147 transcripts (1.3%) were significant in the flight group, suggesting that by 30 days the heart has successfully adapted to the stressful space conditions. Some cellular processes that may contribute to adaptation and survival are the PI3K-Akt pathway, GPCR signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Transcriptomic analyses predicted the activation of these pathways in the flight group. The ability of the heart to adapt to the space environment after long-term spaceflight is one possible explanation for the lack of differences in ROS and oxidative stress when comparing the flight and ground control groups in our study. Additionally, over time, adaptation can shift the focus from survival to growth, away from senescence, and towards cell proliferation. Survival in space may be facilitated by the adaptive nature of the transcriptome.Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.K.-J. and M.J.P.; methodology, M.K.-J. and M.J.P.; validation, M.K.-J., L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H. and R.V.; formal analysis, L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H. and R.V.; investigation, L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H., A.M., and R.V.; resources, M.K.-J. and M.J.P.; data curation, L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H. and R.V.; writing—original draft preparation, L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H. and R.V.; writing—review and editing, M.K.-J.,. visualization, L.M., L.H., A.L.V., B.H., J.B. and R.V.; supervision, M.K.-J.; project administration, M.K.-J.; funding acquisition, M.K.-J. and M.J.P.
