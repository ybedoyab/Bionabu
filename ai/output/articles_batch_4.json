    "abstract": "Abstract Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage. Subject terms: Systems analysis, Predictive markers, Cardiology",
    "introduction": "Introduction The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity fields, and prolonged isolation in a hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of spaceflight crews. The biological consequences of spaceflight also present a unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially3–5. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non-autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can be used as biomarkers6,7, and are associated with human diseases8–10. We have extensively characterized a circulating miRNA signature associated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3D human-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure11–14. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space-flown animal models11 and revealed a conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovascular system and was widely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvessel collapse13 and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15 caused by space radiation exposure. Multi-omic analyses of biomedical profiles of astronauts along with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to spaceflight-associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mitochondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellular metabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscular and neurological disorders16. Here, a 3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularly focusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved with cardiovascular damage. We find that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we confirm the specific targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study17, a JAXA mission18, and the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as countermeasures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate spaceflight damage and reduce human health risks in human spaceflight missions.",
    "methods": "Methods Ethical statement All mice experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory’s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs and according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Inspiration4 (I4) mission was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after informed consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All crewmembers consented to data and sample sharing. The NASA Twin Study subjects signed informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki and 14 CFR Part 1230 for collection and use of sample materials and data in research protocols at NASA and the collaborating institutions. Study protocols were approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Review Board (protocol number Pro1245) and all participating institutions. Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values. Cell culture Prior to culturing 3D microvessels, HUVEC (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA), primary cells isolated from the vein of the umbilical cord were cultured as 2D monolayers in complete endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ, USA), containing EGM medium (serum free) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine brain extract. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) and the medium was changed twice a week. All cells used for experiments were cells thawed from a fresh vial. 3D HUVEC vessel cell model In this study, 3D cell culture was performed according to the method initially described by Davis et al.88 with modifications described in Grabham et al.21. Briefly, a collagen gel solution (Rat tail Collagen Type 1, BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) was prepared on ice by mixing together the following stock solutions: 0.35% collagen solution, 10 Å~ M199 medium, and 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) in a ratio of 8:1:1 by (volume). This solution was then mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a ratio of 3:1 by (volume). HUVECs grown in EGM on 2D cell culture dishes (80–90% confluence) were detached with a trypsin solution (0.025%) and resuspended in EGM-2 (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA). The cell solution was mixed with the gel solution in a ratio 1:5 (by volume). The resulting cell suspension contained a final cell suspension of 1×106 cells/ml. 25 μl was dropped onto the cell growing surface inside a tissue culture flask (T25) (Corning) and allowed to gel at 37 °C for 30 min. The gel matrices were then overlaid with EGM-2 medium for 7 days with daily media changes. EBM-2 consists of EGM-2 media supplemented with 2% FBS, human fibroblast growth factor B (hFGF-B), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), human vascular endothelial cell growth factor (hVEGF), long R insulin-like growth factor 1 (R3-IGF-1), ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone and heparin. 50 nM Phorbol 12- Myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Millipore Sigma) was also added to the growth media. Cells embedded in 200–300-μm thick gel matrices were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) for the times indicated. The medium was refreshed every 24 h or as otherwise stated in individual experiments. For mature microvessels, cells were cultured for 6 days and treated with AUMantagomirTM (AUM biotech) (0.5 µM each) 24 h before radiation exposure then fixed 24 h later. For the angiogenesis model, cultures were irradiated on day one and cultured for 6 more days before fixation. Preliminary experiments showed that antagomir treatment on days 2 and 3 were most effective. For DNA damage/repair (i.e. 53BP1 staining), cultures were fixed at 90 min after irradiations. Simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure Irradiation of microvessel models and animals were conducted at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Samples were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature. Dosimetry was performed by the NSRL physics staff. For microvessel models, cultures were seeded at Columbia University in New York City then transported to BNL the same day. Irradiations were carried out the following day (Day 1) at NSRL. A 20 cm × 20 cm beam was utilized. Since the heavy-ion beam at NSRL is horizontal, flasks containing 5 ml of medium were upended to a vertical position for a few minutes during irradiation. All cultures were irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated GCR (referred to as GCR). The irradiation was used with ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula for 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n,4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV, in the following proportions – 1000 MeV protons at 34.8%, 250 MeV protons at 39.3%, 28Si at 1.1%, 4He at 18%, 16O at 5.8%, and 56Fe at 1%. This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions48. The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of charged particles although high LET ions generally have a greater relative biological effect (RBE). Quantification of 3D human cell culture models after irradiation: Immunocytochemistry, Imaging, and microvessel analysis All microvessel cultures were fixed and stained as for monolayers. Fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by three washes in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% Triton-X, and finally in PBS. 5-(4,6-Dichlorotriazinyl) Aminofluorescein (DTAF) (Thermofisher Scientific) was used to as a fluorescent green stain for all proteins to visualize microvessels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 53BP1 foci were immunostained using a polyclonal antibody against 53BP1 (Catalog #: NB100-304, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and a counterstain for nuclei with YOYO green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by Alexa fluor conjugates 495 or 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were captured on a Nikon TE 200 confocal C1 microscope with EZ-C1 software. Analysis of images was carried out using  Image J v. 1.44k software68. Initial analysis on microvessels was carried out on randomly selected 20X fields from within the gel matrix. Thresholded images of microvessels were outlined as perimeters then divided by 2 for length measurements. For the improved analysis the field size was increased 4-fold by using images captured by a 10× objective. The mature microvessels were defined more rigorously as those of a minimum diameter of 12.5 μm. This step eliminated many immature thin vessels and reduced the effective doses. Finally, the sample fields were standardized, by imaging microvessels at a constant depth (50 mm above the substrate). All analyses were carried out blind. DNA double strand break repair foci assay was carried out by counting the number of foci per nucleus. MicroRNA predictions of DNA DSB gene targets and network generation We predicted specific DNA DSB genes that are targeted by three miRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p. The DNA DSB gene list was determined by filtering out all DNA DSB related Gene Ontology (GO) pathways46,89. Each GO DNA DSB pathway will have curated genes associated with the pathway. We compiled all genes related to these into a master list and deleted any duplicated genes. We then utilized the ClueGO+CluePedia plugin90,91 in Cytoscape92 to map the relationship between the gene targets for the three miRNAs. This was done by including all DNA DSB genes and the three miRNAs in the initial query list. The edges and connections were made with CluePedia utilizing the following miRNA-mRNA databases in the plugin: CluePedia STRING-Actions (v.11.0_9606_27.02.2019), CluePedia microRNA.org-human predictions_s_O_aug2020, miRDB_v6.0, miRanda-miRNAs v5-2012-07-19, mirTarBase, and mirecords.umn.edu.validated.miRNAs-2010-11-25. Nucleic acid extraction for 3D human cell culture models We used n = 5 biological replicates for each condition for RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gel matrix cryotubes containing the cells of interest were taken out of −80 °C and 1 mL of QIAzol reagent was added to the tubes. Each sample contained 300–800 µL of gel matrix and approximately 500,000 cells. While the gel matrix thawed in QIAzol, the solution was pipetted and vortexed until fully dissolved. The lysate was passed through a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to further homogenize the cells. 100 µL of gDNA eliminator solution was added. The resulting lysate from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30–50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration of all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter93. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Spike in Protocols before library preparation in 3D cultures ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing93. Library construction for RNA-sequencing on 3D cultures RNA ribo-depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 6.5 (average RIN of 8.7). Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 PCR cycles were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit93. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Bulk RNA-sequencing and data processing on 3D cultures RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp(8 bp index +9 bp UMI), Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX was included as an internal control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers93. Raw fastq files were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. pyrpipe was used for quantification of the orphan genes and other EB genes23,69. Using DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed separately for the 3 conditions on each 3D microvessel cell culture model. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the log2(Fold-Change) values and the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (v3.15.0). We have utilized for our analysis a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance and acknowledge the potential of more false positives to occur. All TPM values can be found in Supplemental Data 1. Raw RNA-seq data is available on the NASA OSDR’s Biological Data Management Environment94 with accession number: OSD-577. Determination of the 21 key gene targets for the three miRNAs, cumulative plots for the miRNA targets, and statistical test To determine the 21 key gene targets for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, we found the genes that were statistically significantly downregulated for 0.5 Gy vs 0 Gy and no longer significant for 0.5 Gy with antagomir vs 0 Gy. We then utilized mirDIP95 to determine the gene targets for all 3 miRNAs with a criteria of medium score class. The medium score class has been shown in the literature to provide a reasonable criteria for determining gene targets for miRNAs35. We overlapped these two lists of genes and found 21 genes. The 21 gene fold-change values, statistics, and TPM values can be found in Supplemental Data 2. We used the “Target Mining” function of the online platform miRwalk96. It allowed searching the 21 gene targets against the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16), and investigate their 3’-, 5’-UTR and coding sequence (CDS) regions with a binding probability cutoff of at least 0.75 (Sankey plot part of Fig. 5b–d). To this, we have added the genes’ respective log2 fold change given a GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). To build the cumulative plots for the 21 miRNA gene targets, we obtained the information about whether these genes have 7mer or 8mer sites that match the seed region of each the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16) using the TargetScan v8.0 database97. mRNAs were then grouped according to miRNA seed sequences (7mer-1A, 7mer-m8 or 8mer or ‘no site’), and the cumulative plot was generated using the mRNA log2 fold change values using the ecdfplot method from seaborn98. To compare distributions of mRNA fold change values for each seed match with the ‘no site’ case, we calculated the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test using the kstest function from scipy in python99. To determine the experimental validation for the 21 gene targets to the miRNAs, we utilized three databases which are: miRTarBase v9.037, TarBase v9.038, and StarBase v2.039. Both TarBase and miRTarBase include literature references for the experimental validation. We also provided additional literature references for some genes as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. We displayed these results both in Supplementary Table 1 and as bar plots (Fig. 5j) using ggplot2 (ver 3.3.5). Conserved miRNA analysis between humans and mice Selected precursor and mature miRNA sequences from human and mouse were extracted from miRBase v.22.1100. After BLASTN alignment, conservation between mouse and human sequences was determined as the percentage of aligned nucleotide identities in mature and pre-miRNA sequences. RTPCR on key gene targets Total RNA samples were prepared from the same RNA isolated for the bulk RNA-seq as described above and were DNase I treated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the BioRad iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix. To quantify gene expression of genes using TaqMan probes BioRad iTaq™ Universal Probes Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. To quantify gene expression of genes using DNA probes BioRad iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S were used as an internal reference. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on an BioRad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Instrument. Delta-delta-cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) was determined relative to ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S levels and normalized to control samples. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean from at least three biological replicates. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) For pathway analysis, we utilized fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA)101. Pathway analysis was done utilizing both MSigDB gene sets46 (specifically, Hallmark and KEGG) and custom-made Gene Set files from MitoPathway and expert-curated mitochondrial genes available in89. Using fGSEA, all samples were compared to controls and the ranked list of genes was defined by the t-score statistics. The statistical significance was determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets89. We utilized a statistical cutoff of FDR < 0.05 as recommended by GSEA and lollipop plots were made using ggplot2 (ver 3.3.5). All GSEA data generated for this manuscript can be found in Supplemental Data 3. Murine simulated space environment experiments The murine data utilized here were from experiments previously reported by Malkani et al.13 and Paul et al.14. All experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory’s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and all experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Briefly, n = 80 15-week +/−3-day old, C57Bl/6J wildtype female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12 h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. The normally loaded (NL) mice were originally utilized in parallel experiments with hindlimb unloaded mice which were not reported in this manuscript. Mice were cage acclimated (n = 10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded. Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-h post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for −80 °C storage. A 100 μl aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1× RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as described below. All organs were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at −80 °C. Body weight tracking was performed on days −3, 0, 7 and 14. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. A 60 × 60 beam was utilized at the NSRL for irradiation. Sham controls were treated similarly to GCR irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simulation, i.e. 25 min. miRNA extraction from murine tissues MiRNA extractions from plasma and all tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (Cat# 217184). MiRNA extractions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat# 217004). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouse experiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (#217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number >7. Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was used to prepare a small RNA library according to the protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor’s recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASA OSDR’s Biological Data Management Environment with the following identifiers: for all heart tissue related data: OSD-334, DOI: 10.26030/cg2g-as49; for all liver tissue related data: OSD-335, DOI: 10.26030/72ke-1k67: for all soleus muscle related data: OSD-337, DOI: 10.26030/m73g-2477; and for all plasma related data: OSD-336, DOI: 10.26030/qasa-rr29. Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to remove adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18~26 nucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase 22.0100 by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3’ and 5’ ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p-derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two were defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the flank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: (1) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem (≤12); (2) number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin (≥16); (3) cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol ≤−15); (4) length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop ≥50); (5) length of hairpin loop (≤20); (6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region (≤8); (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤4); (8) number of biased bulges in mature region (≤2); (9) number of errors in mature region (≤7); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12); and (11) percent of mature in stem (≥80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisher exact test, Chi-squared 2 × 2 test, Chi-squared nXn test, Student’s t test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The significance threshold was set to be 0.01 and 0.05 in each test. To determine gene ontology (GO)102 and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs, we performed miRNA gene set analysis utilizing the RbiomirGS23 v0.2.12 R package from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. The RbiomirGS package has been extensively shown in the literature to provide strong pathway prediction that provide strong biological results103–106. From the pathways we chose an FDR < 0.25 cutoff for significantly regulated pathways. We plotted the specific pathways with R package ggplot2. Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) of miRNAs-seq murine data Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the OSDR-334, OSDR-335, OSDR-336, and OSDR-337 miRNA-Seq datasets. First, the miRNA-Seq datasets were merged and outlier samples and genes were removed based on manual inspection using hierarchical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the built-in WGCNA goodSamplesGenes() function. Then Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) was performed using the R Bioconductor package, DESeq2 version 1.38.3. The R Bioconductor package, WGCNA version 1.72-1 was used to perform WGCNA following the standard protocol as detailed in the package vignette. NASA Twin Study data RNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briefly, we will highlight the key methods. The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into 4 mL CPT (Cell Preparation Tube with Sodium HeparinN) tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4 °C until processing (average of 35–37 h after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80 oC. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: 1. plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long term storage at −80 oC. 2. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight samples, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80 oC until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (Qiagen Cat# 1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80 oC until use. Details of transcriptome preparation, sequencing, and analysis were described previously17. NASA Twin Study data miRNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study miRNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briefly, we will highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB #E7560) per manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modifications: adapters and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEB# E7600, NEB#E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB #E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1x50bp). Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace107. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences108 using the miRDeep2109 quantifier module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p-value < 0.2 was independently performed for each cell type. For flight only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twin Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature components of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family. Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in Overbey et al.19, and Kim et al.110. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. There were two male and two female astronauts for this mission. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. In summary, blood samples were collected before (prelaunch; L-92 days, 44 days, and 3 days) and after (return; R + 1 day, R + 45 days, and R + 82 days) the spaceflight. 21 miRNA target genes suggested in the paper has been used for identifying DEGs from i4 PBMCs and subpopulations. The Seurat method was used to normalize RNA count data and calculate average expression of each gene. We used the average expression of the genes from four astronauts comparing post-flight (R + 1) vs pre-flight (L-92, L-44, and L-3) to identify DEGs with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.05). Average expression of the 21 miRNA target genes was used to generate heatmap plotted by the pheatmap R package. Figure 6f was created with BioRender.com. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). These biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. A 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differential expression analysis. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53018. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were made for the 21 genes key genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.

    "results": "Results Combined antagomir inhibition is effective in counteracting space radiation damage We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p in a 3D human microvasculature model. Firstly, we examined the effect of individual miRNAs to mitigate structural damage caused by space radiation exposure from simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The morphology of mature microvessels representing post-mitotic cells with characteristics of the endothelial barrier (tight junctions) was preserved by inhibiting any of the three key miRNAs (Fig. 1a, c). A single dose of each individual antagomir 24 h before GCR irradiation was sufficient to protect microvessels although the combination of the three was more effective. Furthermore, the inhibition by each miRNA was comparable to the unirradiated controls. Fig. 1. Antagomir treatment of 3D human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) microvessel cell cultures. Open in a new tab a, b Quantification of formation of microvessels using 3D cultures of human microvessels irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated galactic cosmic rays (GCR) compared to sham irradiated samples. Irradiated cultures were treated with or without antagomir-induced inhibition of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and/or let-7a-5p. For the boxplots the center line represents the median and the lines extending from both ends of the box indicates the quartile (Q) variability outside Q1 and Q3 to the minimum and maximum values. a mature and b angiogenesis microvessels. The p-values were determined by two-side multiple pairwise comparison. c Mature and angiogenesis microvessels fixed and fluorescently stained with 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF) after GCR irradiation, with or without antagomirs 24 h prior to irradiation. Scale bar = 100 µm. For mature the following biological independent samples were used: n = 17 for 0 Gy, n = 18 for 0.5 Gy, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 16 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir. For angiogenesis the following biological independent samples were performed: n = 18 for 0 Gy, n = 20 for 0.5 Gy, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 11 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 10 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir.A similar result was found for the longer multistage development of microvessels undergoing angiogenesis. In this model, cells were exposed to GCR on culture day 1, when they were still individual and not connected; while the irradiation effects were seen on day 6, when the endothelial cells should have been formed into mature microvessels (Fig. 1b, c). Individual antagomirs applied on days 2 and 3 restore angiogenesis at levels comparable to controls, and combined antagomirs exert an improved protective role (Fig. 1b). In both models, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p are similarly effective at counteracting the effects of space radiation, but the antagomir combination inhibition of the three miRNAs provides a stronger and more robust response. Hereafter, we focus on the biological changes occurring when inhibiting all three miRNAs. Combined antagomir inhibition protects microvessels from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by space radiation While the biological consequences of GCR exposure on mature and developing microvessels are clearly observed 24 h and 7 days after irradiation, respectively, examination of earlier endpoints would enable us to understand the impact of antagomir treatment. Since DNA is the primary target damaged by radiation, early effects from miRNA inhibition on DNA damage and repair were investigated. As the repair of DNA DSB damage by space radiation is pivotal for cellular function, we assessed the cellular proteins involved in DNA DSB repair targeted by miRNA inhibition. Many of the DNA DSB repair genes are common targets of the miRNAs as shown by a network representation for the perturbation effects of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5p (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in activating the DNA DSB repair pathways induced by GCR irradiation. Fig. 2. Quantification of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair foci with antagomir treatment and miRNA pathway analysis. Open in a new tab a Network representation for the DNA DSB repair gene targets for miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5p generated by ClueGO in Cytoscape.

Mice were euthanized (N = 10 irradiated and N = 10 sham controls) and tissues were harvested 24 h after irradiation. In Fig. 2 the schematics in panels b and d created with BioRender.com released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.To determine the molecular mechanism through which the antagomirs protect mature and developing microvessels from the effects of GCR, we studied the accumulation of DNA DSBs and the activation of DNA repair pathways. Immunocytochemical staining for the tumor suppressor p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) was quantified following antagomir treatment 90 min after GCR irradiation (Fig. 2b). The 53BP1 protein accumulates at the site DNA DSBs after irradiation, and the resulting repair foci can be measured as a critical platform for DNA DSB repair activity20. The peak DNA repair foci often occurs around 30 min after gamma irradiation and our previous publications showed that foci induced by charged particles decline over several hours in the human microvasculature model21. Our current analysis shows a significant increase in DNA DSB repair foci (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the antagomir treatment significantly decreased the number of foci to levels similar to the unirradiated condition. This demonstrates that the antagomirs protect microvasculature cells from DNA DSBs caused by space radiation at much earlier times due to potentially providing a more efficient DNA repair mechanism. The changes in expression of miRNAs after GCR exposure and its relationship to DNA repair mechanisms is not widely understood22. To determine if DNA DSBs are associated with a global response from those evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that we observed in vivo, we exposed C57BL/6 female mice to 0.5 Gy of GCR and performed miRNA-sequencing on the plasma, liver, soleus muscle, and heart (Fig. 2c, d). From pathway analysis23 of DNA DSB and repair pathways, we observed a comprehensive increase in DNA DSB genesets across all four tissues from the measured changes in miRNA expression. The global increase associated with overall miRNA activity following GCR irradiation further supports the key roles of these miRNAs in the DNA DSB repair pathways. Space radiation reveals key regulation of the three miRNAs in specific tissues To further establish miRNA changes after space radiation and the importance of miR-16, miR-125b, and let-7a with cardiovascular health risks, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the miRNA-seq data from the mice exposed to 0.5 Gy of GCR (Fig. 3)24. WGCNA classically was designed for transcriptomic RNA-seq data, but recently has proven its utility in miRNA-seq data25,26. Hence, we utilized WGCNA to determine key miRNA networks that are impacted by space radiation and how they are affected in the heart, liver, soleus muscle, and plasma of mice. The WGCNA analysis revealed three distinct miRNA networks (i.e., “Modules” or “ME”) that are most strongly impacted by GCR radiation, depending on the tissue type (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 3a–c). Interestingly, for all three Modules the heart tissue showed the most significant decrease comparing GCR irradiated mice to sham (Fig. 3a–c). For Module 0 (Figs. 3a) and 2 (Fig. 3c), the liver shows a significant increase. When observing the key miRNAs involved in each module we see that let-7a-5p is present in Module 0 (Fig. 3d), miR-16-5p in Module 1 (Fig. 3e), and miR-15b-5p in Module 2 (Fig. 3f). The individual miRNAs within each Module were differential expressed due to GCR radiation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 3.

Rescue of space radiation damage with inhibition of key miRNAs associated with cardiovascular space radiation damage Based on our intriguing results showing complete protection of the 3D human microvessel cell cultures post GCR irradiation by the inhibition of three miRNAs, we further investigated the key biological processes involved. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the mature microvessel and angiogenesis models after 0.5 Gy of GCR exposure and compared conditions with or without the combination of antagomirs (Fig. 4). The experimental design for the antagomir treatment is depicted in Fig. 4a. The antagomir treatment and endpoints after irradiation differ between the two models as described in Malkani et al.13 for the mature microvessel model and Wuu et al.15 for the angiogenesis model. Fig. 4. Global transcriptomic analysis reveals that antagomirs revert gene profiles closer to control samples.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. The adj. p-value plots are also provided in Supplementary Fig. 3.Global transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq results revealed key patterns associated to antagomir treatment after GCR irradiation. Overall, antagomir treated samples post-irradiation clustered closer to the sham unirradiated samples for both microvessel cell cultures (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the antagomir treatment had a substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels. Of note, we are utilizing p-value statistics for our main analysis and acknowledge that this may result in the potential of more false positives, but we believe that the information generated by lowering the statistical significance will produce more meaningful data and previous literature also provided further justification when necessary to utilize p-values27,28. In addition, we have also provided the adj. p-value analysis for full transparency of our results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the global clustering of both models demonstrates a restoration closer to the basal levels, there are measurable differences between the two models with GCR irradiation alone and GCR with the antagomirs. This is apparent when observing the transcriptomic patterns for the significantly regulated genes (Fig. 4c). GCR irradiation caused a greater number of genes to be differentially regulated for the mature vessel compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 4d, e). Antagomir treatment during irradiation in mature (before) or in angiogenesis cells (after) caused significant dysregulation in both models (Fig. 4d, e). Substantially more genes were uniquely altered in the angiogenesis compared to the mature microvessel model (Fig. 4f), as may be expected since the endpoint is much longer than in the mature microvessel model and encompasses multiple stages of development. We also identified a set of orphan genes to be differentially regulated in GCR-stressed samples and reversed by antagomir treatment. Orphan genes code for proteins that are unique to a species29–31 and may provide a major source of evolutionary novelty conferring beneficial traits to a species. Evidence-based (EB) orphan genes were identified by Singh32 based on a comprehensive analysis of 27,000 RNA-Seq datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project. To determine how human orphan genes respond to space radiation and antagomir treatment, differential expression of orphan genes was assessed in the RNA-seq data. In both models, tens of orphan genes were differentially expressed by space irradiation plus antagomirs, but not with radiation alone (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 4). Since orphan genes often integrate themselves into metabolic and regulatory networks31,33,34, these could play a role in the dysregulation of DNA repair and metabolic pathways associated with response to space radiation and antagomir treatment observed here. To better identify dysregulated genes targeted by the antagomirs, we used miRNA target analysis by the mirDIP algorithm35 to assess transcripts downregulated by irradiation but restored after antagomir treatment. Twenty-one gene targets, including PDPR, APAF1, XPO6, NIBAN1, and SLC7A1, were predicted to be simultaneous targets of each miRNA (Fig. 5a). To validate the key genes, we performed PCR on 8 of the 21 genes from the same isolated RNA utilized for the RNA-seq (Fig. 5b). We see that all the genes are in agreement with the RNA-seq data except for MSH5, which we see an upregulation with 0.5 Gy and then the expression returns back to 0 Gy levels after antagomir treatment. We investigated how well the miRNAs bound to the 21 gene targets (“antagomir-rescued genes”), and the log2 fold change from the RNA-seq data after GCR exposure. We observed that the three miRNAs bound to the 3’-UTR and CDS regions of 15 (Fig. 5c) and 13 (Fig. 5d) out of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes, respectively, whereas let-7a-5p and miR-125b-5p bound only to two of the target genes (Fig. 5e).

The experimental evidence for the targets have been compiled from TarBase, miRTarBase, starBase, and literature. We have also provided the details for the experimental evidence from these databases in Supplementary Table 1. The *mirDIP gene targets for each miRNA as shown in panel a. It is important to note that the databases provide literature references for all the experimental evidence and the literature indication in the figure is for additional literature evidence outside of these databases. j Radar plot illustrating homology of pre-miRNAs (red) and mature miRNAs (black) in humans and mice for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p.To survey the efficacy of the three miRNAs to downregulate the 21 gene targets, we analyzed RNA-seq fold change values from different experimental conditions using cumulative plots36 see Methods). Figure 5f shows that the 21 antagomir-rescued genes with 7-8mer 3’-UTR sites had a significant propensity to be downregulated compared to those without 3’-UTR sites (P = 4.99e−07, 2.65e−32 and 6.31e−09 for 8mer, 7mer-m8 and 7mer-A1, respectively, using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). These results indicate that miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p play a key role in the downregulation of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes. Figure 5g, h shows that the downregulation of these genes is drastically reduced under antagomir treatment, indicating that by inhibiting these 3 miRNAs, expression of these genes reverts towards the control (0 Gy) levels. Pathway analysis of the antagomir-restored transcripts targeted by one or more of the three miRNA shows an enrichment pattern for expression of genes associated with apoptosis and TP53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, alteration of these pathways may account for the observed preservation of the 3D microvessels by antagomir treatment with GCR exposure. To confirm that these 21 genes are actual targets for the three miRNAs we dissected the pathways involved with the mirDIP algorithm analysis and also provided experimental evidence from current databases and literature. While mirDIP draws from a comprehensive pool of 24 databases to evaluate miRNA targets35, our focus was on the analysis of the six most reputable databases among them (Fig. 5i). Additionally, we corroborated the experimental validation of these gene targets by cross-referencing data from three databases (i.e. miRTarBase37, TarBase38, and starBase39) alongside pertinent literature references (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Table 1). Our results indicate robust experimental validation of gene targets for the three miRNAs as follows: 10 out of 10 for miR-16-5p, 13 out of 14 for let-7a-5p, and 9 out of 15 for miR-125b-5p. It’s worth noting that while the validation rate for miR-125b-5p stands at 60% based on these databases, certain contextual conditions may influence the validation of gene targets for miRNAs. Nevertheless, our additional experimental evidence (Fig. 5b–h) enhances the confidence in our findings. Finally, it is crucial to assess the conservation of these three miRNAs between humans and mice. It is well-established that miRNAs exhibit high levels of conservation across species, particularly between mice and humans40. Our analysis demonstrates 100% conservation of all three mature miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, miR-125p-5p, and let-7a-5p) and their precursor forms have conservation rates greater than 95% between mouse and human genomes (Fig. 5j). Given the robust conservation observed, comparisons between results obtained in mouse and human contexts can be easily facilitated. Regulation of antagomir-rescued genes in astronauts The relevance to humans of the 21 genes that are rescued by the antagomir countermeasures in the 3D human tissues (Fig. 6a) were further examined using data from the NASA Twin Study17 (REF) (Fig. 6a–d), Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study18 of astronauts that were in space for 120 days (Fig. 6e, f), as well as data from the first civilian commercial 3-day spaceflight mission, referred to as Inspiration4 (I4)19 (Fig. 6g–s). The NASA Twin Study has been described in several papers which compared two identical twins with one Twin on the ISS for 340 days and the other twin on Earth12,17. The JAXA study conducted RNA-seq on plasma cell-free RNAs from six astronauts who were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days, sampled from pre-flight, during flight, and post-flight time points. The I4 mission performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on the blood and also RNA-seq skin biopsies which involved 4 astronauts (two males and two females) that orbited at low Earth orbit (LEO) at 590 km above the atmosphere (Fig. 6f). The I4 mission occurred at a much higher altitude than the ISS, thus the I4 astronauts experienced a higher accumulated dose of radiation compared to being on the ISS. It is important to note that the estimated accumulated doses of space radiation that the astronauts were exposed to for these missions were lower than 0.5 Gy (which is the estimated dose for a trip to Mars and back), but despite this we still observed key changes as we will describe below. The following are the accumulated doses that were measured for each mission: NASA Twin Study astronaut received 146.34 mSv or 14.634 cGy17, I4 astronauts received 4.72 mSv or 0.472 cGy19, and for the JAXA astronauts we estimated that they had received an accumulated dose of 51.60 mSv or 5.16 cGy (the dosimetry was not reported for this mission and this is an estimate based on the average dose received per month from other missions)18.

The three pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values.

There are individual gene variations observed from preflight to the last time point after return (i.e. R + 200 days), but the overall gene signature changes will indicate how these genes will be impacted by the three miRNAs. The global changes for these 21 genes over time is best observed with cumulative plots for the different cell types for the Twin in space over time (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Fig. 7a). It was observed that the only cell type to show significant changes for the 21 genes from flight to return on Earth were the lymphocyte depleted cells or monocytes (Fig. 7a). We show that for flight vs pre-flight and R + 1 vs pre-flight (i.e. immediately after return to Earth) there was significant downregulation for these key genes and then at 34 days and beyond, the genes have returned back to the control pre-flight expression. Fig. 7. The interaction of the three miRNAs with the 21 gene targets from the NASA Twin Study in Monocytes. Open in a new tab a Cumulative plots for change over time with the 21 genes targeted by the three miRNAs using RNA-seq data from the NASA Twin Study data. Sequencing was performed on lymphocyte depleted cells (i.e. monocytes) from the Twin that was onboard the ISS for 340 days. There are comparisons over time starting with Flight versus Pre-Flight as well as comparing the different Return (R) to Earth timepoints from 1 to 200 days versus Pre-Flight. b Correlation plot of the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-125b-5p) and the 21 gene targets for the overlapping time points from the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq NASA Twin Study data. The gene targets for the miRNAs are indicated in the outer black (yes for gene target) and gray (no for gene target) rows and columns. Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value and significance for the correlation is shown by *p-value < 0.05.To establish the direct relationship between the 21 gene targets and the three miRNAs, we utilized the NASA Twin Study which had both miRNA- and mRNA-seq data associated with the mission and cell types. Similar to the cumulative plots, we observed the correlation between the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16, let-7a, and miR-125b) with the 21 gene targets in the four different cell types (i.e. CD4, CD8, CD19, and monocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We correlated with the overlapping time points per each sample type and observed for the majority of the miRNAs and genes targets an inverse relationship. Specifically, for monocytes for the specific gene targets the miRNAs had an inverse correlation (Fig. 7b). Since the miRNAs will traditionally silence the specific gene target, this result is what we would expect and provides further validation in astronauts that these miRNAs in circulation will be ideal targets to reduce health risks as our in vitro results show. We noticed that most of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes in the JAXA data were downregulated during the flight, indicating that increased activity of the let-7a-5p, mir-125b-5p, and mir-16-5p might cause the suppression of these target genes in astronauts (Fig. 6e). Most of the genes show up-regulation post-flight as compared to pre-flight and during flight (Fig. 6e). This is consistent with the i4 data, in which antagomir-rescued gene activity is significantly increased post-flight compared to the pre-flight in most of the cell types sampled from the astronauts (Fig. 6c). The ratio of up-regulation in these selected 21 antagomir-rescued genes is more significant than the average up-regulation ratio of all genes (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that this subset is more susceptible to expression change due to the space environment. Cell-dependent differences are detectable for specific genes during spaceflight for the I4 astronauts data (Fig. 6e–n and Supplementary Fig. 6). Two genes, ARL6IP6 (ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase 6 Interacting Protein 6) and TSEN15 (TRNA Splicing Endonuclease Subunit 15), are significantly up-regulated post-flight compared to pre-flight in eight of the ten cell types, with CD16+ cells and dendritic cells (DCs) not significantly different for ARL6IP6 and CD14+ cells, and DCs not significantly different for TSEN15. ARL6IP6 is involved in ischemic strokes in patients41, which could have implications related to microvessel damage in space. In murine stem cells, ARL6IP6 exhibits properties of regulating nuclear envelope structure, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear envelope resealing and repair42. TSEN15 is involved in tRNA splicing and intron removal fundamental processes for cell growth and division43. It has been implicated in hypoplasia (the impairment in development of tissues and organs due to the decrease in cell number)44. Specifically, TSEN15 has been shown to cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and progressive microcephaly. Although this occurs at an early stage of life (i.e. infants), one could speculate that TSEN15 may play important roles in cell proliferation in adults. Interestingly, TSEN15 has also been associated with autoinflammatory neurodegenerative diseases45. ARL6IP6 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6) is predicted to be targeted by miR-125b-5p and let-7a-5p and TSEN15 is predicted to be targeted by miR-16-5p and let-7a-5 (Fig. 5). Skin biopsies from the i4 astronauts were also used for RNA-seq comparing post-flight to pre-flight (Fig. 6s) with four different skin regions in the analysis: Outer Epidermis (OE), Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA). The VA compartment is closely related to the 3D microvessel cell models which seems to produce the strongest regulation of the 21 key genes. ARL6IP6 is upregulated in the VA for post-flight compared to pre-flight similar to what is observed in the blood (Fig. 6i–r), while TSEN15 is downregulated. Interestingly, 57%, 52%, and 52% of the 21 genes were downregulated for the OE, IE, and VA regions, while for the OD region only 38% were downregulated. Overall, for all the astronaut data, the measured changes of these genes from ex vivo cellular samples may suggest that an interventional treatment with the three antagomirs might lead to improved astronaut health. Major cellular pathways altered by radiation exposure and rescued by antagomir treatment To determine the key pathways that are altered by radiation with or without antagomir treatment, we performed pathway analysis on the bulk RNA-seq data via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Using the Hallmark database46, general pathway enrichments were more pronounced in the mature microvessels compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 8a, b). Radiation exposure in both these models triggered positive enrichment of pathways typically observed from this treatment such as TP53, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-alpha signaling. For both the mature microvessel and angiogenesis cellular models, there was a significantly decreased enrichment associated with the mitotic spindle due to radiation exposure that was reversed by the antagomir treatment. This is consistent with the fact that cellular death following radiation exposure may occur through mitotic catastrophe due to failure of mitotic spindle checkpoints47. Fig. 8. Pathway analysis on the mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models revealing key functions being mitigated by the antagomirs after exposure to GCR irradiation.

Gene sets that were significantly enriched in the same direction for the two treatment groups (both up or both down) are not shown leaving only opposing or single pathway enrichments. Only significantly regulated pathways with FDR < 0.05 are shown. The nominal enrichment score (NES) represents the relative degree a gene set is changed and is corrected for gene set size.An increase in inflammatory-related genes and pathways after irradiation is a common occurrence driving the late effects of radiation injury48,49. Radiation exposure with antagomir treatment caused a significant reversal in enrichment for several of these pathways. Strikingly, in both mature and angiogenesis microvessels, pathways for an inflammatory response, TNF-alpha signaling, interferon responses, and IL-6 are significantly decreased by the addition of antagomirs (Fig. 8a, b). Pathways for hypoxia, DNA repair, and oxidative phosphorylation are also activated with the GCR treatment while the antagomir treatment inhibits these pathways. The antagomirs also restored the suppression associated with cell cycle observed with space radiation for the angiogenesis model (Fig. 7b). As a result, the antagomirs appear to be regulating key pathways in the radiation response that may be essential in assisting repair of the damage caused by space radiation in the mature microvasculature. To further explore the consequences of antagomir treatment to radiation exposure, Reactome genesets consisting of 26 super pathways were examined (Fig. 8c, d). Positively or negatively enriched genesets in the same direction by irradiation with or without antagomirs were excluded. The remaining genesets have opposing enrichments or are enriched by only one treatment. These pathways may represent critical targets that provide beneficial effects from antagomir treatment. Genes involved in DNA repair by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) are enriched in mature microvessels after radiation exposure (Fig. 8c). However, adding antagomirs suppresses these changes as well as changes in genes linked to DNA damage bypass via translation synthesis. This was accompanied by a decrease in pathways involved in cellular stress [e.g. genesets for heme oxygenase 1, hypoxia, detoxification of ROS, EIF2AK4 (GCN2) amino acid deficiencies] as well as a decrease in cell cycle control including telomere maintenance. Notably, there was an overall increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization with the irradiation and antagomirs that was not statistically significant with radiation alone. Earlier during the angiogenesis phase of the microvessels, irradiation overwhelmingly decreased cell cycle genesets while the addition of the antagomirs abolished this statistically significant manifestation (Fig. 8d). DNA replication as well as DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination was also returned to non-significant control levels by antagomir treatment. DNA damage, inflammation, stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are normally associated with the induction of cellular senescence48. Therefore, we used publicly available databases compiling markers of cellular senescence50,51 to investigate whether GCR caused senescence and the antagomirs protected the 3D human microvasculature model from it. Curiously, most senescence pathways were suppressed by GCR, except for oncogene-induced senescence (Supplementary Fig. 8). This is consistent with upregulation of TP53 target genes, although it dissociates oncogene induction from other causes of senescence induction. The antagomirs did not revert these phenotypes, except in the angiogenesis model, where they promoted cellular senescence in GCR-exposed cells. Antagomir treatment after space radiation modulates critical cellular pathways To specifically observe how key immune and inflammatory pathways are regulated with and without the antagomir treatment in the space environment, we analyzed a custom curation of genesets for innate and adaptive immune pathways (Fig. 9). There was an overall increased activity with GCR radiation exposure for the mature microvessel culture. However, when the antagomirs were applied, general inflammatory and immune pathways were restored back to the 0 Gy level for the mature microvessel model with a negative regulation in the angiogenesis cell model indicating that this countermeasure treatment diminished this response of GCR irradiation in the mature model (Fig. 9a). Fig. 9. Antagomir countermeasure mitigates increases in innate immune activity. Open in a new tab a Lollipop plot of GSEA analysis on RNA-seq data using a custom curation of innate and adaptive immune pathways for mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models.

Heatmaps of the t-scores for the individual genes in the b innate and c adaptive immune custom pathways. (*p-value < 0.05). For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.In mature 3D microvessel models, GCR radiation treatment significantly upregulated several interferon-driven sensitive genes (ISGs), including DDX58, IFIH1, IFIT2, and to a lesser extent, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1-2 amongst others (Fig. 9b). Also upregulated by GCR radiation treatment were the cytokine/chemokine genes CXCL10 and CXCL11, which function as pro-inflammatory molecules associated with activation, differentiation, and chemotaxis of immune cells. In contrast, treatment with the antagomirs produced decreased levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 and of all these ISG genes except for IFIH1 and OAS2. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex formed by NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 that plays a pivotal role in regulating the innate immune system and inflammatory signaling. Upon activation by cytosolic danger signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome activates CASP1 triggering the maturation of IL-1β, NF-κB activation, and the initiation of cell death via GSDMB52. GCR-treated cell cultures significantly upregulated NLRP3 and, to a lesser extent PYCARD, CASP1, and NFKB1, while treatment with antagomirs lessened the induction of these genes (Fig. 9b). Together, the increases in ISGs, cytokines/chemokines and NLRP3 inflammasome indicate that GCR radiation exposure promotes a robust innate immune response associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules and immune cell activation. In contrast, the antagomir treatment downregulates and restores these factors back to normal levels. The adaptive immune genes were not significantly altered, consistent with the transient cell stress induced by the GCR treatment and potentially due to the fact that the 3D cell model does not contain any T cells (Fig. 9c). Mitochondrial damage mitigation after antagomir treatment with space radiation Mitochondrial stress has been previously implicated as a critical and consistently dysregulated phenotype during spaceflight12. Mitochondria play a crucial role in metabolism by integrating signals from stress and the environment, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, to coordinate cellular metabolism53. Thus, the MitoPathways collection54 was used to examine mitochondria-related activity in our 3D cell culture model. GCR exposure combined with antagomir treatment in the mature microvessels significantly decreased expression of 106 of 149 available genesets (Fig. 10a). Radiation exposure alone did not significantly alter 72 of these genesets as highlighted in Fig. 10b. Fig. 10.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.The largest of six major networks involves metabolism-linked MitoPathways where antagomirs with GCR exposure overwhelmingly downregulated 44 of 50 genesets (Fig. 10b). Negative enrichment in 8 of 9 subpathways are associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, metal, vitamin, and sulfur metabolism as well as detoxification. The substantial metabolic alterations may depend on the changes affecting the mitochondria which were also largely downregulated indicating an overall decrease in cellular energetics. The OXPHOS and Mitochondrial Central Dogma MitoPathways include crucial factors for oxidative phosphorylation functions (Complexes I-V subunits and assembly factors) and proteins encoded within mitochondrial DNA and factors involved in their expression, respectively. These genesets were nearly all decreased when antagomirs were added to the radiation exposure. The increased enrichment of 7 subpathways by radiation treatment alone (OXPHOS and OXPHOS subunits, CI and CV subunits, Complex I, Mitochondrial Ribosome, and Translation) was completely reversed with the antagomirs. In response to stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR) to restore cellular homeostasis via communication between organelles55. The communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is essential for cellular homeostasis42, due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nucleus. Considering the observed decrease in mitochondrial and changes in stress pathways, the ISR genes were examined in more detail. GCR exposure in the mature 3D cell cultures downregulated ISR genes involved in amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, death factors, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER-UPR) activation, and lipid metabolism, while only ISR survival genes were positivity enriched (Fig. 10c). Fewer genesets were affected by GCR exposure, which increased the ATF4 targets geneset and decreased ER-homeostasis. Initiation of the ISR is driven by the activation of the kinases HRI (EIF2AK1), PKR (EIF2AK2), PERK (EIF2AK3), or GCN2 (EIK2AK4) which occurs in the mature cell model with GCR radiation (Fig. 10d). These kinases phosphorylate eIF2α, impairing cytosolic protein synthesis and activating expression of the ISR transcription factors ATF4, ATF5, and CHOP. Increased levels of ATF4, ATF5, and CHOP in the angiogenesis cell model (Fig. 10c, d) induce the expression of the downstream ISR-target genes involved in redox maintenance, lipid metabolism, amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, ER-homeostasis, death, survival, and the ER and mitochondrial UPR. For irradiation combined with the antagomirs, genesets are returned to baseline. These results suggest that cells activate ISR as an adaptive cellular response after exposure to space radiation, whereas this activation is prevented by the antagomirs (Fig. 10d).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our previous study13–15 demonstrated a significant association between circulating miRNAs and spaceflight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellular differentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival13,15. Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during spaceflight13,15,56. A collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation13,21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions57. GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles58,59. Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality (e.g. LET)20. The mixed simplified simulation of GCR uses five ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron)48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis14. Several studies have shown the cellular consequences of miRNA activity, including the three miRNAs researched in the present study. Let-7a is involved in many cellular processes, immunity, and protective functions60. The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, but its role in inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and/or stroke are not well understood61. Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation by blocking the TGFβ pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling62. MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies63 and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity64. The targets of miR-16 may be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)65, numerous genes involved in the G1-S transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A)66. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), were identified by bioinformatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets by miR-1667. The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation68 and the occurrence and development of cancer69. In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot be ignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development and differentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts70. Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processes such as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis70. A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs)71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calcifications72. All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24 h after GCR irradiation and 48 h after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids, and cholesterol metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism21 by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signaling. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general inflammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each gene has functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence73. XPO6 and SLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments, a process involved in early responses to cell stressors74,75. PDPR regulates pyruvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions that require a higher energy output76. Overall it appears that several pathways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into a more healthy and active biological state. Changes in immune response appear to be a hallmark of space radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown that cytotoxic and helper T cells are suppressed and key innate immune response-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL/6 female mice exposed to 0.5 Gy GCR irradiation14. Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, k) also indicate dysregulation occurring during spaceflight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate a parallelism that gives confidence about using the 3D cell culture model to confirm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to prevent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Spaceflight can affect mitochondrial stability12. The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed a rescue-like effect (Fig. 10). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insufficient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents77. Electron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to inflammation. Specifically, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex I, complex V, and other OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is a potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia50,51. This suggests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the previously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population (fibroblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe a significant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Many orphan genes were upregulated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processes that are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simple proteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such as transcription factors or receptors31,78. Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance to stress30,31,79–82, however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evolution of a specialized catalytic site82. Many orphan genes are expressed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under specific abiotic stresses or diseases30,32,79,82,83. The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space environment, it can be limiting and difficult to simulate perfectly the conditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration spaceflights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astronaut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during spaceflight are key to meaningful interpretation of biological results applicable to space flight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is a simplified system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that when endothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (during angiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvessels to stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting a pericytic-type phenotype84–86. To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis, it might be necessary, in a close future, to complexify the model, at least toward a multicellular compartment87. In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue model utilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited these three miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature and angiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely prevented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel development caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modified DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers a unique target for the development of radiation countermeasures for spaceflight as well as for terrestrial applications.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166944 PMID: 38862542 Abstract Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage. Subject terms: Systems analysis, Predictive markers, Cardiology In space radiation-exposed cells, targeting specific microRNAs with antagomirs can reduce cardiovascular damage and improve cellular function. Here the authors describe a reduction in inflammation and DNA double-strand break activity within these cells upon antagomir treatment.Introduction The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity fields, and prolonged isolation in a hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of spaceflight crews. The biological consequences of spaceflight also present a unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially3–5. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non-autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can be used as biomarkers6,7, and are associated with human diseases8–10. We have extensively characterized a circulating miRNA signature associated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3D human-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure11–14. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thymus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space-flown animal models11 and revealed a conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovascular system and was widely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvessel collapse13 and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15 caused by space radiation exposure. Multi-omic analyses of biomedical profiles of astronauts along with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to spaceflight-associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mitochondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellular metabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscular and neurological disorders16. Here, a 3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularly focusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved with cardiovascular damage. We find that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we confirm the specific targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study17, a JAXA mission18, and the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as countermeasures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate spaceflight damage and reduce human health risks in human spaceflight missions.Results Combined antagomir inhibition is effective in counteracting space radiation damage We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p in a 3D human microvasculature model. Firstly, we examined the effect of individual miRNAs to mitigate structural damage caused by space radiation exposure from simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The morphology of mature microvessels representing post-mitotic cells with characteristics of the endothelial barrier (tight junctions) was preserved by inhibiting any of the three key miRNAs (Fig. 1a, c). A single dose of each individual antagomir 24 h before GCR irradiation was sufficient to protect microvessels although the combination of the three was more effective. Furthermore, the inhibition by each miRNA was comparable to the unirradiated controls. Fig. 1. Antagomir treatment of 3D human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) microvessel cell cultures. Open in a new tab a, b Quantification of formation of microvessels using 3D cultures of human microvessels irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated galactic cosmic rays (GCR) compared to sham irradiated samples. Irradiated cultures were treated with or without antagomir-induced inhibition of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and/or let-7a-5p. For the boxplots the center line represents the median and the lines extending from both ends of the box indicates the quartile (Q) variability outside Q1 and Q3 to the minimum and maximum values. a mature and b angiogenesis microvessels. The p-values were determined by two-side multiple pairwise comparison. c Mature and angiogenesis microvessels fixed and fluorescently stained with 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF) after GCR irradiation, with or without antagomirs 24 h prior to irradiation. Scale bar = 100 µm. For mature the following biological independent samples were used: n = 17 for 0 Gy, n = 18 for 0.5 Gy, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 16 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir. For angiogenesis the following biological independent samples were performed: n = 18 for 0 Gy, n = 20 for 0.5 Gy, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 11 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 10 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir.A similar result was found for the longer multistage development of microvessels undergoing angiogenesis. In this model, cells were exposed to GCR on culture day 1, when they were still individual and not connected; while the irradiation effects were seen on day 6, when the endothelial cells should have been formed into mature microvessels (Fig. 1b, c). Individual antagomirs applied on days 2 and 3 restore angiogenesis at levels comparable to controls, and combined antagomirs exert an improved protective role (Fig. 1b). In both models, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p are similarly effective at counteracting the effects of space radiation, but the antagomir combination inhibition of the three miRNAs provides a stronger and more robust response. Hereafter, we focus on the biological changes occurring when inhibiting all three miRNAs.Combined antagomir inhibition protects microvessels from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by space radiation While the biological consequences of GCR exposure on mature and developing microvessels are clearly observed 24 h and 7 days after irradiation, respectively, examination of earlier endpoints would enable us to understand the impact of antagomir treatment. Since DNA is the primary target damaged by radiation, early effects from miRNA inhibition on DNA damage and repair were investigated. As the repair of DNA DSB damage by space radiation is pivotal for cellular function, we assessed the cellular proteins involved in DNA DSB repair targeted by miRNA inhibition. Many of the DNA DSB repair genes are common targets of the miRNAs as shown by a network representation for the perturbation effects of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5p (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in activating the DNA DSB repair pathways induced by GCR irradiation. Fig. 2. Quantification of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair foci with antagomir treatment and miRNA pathway analysis.

Immunocytochemical staining for the tumor suppressor p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) was quantified following antagomir treatment 90 min after GCR irradiation (Fig. 2b). The 53BP1 protein accumulates at the site DNA DSBs after irradiation, and the resulting repair foci can be measured as a critical platform for DNA DSB repair activity20. The peak DNA repair foci often occurs around 30 min after gamma irradiation and our previous publications showed that foci induced by charged particles decline over several hours in the human microvasculature model21. Our current analysis shows a significant increase in DNA DSB repair foci (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the antagomir treatment significantly decreased the number of foci to levels similar to the unirradiated condition. This demonstrates that the antagomirs protect microvasculature cells from DNA DSBs caused by space radiation at much earlier times due to potentially providing a more efficient DNA repair mechanism. The changes in expression of miRNAs after GCR exposure and its relationship to DNA repair mechanisms is not widely understood22. To determine if DNA DSBs are associated with a global response from those evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that we observed in vivo, we exposed C57BL/6 female mice to 0.5 Gy of GCR and performed miRNA-sequencing on the plasma, liver, soleus muscle, and heart (Fig. 2c, d). From pathway analysis23 of DNA DSB and repair pathways, we observed a comprehensive increase in DNA DSB genesets across all four tissues from the measured changes in miRNA expression. The global increase associated with overall miRNA activity following GCR irradiation further supports the key roles of these miRNAs in the DNA DSB repair pathways.Space radiation reveals key regulation of the three miRNAs in specific tissues To further establish miRNA changes after space radiation and the importance of miR-16, miR-125b, and let-7a with cardiovascular health risks, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the miRNA-seq data from the mice exposed to 0.5 Gy of GCR (Fig. 3)24. WGCNA classically was designed for transcriptomic RNA-seq data, but recently has proven its utility in miRNA-seq data25,26. Hence, we utilized WGCNA to determine key miRNA networks that are impacted by space radiation and how they are affected in the heart, liver, soleus muscle, and plasma of mice. The WGCNA analysis revealed three distinct miRNA networks (i.e., “Modules” or “ME”) that are most strongly impacted by GCR radiation, depending on the tissue type (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 3a–c). Interestingly, for all three Modules the heart tissue showed the most significant decrease comparing GCR irradiated mice to sham (Fig. 3a–c). For Module 0 (Figs. 3a) and 2 (Fig. 3c), the liver shows a significant increase. When observing the key miRNAs involved in each module we see that let-7a-5p is present in Module 0 (Fig. 3d), miR-16-5p in Module 1 (Fig. 3e), and miR-15b-5p in Module 2 (Fig. 3f). The individual miRNAs within each Module were differential expressed due to GCR radiation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 3.

We performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the mature microvessel and angiogenesis models after 0.5 Gy of GCR exposure and compared conditions with or without the combination of antagomirs (Fig. 4). The experimental design for the antagomir treatment is depicted in Fig. 4a. The antagomir treatment and endpoints after irradiation differ between the two models as described in Malkani et al.13 for the mature microvessel model and Wuu et al.15 for the angiogenesis model.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. The adj. p-value plots are also provided in Supplementary Fig. 3.Global transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq results revealed key patterns associated to antagomir treatment after GCR irradiation. Overall, antagomir treated samples post-irradiation clustered closer to the sham unirradiated samples for both microvessel cell cultures (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the antagomir treatment had a substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels. Of note, we are utilizing p-value statistics for our main analysis and acknowledge that this may result in the potential of more false positives, but we believe that the information generated by lowering the statistical significance will produce more meaningful data and previous literature also provided further justification when necessary to utilize p-values27,28. In addition, we have also provided the adj. p-value analysis for full transparency of our results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the global clustering of both models demonstrates a restoration closer to the basal levels, there are measurable differences between the two models with GCR irradiation alone and GCR with the antagomirs. This is apparent when observing the transcriptomic patterns for the significantly regulated genes (Fig. 4c). GCR irradiation caused a greater number of genes to be differentially regulated for the mature vessel compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 4d, e). Antagomir treatment during irradiation in mature (before) or in angiogenesis cells (after) caused significant dysregulation in both models (Fig. 4d, e). Substantially more genes were uniquely altered in the angiogenesis compared to the mature microvessel model (Fig. 4f), as may be expected since the endpoint is much longer than in the mature microvessel model and encompasses multiple stages of development. We also identified a set of orphan genes to be differentially regulated in GCR-stressed samples and reversed by antagomir treatment. Orphan genes code for proteins that are unique to a species29–31 and may provide a major source of evolutionary novelty conferring beneficial traits to a species. Evidence-based (EB) orphan genes were identified by Singh32 based on a comprehensive analysis of 27,000 RNA-Seq datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project. To determine how human orphan genes respond to space radiation and antagomir treatment, differential expression of orphan genes was assessed in the RNA-seq data. In both models, tens of orphan genes were differentially expressed by space irradiation plus antagomirs, but not with radiation alone (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 4). Since orphan genes often integrate themselves into metabolic and regulatory networks31,33,34, these could play a role in the dysregulation of DNA repair and metabolic pathways associated with response to space radiation and antagomir treatment observed here. To better identify dysregulated genes targeted by the antagomirs, we used miRNA target analysis by the mirDIP algorithm35 to assess transcripts downregulated by irradiation but restored after antagomir treatment. Twenty-one gene targets, including PDPR, APAF1, XPO6, NIBAN1, and SLC7A1, were predicted to be simultaneous targets of each miRNA (Fig. 5a). To validate the key genes, we performed PCR on 8 of the 21 genes from the same isolated RNA utilized for the RNA-seq (Fig. 5b). We see that all the genes are in agreement with the RNA-seq data except for MSH5, which we see an upregulation with 0.5 Gy and then the expression returns back to 0 Gy levels after antagomir treatment. We investigated how well the miRNAs bound to the 21 gene targets (“antagomir-rescued genes”), and the log2 fold change from the RNA-seq data after GCR exposure. We observed that the three miRNAs bound to the 3’-UTR and CDS regions of 15 (Fig. 5c) and 13 (Fig. 5d) out of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes, respectively, whereas let-7a-5p and miR-125b-5p bound only to two of the target genes (Fig. 5e).

We have also provided the details for the experimental evidence from these databases in Supplementary Table 1. The *mirDIP gene targets for each miRNA as shown in panel a.

Figure 5f shows that the 21 antagomir-rescued genes with 7-8mer 3’-UTR sites had a significant propensity to be downregulated compared to those without 3’-UTR sites (P = 4.99e−07, 2.65e−32 and 6.31e−09 for 8mer, 7mer-m8 and 7mer-A1, respectively, using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). These results indicate that miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p play a key role in the downregulation of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes. Figure 5g, h shows that the downregulation of these genes is drastically reduced under antagomir treatment, indicating that by inhibiting these 3 miRNAs, expression of these genes reverts towards the control (0 Gy) levels. Pathway analysis of the antagomir-restored transcripts targeted by one or more of the three miRNA shows an enrichment pattern for expression of genes associated with apoptosis and TP53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, alteration of these pathways may account for the observed preservation of the 3D microvessels by antagomir treatment with GCR exposure. To confirm that these 21 genes are actual targets for the three miRNAs we dissected the pathways involved with the mirDIP algorithm analysis and also provided experimental evidence from current databases and literature. While mirDIP draws from a comprehensive pool of 24 databases to evaluate miRNA targets35, our focus was on the analysis of the six most reputable databases among them (Fig. 5i). Additionally, we corroborated the experimental validation of these gene targets by cross-referencing data from three databases (i.e. miRTarBase37, TarBase38, and starBase39) alongside pertinent literature references (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Table 1). Our results indicate robust experimental validation of gene targets for the three miRNAs as follows: 10 out of 10 for miR-16-5p, 13 out of 14 for let-7a-5p, and 9 out of 15 for miR-125b-5p. It’s worth noting that while the validation rate for miR-125b-5p stands at 60% based on these databases, certain contextual conditions may influence the validation of gene targets for miRNAs. Nevertheless, our additional experimental evidence (Fig. 5b–h) enhances the confidence in our findings. Finally, it is crucial to assess the conservation of these three miRNAs between humans and mice. It is well-established that miRNAs exhibit high levels of conservation across species, particularly between mice and humans40. Our analysis demonstrates 100% conservation of all three mature miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, miR-125p-5p, and let-7a-5p) and their precursor forms have conservation rates greater than 95% between mouse and human genomes (Fig. 5j). Given the robust conservation observed, comparisons between results obtained in mouse and human contexts can be easily facilitated.Regulation of antagomir-rescued genes in astronauts The relevance to humans of the 21 genes that are rescued by the antagomir countermeasures in the 3D human tissues (Fig. 6a) were further examined using data from the NASA Twin Study17 (REF) (Fig. 6a–d), Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study18 of astronauts that were in space for 120 days (Fig. 6e, f), as well as data from the first civilian commercial 3-day spaceflight mission, referred to as Inspiration4 (I4)19 (Fig. 6g–s). The NASA Twin Study has been described in several papers which compared two identical twins with one Twin on the ISS for 340 days and the other twin on Earth12,17. The JAXA study conducted RNA-seq on plasma cell-free RNAs from six astronauts who were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days, sampled from pre-flight, during flight, and post-flight time points. The I4 mission performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on the blood and also RNA-seq skin biopsies which involved 4 astronauts (two males and two females) that orbited at low Earth orbit (LEO) at 590 km above the atmosphere (Fig. 6f). The I4 mission occurred at a much higher altitude than the ISS, thus the I4 astronauts experienced a higher accumulated dose of radiation compared to being on the ISS. It is important to note that the estimated accumulated doses of space radiation that the astronauts were exposed to for these missions were lower than 0.5 Gy (which is the estimated dose for a trip to Mars and back), but despite this we still observed key changes as we will describe below. The following are the accumulated doses that were measured for each mission: NASA Twin Study astronaut received 146.34 mSv or 14.634 cGy17, I4 astronauts received 4.72 mSv or 0.472 cGy19, and for the JAXA astronauts we estimated that they had received an accumulated dose of 51.60 mSv or 5.16 cGy (the dosimetry was not reported for this mission and this is an estimate based on the average dose received per month from other missions)18.

The values shown are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts for each time point during flight and post-flight. The three pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values.

There are individual gene variations observed from preflight to the last time point after return (i.e. R + 200 days), but the overall gene signature changes will indicate how these genes will be impacted by the three miRNAs. The global changes for these 21 genes over time is best observed with cumulative plots for the different cell types for the Twin in space over time (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Fig. 7a). It was observed that the only cell type to show significant changes for the 21 genes from flight to return on Earth were the lymphocyte depleted cells or monocytes (Fig. 7a). We show that for flight vs pre-flight and R + 1 vs pre-flight (i.e. immediately after return to Earth) there was significant downregulation for these key genes and then at 34 days and beyond, the genes have returned back to the control pre-flight expression. Fig. 7. The interaction of the three miRNAs with the 21 gene targets from the NASA Twin Study in Monocytes. Open in a new tab a Cumulative plots for change over time with the 21 genes targeted by the three miRNAs using RNA-seq data from the NASA Twin Study data. Sequencing was performed on lymphocyte depleted cells (i.e. monocytes) from the Twin that was onboard the ISS for 340 days. There are comparisons over time starting with Flight versus Pre-Flight as well as comparing the different Return (R) to Earth timepoints from 1 to 200 days versus Pre-Flight. b Correlation plot of the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-125b-5p) and the 21 gene targets for the overlapping time points from the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq NASA Twin Study data. The gene targets for the miRNAs are indicated in the outer black (yes for gene target) and gray (no for gene target) rows and columns. Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value and significance for the correlation is shown by *p-value < 0.05.To establish the direct relationship between the 21 gene targets and the three miRNAs, we utilized the NASA Twin Study which had both miRNA- and mRNA-seq data associated with the mission and cell types. Similar to the cumulative plots, we observed the correlation between the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16, let-7a, and miR-125b) with the 21 gene targets in the four different cell types (i.e. CD4, CD8, CD19, and monocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We correlated with the overlapping time points per each sample type and observed for the majority of the miRNAs and genes targets an inverse relationship. Specifically, for monocytes for the specific gene targets the miRNAs had an inverse correlation (Fig. 7b). Since the miRNAs will traditionally silence the specific gene target, this result is what we would expect and provides further validation in astronauts that these miRNAs in circulation will be ideal targets to reduce health risks as our in vitro results show. We noticed that most of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes in the JAXA data were downregulated during the flight, indicating that increased activity of the let-7a-5p, mir-125b-5p, and mir-16-5p might cause the suppression of these target genes in astronauts (Fig. 6e). Most of the genes show up-regulation post-flight as compared to pre-flight and during flight (Fig. 6e). This is consistent with the i4 data, in which antagomir-rescued gene activity is significantly increased post-flight compared to the pre-flight in most of the cell types sampled from the astronauts (Fig. 6c). The ratio of up-regulation in these selected 21 antagomir-rescued genes is more significant than the average up-regulation ratio of all genes (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that this subset is more susceptible to expression change due to the space environment. Cell-dependent differences are detectable for specific genes during spaceflight for the I4 astronauts data (Fig. 6e–n and Supplementary Fig. 6). Two genes, ARL6IP6 (ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase 6 Interacting Protein 6) and TSEN15 (TRNA Splicing Endonuclease Subunit 15), are significantly up-regulated post-flight compared to pre-flight in eight of the ten cell types, with CD16+ cells and dendritic cells (DCs) not significantly different for ARL6IP6 and CD14+ cells, and DCs not significantly different for TSEN15. ARL6IP6 is involved in ischemic strokes in patients41, which could have implications related to microvessel damage in space. In murine stem cells, ARL6IP6 exhibits properties of regulating nuclear envelope structure, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear envelope resealing and repair42. TSEN15 is involved in tRNA splicing and intron removal fundamental processes for cell growth and division43. It has been implicated in hypoplasia (the impairment in development of tissues and organs due to the decrease in cell number)44. Specifically, TSEN15 has been shown to cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and progressive microcephaly. Although this occurs at an early stage of life (i.e. infants), one could speculate that TSEN15 may play important roles in cell proliferation in adults. Interestingly, TSEN15 has also been associated with autoinflammatory neurodegenerative diseases45. ARL6IP6 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6) is predicted to be targeted by miR-125b-5p and let-7a-5p and TSEN15 is predicted to be targeted by miR-16-5p and let-7a-5 (Fig. 5). Skin biopsies from the i4 astronauts were also used for RNA-seq comparing post-flight to pre-flight (Fig. 6s) with four different skin regions in the analysis: Outer Epidermis (OE), Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA). The VA compartment is closely related to the 3D microvessel cell models which seems to produce the strongest regulation of the 21 key genes. ARL6IP6 is upregulated in the VA for post-flight compared to pre-flight similar to what is observed in the blood (Fig. 6i–r), while TSEN15 is downregulated. Interestingly, 57%, 52%, and 52% of the 21 genes were downregulated for the OE, IE, and VA regions, while for the OD region only 38% were downregulated. Overall, for all the astronaut data, the measured changes of these genes from ex vivo cellular samples may suggest that an interventional treatment with the three antagomirs might lead to improved astronaut health.Major cellular pathways altered by radiation exposure and rescued by antagomir treatment To determine the key pathways that are altered by radiation with or without antagomir treatment, we performed pathway analysis on the bulk RNA-seq data via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Using the Hallmark database46, general pathway enrichments were more pronounced in the mature microvessels compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 8a, b). Radiation exposure in both these models triggered positive enrichment of pathways typically observed from this treatment such as TP53, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-alpha signaling. For both the mature microvessel and angiogenesis cellular models, there was a significantly decreased enrichment associated with the mitotic spindle due to radiation exposure that was reversed by the antagomir treatment. This is consistent with the fact that cellular death following radiation exposure may occur through mitotic catastrophe due to failure of mitotic spindle checkpoints47. Fig. 8. Pathway analysis on the mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models revealing key functions being mitigated by the antagomirs after exposure to GCR irradiation. Open in a new tab Lollipop plots showing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis of the Hallmark pathways for a mature and b angiogenesis 3D cell culture models.

Only significantly regulated pathways with FDR < 0.05 are shown. The nominal enrichment score (NES) represents the relative degree a gene set is changed and is corrected for gene set size.An increase in inflammatory-related genes and pathways after irradiation is a common occurrence driving the late effects of radiation injury48,49. Radiation exposure with antagomir treatment caused a significant reversal in enrichment for several of these pathways. Strikingly, in both mature and angiogenesis microvessels, pathways for an inflammatory response, TNF-alpha signaling, interferon responses, and IL-6 are significantly decreased by the addition of antagomirs (Fig. 8a, b). Pathways for hypoxia, DNA repair, and oxidative phosphorylation are also activated with the GCR treatment while the antagomir treatment inhibits these pathways. The antagomirs also restored the suppression associated with cell cycle observed with space radiation for the angiogenesis model (Fig. 7b). As a result, the antagomirs appear to be regulating key pathways in the radiation response that may be essential in assisting repair of the damage caused by space radiation in the mature microvasculature. To further explore the consequences of antagomir treatment to radiation exposure, Reactome genesets consisting of 26 super pathways were examined (Fig. 8c, d). Positively or negatively enriched genesets in the same direction by irradiation with or without antagomirs were excluded. The remaining genesets have opposing enrichments or are enriched by only one treatment. These pathways may represent critical targets that provide beneficial effects from antagomir treatment. Genes involved in DNA repair by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) are enriched in mature microvessels after radiation exposure (Fig. 8c). However, adding antagomirs suppresses these changes as well as changes in genes linked to DNA damage bypass via translation synthesis. This was accompanied by a decrease in pathways involved in cellular stress [e.g. genesets for heme oxygenase 1, hypoxia, detoxification of ROS, EIF2AK4 (GCN2) amino acid deficiencies] as well as a decrease in cell cycle control including telomere maintenance. Notably, there was an overall increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization with the irradiation and antagomirs that was not statistically significant with radiation alone. Earlier during the angiogenesis phase of the microvessels, irradiation overwhelmingly decreased cell cycle genesets while the addition of the antagomirs abolished this statistically significant manifestation (Fig. 8d). DNA replication as well as DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination was also returned to non-significant control levels by antagomir treatment. DNA damage, inflammation, stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are normally associated with the induction of cellular senescence48. Therefore, we used publicly available databases compiling markers of cellular senescence50,51 to investigate whether GCR caused senescence and the antagomirs protected the 3D human microvasculature model from it. Curiously, most senescence pathways were suppressed by GCR, except for oncogene-induced senescence (Supplementary Fig. 8). This is consistent with upregulation of TP53 target genes, although it dissociates oncogene induction from other causes of senescence induction. The antagomirs did not revert these phenotypes, except in the angiogenesis model, where they promoted cellular senescence in GCR-exposed cells.Antagomir treatment after space radiation modulates critical cellular pathways To specifically observe how key immune and inflammatory pathways are regulated with and without the antagomir treatment in the space environment, we analyzed a custom curation of genesets for innate and adaptive immune pathways (Fig. 9). There was an overall increased activity with GCR radiation exposure for the mature microvessel culture. However, when the antagomirs were applied, general inflammatory and immune pathways were restored back to the 0 Gy level for the mature microvessel model with a negative regulation in the angiogenesis cell model indicating that this countermeasure treatment diminished this response of GCR irradiation in the mature model (Fig. 9a). Fig. 9. Antagomir countermeasure mitigates increases in innate immune activity. Open in a new tab a Lollipop plot of GSEA analysis on RNA-seq data using a custom curation of innate and adaptive immune pathways for mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models.

Heatmaps of the t-scores for the individual genes in the b innate and c adaptive immune custom pathways. (*p-value < 0.05). For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.In mature 3D microvessel models, GCR radiation treatment significantly upregulated several interferon-driven sensitive genes (ISGs), including DDX58, IFIH1, IFIT2, and to a lesser extent, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1-2 amongst others (Fig. 9b). Also upregulated by GCR radiation treatment were the cytokine/chemokine genes CXCL10 and CXCL11, which function as pro-inflammatory molecules associated with activation, differentiation, and chemotaxis of immune cells. In contrast, treatment with the antagomirs produced decreased levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 and of all these ISG genes except for IFIH1 and OAS2. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex formed by NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 that plays a pivotal role in regulating the innate immune system and inflammatory signaling. Upon activation by cytosolic danger signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome activates CASP1 triggering the maturation of IL-1β, NF-κB activation, and the initiation of cell death via GSDMB52. GCR-treated cell cultures significantly upregulated NLRP3 and, to a lesser extent PYCARD, CASP1, and NFKB1, while treatment with antagomirs lessened the induction of these genes (Fig. 9b). Together, the increases in ISGs, cytokines/chemokines and NLRP3 inflammasome indicate that GCR radiation exposure promotes a robust innate immune response associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules and immune cell activation. In contrast, the antagomir treatment downregulates and restores these factors back to normal levels. The adaptive immune genes were not significantly altered, consistent with the transient cell stress induced by the GCR treatment and potentially due to the fact that the 3D cell model does not contain any T cells (Fig. 9c).Mitochondrial damage mitigation after antagomir treatment with space radiation Mitochondrial stress has been previously implicated as a critical and consistently dysregulated phenotype during spaceflight12. Mitochondria play a crucial role in metabolism by integrating signals from stress and the environment, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, to coordinate cellular metabolism53. Thus, the MitoPathways collection54 was used to examine mitochondria-related activity in our 3D cell culture model. GCR exposure combined with antagomir treatment in the mature microvessels significantly decreased expression of 106 of 149 available genesets (Fig. 10a). Radiation exposure alone did not significantly alter 72 of these genesets as highlighted in Fig. 10b. Fig. 10. Mitigation of mitochondrial dysregulation and integrated stress response (ISR) with antagomir treatment on mature and angiogenesis 3D cell culture models irradiated with GCR.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value.The largest of six major networks involves metabolism-linked MitoPathways where antagomirs with GCR exposure overwhelmingly downregulated 44 of 50 genesets (Fig. 10b). Negative enrichment in 8 of 9 subpathways are associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, metal, vitamin, and sulfur metabolism as well as detoxification. The substantial metabolic alterations may depend on the changes affecting the mitochondria which were also largely downregulated indicating an overall decrease in cellular energetics. The OXPHOS and Mitochondrial Central Dogma MitoPathways include crucial factors for oxidative phosphorylation functions (Complexes I-V subunits and assembly factors) and proteins encoded within mitochondrial DNA and factors involved in their expression, respectively. These genesets were nearly all decreased when antagomirs were added to the radiation exposure. The increased enrichment of 7 subpathways by radiation treatment alone (OXPHOS and OXPHOS subunits, CI and CV subunits, Complex I, Mitochondrial Ribosome, and Translation) was completely reversed with the antagomirs. In response to stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR) to restore cellular homeostasis via communication between organelles55. The communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is essential for cellular homeostasis42, due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nucleus. Considering the observed decrease in mitochondrial and changes in stress pathways, the ISR genes were examined in more detail. GCR exposure in the mature 3D cell cultures downregulated ISR genes involved in amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, death factors, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER-UPR) activation, and lipid metabolism, while only ISR survival genes were positivity enriched (Fig. 10c). Fewer genesets were affected by GCR exposure, which increased the ATF4 targets geneset and decreased ER-homeostasis. Initiation of the ISR is driven by the activation of the kinases HRI (EIF2AK1), PKR (EIF2AK2), PERK (EIF2AK3), or GCN2 (EIK2AK4) which occurs in the mature cell model with GCR radiation (Fig. 10d). These kinases phosphorylate eIF2α, impairing cytosolic protein synthesis and activating expression of the ISR transcription factors ATF4, ATF5, and CHOP. Increased levels of ATF4, ATF5, and CHOP in the angiogenesis cell model (Fig. 10c, d) induce the expression of the downstream ISR-target genes involved in redox maintenance, lipid metabolism, amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, ER-homeostasis, death, survival, and the ER and mitochondrial UPR. For irradiation combined with the antagomirs, genesets are returned to baseline. These results suggest that cells activate ISR as an adaptive cellular response after exposure to space radiation, whereas this activation is prevented by the antagomirs (Fig. 10d).Discussion Our previous study13–15 demonstrated a significant association between circulating miRNAs and spaceflight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellular differentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival13,15. Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during spaceflight13,15,56. A collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation13,21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions57. GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles58,59. Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality (e.g. LET)20. The mixed simplified simulation of GCR uses five ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron)48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis14. Several studies have shown the cellular consequences of miRNA activity, including the three miRNAs researched in the present study. Let-7a is involved in many cellular processes, immunity, and protective functions60. The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, but its role in inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and/or stroke are not well understood61. Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation by blocking the TGFβ pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling62. MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies63 and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity64. The targets of miR-16 may be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)65, numerous genes involved in the G1-S transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A)66. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), were identified by bioinformatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets by miR-1667. The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation68 and the occurrence and development of cancer69. In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot be ignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development and differentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts70. Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processes such as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis70. A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs)71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calcifications72. All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24 h after GCR irradiation and 48 h after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids, and cholesterol metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism21 by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signaling. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general inflammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each gene has functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence73. XPO6 and SLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments, a process involved in early responses to cell stressors74,75. PDPR regulates pyruvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions that require a higher energy output76. Overall it appears that several pathways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into a more healthy and active biological state. Changes in immune response appear to be a hallmark of space radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown that cytotoxic and helper T cells are suppressed and key innate immune response-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL/6 female mice exposed to 0.5 Gy GCR irradiation14. Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, k) also indicate dysregulation occurring during spaceflight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate a parallelism that gives confidence about using the 3D cell culture model to confirm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to prevent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Spaceflight can affect mitochondrial stability12. The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed a rescue-like effect (Fig. 10). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insufficient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents77. Electron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to inflammation. Specifically, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex I, complex V, and other OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is a potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia50,51. This suggests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the previously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population (fibroblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe a significant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Many orphan genes were upregulated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processes that are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simple proteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such as transcription factors or receptors31,78. Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance to stress30,31,79–82, however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evolution of a specialized catalytic site82. Many orphan genes are expressed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under specific abiotic stresses or diseases30,32,79,82,83. The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space environment, it can be limiting and difficult to simulate perfectly the conditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration spaceflights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astronaut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during spaceflight are key to meaningful interpretation of biological results applicable to space flight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is a simplified system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that when endothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (during angiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvessels to stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting a pericytic-type phenotype84–86. To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis, it might be necessary, in a close future, to complexify the model, at least toward a multicellular compartment87. In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue model utilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited these three miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature and angiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely prevented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel development caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modified DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers a unique target for the development of radiation countermeasures for spaceflight as well as for terrestrial applications.Methods Ethical statement All mice experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory’s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values.Cell culture Prior to culturing 3D microvessels, HUVEC (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA), primary cells isolated from the vein of the umbilical cord were cultured as 2D monolayers in complete endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ, USA), containing EGM medium (serum free) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine brain extract. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) and the medium was changed twice a week. All cells used for experiments were cells thawed from a fresh vial.3D HUVEC vessel cell model In this study, 3D cell culture was performed according to the method initially described by Davis et al.88 with modifications described in Grabham et al.21. Briefly, a collagen gel solution (Rat tail Collagen Type 1, BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) was prepared on ice by mixing together the following stock solutions: 0.35% collagen solution, 10 Å~ M199 medium, and 1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) in a ratio of 8:1:1 by (volume). This solution was then mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a ratio of 3:1 by (volume). HUVECs grown in EGM on 2D cell culture dishes (80–90% confluence) were detached with a trypsin solution (0.025%) and resuspended in EGM-2 (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA). The cell solution was mixed with the gel solution in a ratio 1:5 (by volume). The resulting cell suspension contained a final cell suspension of 1×106 cells/ml. 25 μl was dropped onto the cell growing surface inside a tissue culture flask (T25) (Corning) and allowed to gel at 37 °C for 30 min. The gel matrices were then overlaid with EGM-2 medium for 7 days with daily media changes. EBM-2 consists of EGM-2 media supplemented with 2% FBS, human fibroblast growth factor B (hFGF-B), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), human vascular endothelial cell growth factor (hVEGF), long R insulin-like growth factor 1 (R3-IGF-1), ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone and heparin. 50 nM Phorbol 12- Myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Millipore Sigma) was also added to the growth media. Cells embedded in 200–300-μm thick gel matrices were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) for the times indicated. The medium was refreshed every 24 h or as otherwise stated in individual experiments. For mature microvessels, cells were cultured for 6 days and treated with AUMantagomirTM (AUM biotech) (0.5 µM each) 24 h before radiation exposure then fixed 24 h later. For the angiogenesis model, cultures were irradiated on day one and cultured for 6 more days before fixation. Preliminary experiments showed that antagomir treatment on days 2 and 3 were most effective. For DNA damage/repair (i.e. 53BP1 staining), cultures were fixed at 90 min after irradiations.Simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure Irradiation of microvessel models and animals were conducted at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Samples were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature. Dosimetry was performed by the NSRL physics staff. For microvessel models, cultures were seeded at Columbia University in New York City then transported to BNL the same day. Irradiations were carried out the following day (Day 1) at NSRL. A 20 cm × 20 cm beam was utilized. Since the heavy-ion beam at NSRL is horizontal, flasks containing 5 ml of medium were upended to a vertical position for a few minutes during irradiation. All cultures were irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated GCR (referred to as GCR). The irradiation was used with ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula for 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n,4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV, in the following proportions – 1000 MeV protons at 34.8%, 250 MeV protons at 39.3%, 28Si at 1.1%, 4He at 18%, 16O at 5.8%, and 56Fe at 1%. This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions48. The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of charged particles although high LET ions generally have a greater relative biological effect (RBE).Quantification of 3D human cell culture models after irradiation: Immunocytochemistry, Imaging, and microvessel analysis All microvessel cultures were fixed and stained as for monolayers. Fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by three washes in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% Triton-X, and finally in PBS. 5-(4,6-Dichlorotriazinyl) Aminofluorescein (DTAF) (Thermofisher Scientific) was used to as a fluorescent green stain for all proteins to visualize microvessels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 53BP1 foci were immunostained using a polyclonal antibody against 53BP1 (Catalog #: NB100-304, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and a counterstain for nuclei with YOYO green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by Alexa fluor conjugates 495 or 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were captured on a Nikon TE 200 confocal C1 microscope with EZ-C1 software. Analysis of images was carried out using  Image J v. 1.44k software68. Initial analysis on microvessels was carried out on randomly selected 20X fields from within the gel matrix. Thresholded images of microvessels were outlined as perimeters then divided by 2 for length measurements. For the improved analysis the field size was increased 4-fold by using images captured by a 10× objective. The mature microvessels were defined more rigorously as those of a minimum diameter of 12.5 μm. This step eliminated many immature thin vessels and reduced the effective doses. Finally, the sample fields were standardized, by imaging microvessels at a constant depth (50 mm above the substrate). All analyses were carried out blind. DNA double strand break repair foci assay was carried out by counting the number of foci per nucleus.MicroRNA predictions of DNA DSB gene targets and network generation We predicted specific DNA DSB genes that are targeted by three miRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p. The DNA DSB gene list was determined by filtering out all DNA DSB related Gene Ontology (GO) pathways46,89. Each GO DNA DSB pathway will have curated genes associated with the pathway. We compiled all genes related to these into a master list and deleted any duplicated genes. We then utilized the ClueGO+CluePedia plugin90,91 in Cytoscape92 to map the relationship between the gene targets for the three miRNAs. This was done by including all DNA DSB genes and the three miRNAs in the initial query list. The edges and connections were made with CluePedia utilizing the following miRNA-mRNA databases in the plugin: CluePedia STRING-Actions (v.11.0_9606_27.02.2019), CluePedia microRNA.org-human predictions_s_O_aug2020, miRDB_v6.0, miRanda-miRNAs v5-2012-07-19, mirTarBase, and mirecords.umn.edu.validated.miRNAs-2010-11-25.Nucleic acid extraction for 3D human cell culture models We used n = 5 biological replicates for each condition for RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gel matrix cryotubes containing the cells of interest were taken out of −80 °C and 1 mL of QIAzol reagent was added to the tubes. Each sample contained 300–800 µL of gel matrix and approximately 500,000 cells. While the gel matrix thawed in QIAzol, the solution was pipetted and vortexed until fully dissolved. The lysate was passed through a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to further homogenize the cells. 100 µL of gDNA eliminator solution was added. The resulting lysate from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30–50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentration of all RNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter93. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).Spike in Protocols before library preparation in 3D cultures ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP 5.2 Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing93.Library construction for RNA-sequencing on 3D cultures RNA ribo-depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > 6.5 (average RIN of 8.7). Index adapters used were at 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 PCR cycles were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit93. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).Bulk RNA-sequencing and data processing on 3D cultures RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp(8 bp index +9 bp UMI), Index2: 8 bp Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX was included as an internal control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers93. Raw fastq files were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) then aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to forward. pyrpipe was used for quantification of the orphan genes and other EB genes23,69. Using DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed separately for the 3 conditions on each 3D microvessel cell culture model. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. The data was normalized twice, each time using a different size factor. The first used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group B genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the log2(Fold-Change) values and the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4), PANTHER.db (v1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (v3.15.0). We have utilized for our analysis a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance and acknowledge the potential of more false positives to occur. All TPM values can be found in Supplemental Data 1. Raw RNA-seq data is available on the NASA OSDR’s Biological Data Management Environment94 with accession number: OSD-577.Determination of the 21 key gene targets for the three miRNAs, cumulative plots for the miRNA targets, and statistical test To determine the 21 key gene targets for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, we found the genes that were statistically significantly downregulated for 0.5 Gy vs 0 Gy and no longer significant for 0.5 Gy with antagomir vs 0 Gy. We then utilized mirDIP95 to determine the gene targets for all 3 miRNAs with a criteria of medium score class. The medium score class has been shown in the literature to provide a reasonable criteria for determining gene targets for miRNAs35. We overlapped these two lists of genes and found 21 genes. The 21 gene fold-change values, statistics, and TPM values can be found in Supplemental Data 2. We used the “Target Mining” function of the online platform miRwalk96. It allowed searching the 21 gene targets against the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16), and investigate their 3’-, 5’-UTR and coding sequence (CDS) regions with a binding probability cutoff of at least 0.75 (Sankey plot part of Fig. 5b–d). To this, we have added the genes’ respective log2 fold change given a GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). To build the cumulative plots for the 21 miRNA gene targets, we obtained the information about whether these genes have 7mer or 8mer sites that match the seed region of each the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16) using the TargetScan v8.0 database97. mRNAs were then grouped according to miRNA seed sequences (7mer-1A, 7mer-m8 or 8mer or ‘no site’), and the cumulative plot was generated using the mRNA log2 fold change values using the ecdfplot method from seaborn98. To compare distributions of mRNA fold change values for each seed match with the ‘no site’ case, we calculated the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test using the kstest function from scipy in python99. To determine the experimental validation for the 21 gene targets to the miRNAs, we utilized three databases which are: miRTarBase v9.037, TarBase v9.038, and StarBase v2.039. Both TarBase and miRTarBase include literature references for the experimental validation. We also provided additional literature references for some genes as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. We displayed these results both in Supplementary Table 1 and as bar plots (Fig. 5j) using ggplot2 (ver 3.3.5).Conserved miRNA analysis between humans and mice Selected precursor and mature miRNA sequences from human and mouse were extracted from miRBase v.22.1100. After BLASTN alignment, conservation between mouse and human sequences was determined as the percentage of aligned nucleotide identities in mature and pre-miRNA sequences.RTPCR on key gene targets Total RNA samples were prepared from the same RNA isolated for the bulk RNA-seq as described above and were DNase I treated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the BioRad iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix. To quantify gene expression of genes using TaqMan probes BioRad iTaq™ Universal Probes Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. To quantify gene expression of genes using DNA probes BioRad iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S were used as an internal reference. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on an BioRad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Instrument. Delta-delta-cycle threshold (ΔΔCT) was determined relative to ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S levels and normalized to control samples. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean from at least three biological replicates.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) For pathway analysis, we utilized fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA)101. Pathway analysis was done utilizing both MSigDB gene sets46 (specifically, Hallmark and KEGG) and custom-made Gene Set files from MitoPathway and expert-curated mitochondrial genes available in89. Using fGSEA, all samples were compared to controls and the ranked list of genes was defined by the t-score statistics. The statistical significance was determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets89. We utilized a statistical cutoff of FDR < 0.05 as recommended by GSEA and lollipop plots were made using ggplot2 (ver 3.3.5). All GSEA data generated for this manuscript can be found in Supplemental Data 3.Murine simulated space environment experiments The murine data utilized here were from experiments previously reported by Malkani et al.13 and Paul et al.14. All experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory’s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and all experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Briefly, n = 80 15-week +/−3-day old, C57Bl/6J wildtype female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12 h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. The normally loaded (NL) mice were originally utilized in parallel experiments with hindlimb unloaded mice which were not reported in this manuscript. Mice were cage acclimated (n = 10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded. Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-h post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for −80 °C storage. A 100 μl aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at −80 °C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1× RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as described below. All organs were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at −80 °C. Body weight tracking was performed on days −3, 0, 7 and 14. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; GCR (0.5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. A 60 × 60 beam was utilized at the NSRL for irradiation. Sham controls were treated similarly to GCR irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simulation, i.e. 25 min.miRNA extraction from murine tissues MiRNA extractions from plasma and all tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (Cat# 217184). MiRNA extractions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat# 217004). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific).miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouse experiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (#217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number >7. Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was used to prepare a small RNA library according to the protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor’s recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASA OSDR’s Biological Data Management Environment with the following identifiers: for all heart tissue related data: OSD-334, DOI: 10.26030/cg2g-as49; for all liver tissue related data: OSD-335, DOI: 10.26030/72ke-1k67: for all soleus muscle related data: OSD-337, DOI: 10.26030/m73g-2477; and for all plasma related data: OSD-336, DOI: 10.26030/qasa-rr29.Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to remove adapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18~26 nucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase 22.0100 by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3’ and 5’ ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p-derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two were defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the flank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: (1) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem (≤12); (2) number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin (≥16); (3) cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol ≤−15); (4) length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop ≥50); (5) length of hairpin loop (≤20); (6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region (≤8); (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤4); (8) number of biased bulges in mature region (≤2); (9) number of errors in mature region (≤7); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12); and (11) percent of mature in stem (≥80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisher exact test, Chi-squared 2 × 2 test, Chi-squared nXn test, Student’s t test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The significance threshold was set to be 0.01 and 0.05 in each test. To determine gene ontology (GO)102 and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs, we performed miRNA gene set analysis utilizing the RbiomirGS23 v0.2.12 R package from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. The RbiomirGS package has been extensively shown in the literature to provide strong pathway prediction that provide strong biological results103–106. From the pathways we chose an FDR < 0.25 cutoff for significantly regulated pathways. We plotted the specific pathways with R package ggplot2.Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) of miRNAs-seq murine data Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the OSDR-334, OSDR-335, OSDR-336, and OSDR-337 miRNA-Seq datasets. First, the miRNA-Seq datasets were merged and outlier samples and genes were removed based on manual inspection using hierarchical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the built-in WGCNA goodSamplesGenes() function. Then Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) was performed using the R Bioconductor package, DESeq2 version 1.38.3. The R Bioconductor package, WGCNA version 1.72-1 was used to perform WGCNA following the standard protocol as detailed in the package vignette.NASA Twin Study data RNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briefly, we will highlight the key methods. The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into 4 mL CPT (Cell Preparation Tube with Sodium HeparinN) tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4 °C until processing (average of 35–37 h after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80 oC. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: 1. plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long term storage at −80 oC. 2. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight samples, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80 oC until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (Qiagen Cat# 1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80 oC until use. Details of transcriptome preparation, sequencing, and analysis were described previously17.NASA Twin Study data miRNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study miRNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Briefly, we will highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB #E7560) per manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modifications: adapters and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEB# E7600, NEB#E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB #E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1x50bp). Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace107. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences108 using the miRDeep2109 quantifier module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p-value < 0.2 was independently performed for each cell type. For flight only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twin Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature components of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family.Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in Overbey et al.19, and Kim et al.110. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. There were two male and two female astronauts for this mission. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. In summary, blood samples were collected before (prelaunch; L-92 days, 44 days, and 3 days) and after (return; R + 1 day, R + 45 days, and R + 82 days) the spaceflight. 21 miRNA target genes suggested in the paper has been used for identifying DEGs from i4 PBMCs and subpopulations. The Seurat method was used to normalize RNA count data and calculate average expression of each gene. We used the average expression of the genes from four astronauts comparing post-flight (R + 1) vs pre-flight (L-92, L-44, and L-3) to identify DEGs with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.05). Average expression of the 21 miRNA target genes was used to generate heatmap plotted by the pheatmap R package. Figure 6f was created with BioRender.com. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). These biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. A 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differential expression analysis. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53018. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were made for the 21 genes key genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (2.6MB, pdf) Peer Review File (582.9KB, pdf) 41467_2024_48920_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (8.8KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Information Supplemental Data 1 (4.6MB, xlsx) Supplemental Data 2 (2MB, xlsx) Supplemental Data 3 (603.4KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3.8MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank Diogo de Moraes for curating the senescence cell markers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations. Subject terms: Ethics, Medical research",
    "introduction": "Introduction It has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the first crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201, a new era of public-private spaceflight partnership has emerged. Private companies such as Boeing, Virgin Galactic, Axiom, Sierra Space, and Blue Origin now create a steep commercial demand for crewed spaceflight, both for technological and recreational purposes. NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world’s first commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial spaceflights, ranging from suborbital flights lasting mere minutes to Axiom’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the first all-civilian orbital commercial spaceflight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4’ (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3. Historically, government-sponsored spaceflights were mission-based and geared towards national interests, e.g., technological leadership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, or advancements in research. After the Cold War era and the “Space Race,” government investment in space exploration declined. In contrast, the idea of commercial spaceflight continues to gain significant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enormous. This has been accompanied by an influx of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable Launch Vehicle models by SpaceX4. Despite this rapid technology development, governmental regulation of commercial spaceflight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial spaceflight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety, payload, payload re-entry, financial stability, and coverage for maximum probable loss5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsored astronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating to space activities from 42 countries6. While the regulations listed there cover a wide range of fields, such as objects in space, radiocommunication, and space activities, there is a general lack of health-associated regulations. This is a symptom of a bigger problem where there is little oversight of private sector spaceflight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon7, and the upcoming Polaris program8, are already a reality. An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with a more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical standards and improve treatment choices for prolonged spaceflight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At the same time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronauts to private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existing medical conditions, there is a need to refine selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite their importance and urgency, these considerations have gone relatively unexplored9. In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues related to space exploration – both commercial and otherwise10–19– our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human subject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might be covered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish the ethical considerations we discuss. A good example illustrating this point is NASA’s recent decision to unify the effective radiation exposure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv, which translates to having to remain below 3% mean risk of cancer mortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences in male and female radiation-based cancer risk20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically problematic. Likewise, signing a consent form to undertake a certain activity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make the proposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from the increase in private and commercial spaceflight arise despite established rules and guidelines22,23. A note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as ‘crew’. This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24 that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crew than ‘ordinary’ spaceflight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term ‘spaceflight occupants’ (SOs), using it to refer to non-professional space travelers lacking substantial spaceflight training. Further, we use the terms ‘laws’ and ‘regulations’ to refer to binding law and the neutral terms ‘guidelines’, ‘recommendations’, and ‘policy’ to refer to non-binding guiding instruments.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science fiction. Commercial/private and civilian spaceflights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be implemented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166968 PMID: 38862473 Abstract Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations. Subject terms: Ethics, Medical research New and dynamically changing opportunities for commercial/private and civilian spaceflight raise the need for an examination of how to ethically guide space industry and community. This Perspective explores such considerations with respect to space traveler selection and human subject research.Introduction It has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the first crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201, a new era of public-private spaceflight partnership has emerged. Private companies such as Boeing, Virgin Galactic, Axiom, Sierra Space, and Blue Origin now create a steep commercial demand for crewed spaceflight, both for technological and recreational purposes. NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world’s first commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial spaceflights, ranging from suborbital flights lasting mere minutes to Axiom’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the first all-civilian orbital commercial spaceflight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4’ (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3. Historically, government-sponsored spaceflights were mission-based and geared towards national interests, e.g., technological leadership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, or advancements in research. After the Cold War era and the “Space Race,” government investment in space exploration declined. In contrast, the idea of commercial spaceflight continues to gain significant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enormous. This has been accompanied by an influx of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable Launch Vehicle models by SpaceX4. Despite this rapid technology development, governmental regulation of commercial spaceflight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial spaceflight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety, payload, payload re-entry, financial stability, and coverage for maximum probable loss5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsored astronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating to space activities from 42 countries6. While the regulations listed there cover a wide range of fields, such as objects in space, radiocommunication, and space activities, there is a general lack of health-associated regulations. This is a symptom of a bigger problem where there is little oversight of private sector spaceflight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon7, and the upcoming Polaris program8, are already a reality. An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with a more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical standards and improve treatment choices for prolonged spaceflight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At the same time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronauts to private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existing medical conditions, there is a need to refine selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite their importance and urgency, these considerations have gone relatively unexplored9. In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues related to space exploration – both commercial and otherwise10–19– our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human subject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might be covered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish the ethical considerations we discuss. A good example illustrating this point is NASA’s recent decision to unify the effective radiation exposure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv, which translates to having to remain below 3% mean risk of cancer mortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences in male and female radiation-based cancer risk20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically problematic. Likewise, signing a consent form to undertake a certain activity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make the proposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from the increase in private and commercial spaceflight arise despite established rules and guidelines22,23. A note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as ‘crew’. This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24 that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crew than ‘ordinary’ spaceflight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term ‘spaceflight occupants’ (SOs), using it to refer to non-professional space travelers lacking substantial spaceflight training. Further, we use the terms ‘laws’ and ‘regulations’ to refer to binding law and the neutral terms ‘guidelines’, ‘recommendations’, and ‘policy’ to refer to non-binding guiding instruments.Considerations on governmental vs. non-governmental spaceflight Biological hazards of spaceflight The selection of professional astronauts is highly regulated because space travel and habitation are demanding and dangerous. Current space missions to the ISS in Low Earth Orbit and future missions pushing the boundaries of human space exploration towards the Moon and Mars are characterized by exposure to space radiation, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and trapped radiation25, changing gravity fields, acceleration/deceleration phenomena26, isolation, and confinement27 in a hostile and closed environment28 and, finally, the increasingly far distance from Earth (Fig. 1). Exposure to GCR/SPE is potentially the most significant single health hazard for Low Earth Orbit; for deep-space crewed missions beyond the Earth’s protective magnetic field this risk profile increases dramatically28. Recently, NASA increased an individual astronaut’s total career effective radiation dose (independent of age at exposure and sex) due to spaceflight radiation exposure to less than 600 mSv, translating into a mean risk increase of cancer mortality (REID) of below 3% above the non-exposed baseline mean21. This change was implemented following a study carried out under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences29. However, these standards remain controversial, especially in light of predicted REID ranging between 6-10% for females exposed at ages 20, 40, and 60 years for a simulated Mars Mission20. Of note, most international partners use a higher career dose limit of 1,000mSV (independent of sex and age). Fig. 1. The Five Hazards in Space Contributing to Increased Health Risks. Open in a new tab The figure exemplifies the main space flight hazards as used by NASA for the Human Research Road Map, such as distance, confinement, hostile and closed environments, galactic cosmic rays and space radiation, and changing gravity fields.Health concerns and ethical considerations regarding commercial space travel are of great importance considering that the aforementioned potential hazards can severely interfere with many physiological processes, such as physiological homeostasis on a cellular and molecular level (Fig. 2), leading to microbiome shifts30,31, inducing dysregulated mitochondrial function32, and causing oxidative stress33. Furthermore, several space hazards cause DNA damage28,30, affect telomere length30, induce significant differences in DNA methylation, and alter accessibility of chromatin regions and specific DNA epitopes30,34. Such cellular and molecular effects lead to serious pathophysiology and health consequences25, including but not limited to: changes in the cardiovascular system including fluid shifts, orthostatic intolerance, reduced ventricle size, thrombus formation28,35–39, musculoskeletal defects defined as muscle atrophy and bone loss30,40–42, central nervous system alterations including fluid shifts, neurocognitive and psychiatric alteration and Space-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)43,44, immune system dysfunction, initiation of malignant processes45 due to loss of DNA integrity, failed DNA repair mechanisms, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements46. Nevertheless, while knowledge mounts, there remains a lack of data addressing individual differences among astronauts, such as age, sex, and genetic background, contributing to the challenges of accurately predicting radiation hazards and outcomes28. Fig. 2. Biological and Health Features of Spaceflight. Open in a new tab Space hazards, as outlined in Fig. 1, drive a diverse array of molecular and cellular changes observed during spaceflight, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, alteration in the microbiome composition, epigenetic changes, and telomere length changes. Such features will have the potential to induce pathophysiologic system changes affecting the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, immune functions, musculoskeletal dynamics, the circadian rhythm, and cancer risk in SOs.Ethical issues related to the dangers and selection of SOs Given these significant spaceflight hazards, stringent selection criteria are important to protect astronaut and SO health and to help ensure that missions can be completed successfully. For instance, the ISS Multilateral Space Medicine Board provides guidance about travel to the ISS by private individuals47,48 and NASA has significantly strengthened its health-oriented recommendations and guidelines over the last two decades. Similarly, independent organizations such as the Aerospace Medical Association, have issued policies and guidelines taking into consideration not just the physical health of SOs but also their mental health49. There are not only expansive rules and guidelines at the selection and annual re-evaluation stage for astronauts, but also stringent health monitoring before, during, and after spaceflight50. However, with increasing commercial and private spaceflight opportunities, it is no longer just trained and pre-screened astronauts who travel to space. Since existing guidance in its various forms applies mostly to government-sponsored or -employed professional astronauts, the question arises as to who determines whether the potential health risks associated with spaceflight are acceptable or not in the case of SOs. Current guidance on its own is not in a good position to resolve some of the issues that will arise in these new contexts. Both medical and scientific research communities as well as a number of governments have long and carefully deliberated about medical and ethical scenarios and questions that might arise during spaceflight. However, while some of their guidelines might apply to certain instances of, say, paying SOs (for example, private astronauts travelling to the ISS and therefore covered by ISS rules), there is still a relative dearth of discussion concerning how to extend these important deliberations to the new types of SO that we are likely to see in the coming decades. Moreover, since existing law and policy frameworks were designed mostly with government-employed or -sponsored astronauts in mind, their scope does not always extend neatly to their non-governmental counterparts. For instance, federal space agencies form an employer-employee relationship with their astronauts. While this might be applicable to some kinds of potential commercial SOs, it will not be applicable to private SOs. For example, while the International Commission on Radiological Protection stresses the importance of radiological protection, in the U.S. the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)51 explicitly states that its purview is “NASA selection of astronauts for participation in space missions” and that “the measures suggested in this Report may be unique to NASA and not generalizable”. Although the refinements proposed by the NCRP to NASA’s shared decision-making framework do not directly pertain to commercial and private SOs, their relevance is evident and should be taken into consideration. One might think that general documents of medical research ethics could provide some help here. For example, the World Medical Association’s (WMA) “Declaration of Helsinki” (DoH)52 is one of the most influential and important sets of ethical principles concerning medical research involving human subjects. While the WMA has no formal authority or binding status, it is still often expected that guidelines concerning research ethics will look to the DoH as a guiding document. However, the DoH is neither accepted by all countries nor uncontroversial. For example, Schüklenk and Ashcroft53 have highlighted both the “absence of a consensus over the actual content of the Declaration and its status”, and stressed its “continuing lack of a serious consultation with the relevant stakeholders”, while also emphasizing the more general “absence of a consensus among knowledgeable, well-intentioned bioethicists, scientists and political activists over the central issue of research ethics standards”. There is also a heated debate about whether there exists an international consensus opinion that violates and diverges from the DoH’s principles54,55. Macklin has argued that, even with revisions, the DoH “cannot resolve ongoing controversies”, since “it simply does not address other aspects of international research about which people disagree”56. Macklin has further stressed conflicts between the DoH and “official regulations promulgated by a federal agency, with enforcement mechanisms and sanctions for noncompliance” and pointed out that “it is hardly surprising that researchers, ethical review bodies, and governmental agencies do not consider the Declaration of Helsinki to be a necessary adjunct to the “official” Common Rule, which governs most federally funded research in the United States”56. Indeed, the US FDA first rejected the 2000 and later revisions, before eliminating all references to the DoH in 200657. The situation is not dissimilar in many other countries and regions. Documents such as the DoH – regardless of its controversies – are much too general to resolve particular ethical conundrums related to human space travel. Thus, while they might provide some necessary restrictions and sometimes even positive guidance, the question of how such general principles apply to specific and concrete cases, especially when there is little precedent, requires further examination. This of course is just one reason why agencies around the world spend enormous efforts on crafting guidelines and recommendations about the ethics of human subject research in space. But who will do the same for those space travelers to whom these do not apply? The relevant international legal framework, i.e. the five UN Space Treaties, do not specifically address the health of astronauts or other spaceflight participants6. The Outer Space Treaty (OST) of 1967 introduces the concept of “envoys of mankind” for astronauts58; the Rescue and Return Agreement (RRA) extends this protection to “personnel of spacecraft”. However, neither of these terms is clearly defined and terminological inconsistencies have led to a broad interpretation, suggesting that the Agreement extends to human life in outer space or spaceflight generally, covering both professional and non-professional space travelers, including tourists. However, these agreements were drafted at a time when activities such as space tourism were unforeseen, posing challenges in predicting and regulating health concerns for modern space activities. Thus, these agreements lack explicit health regulations for individuals that are part of the private space industry and, even if such regulations existed, enforcing them would be challenging due to the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms in international law. To address issues such as these at the US-level, the FAA59 and NASA entered a Memorandum of Understanding in June 2012, to coordinate standards for commercial government or non-government astronaut transport to and from Low Earth Orbit and the ISS. The goal was to foster both public and crew safety, avoid conflicting rules and guidelines, as well as to provide a framework for the American space industry. Despite this, the clearance of ‘ordinary’ SOs for spaceflight is currently the responsibility of commercial providers, with limited oversight, and a lack of standardized screening procedures and protocols60. The US is currently the main country providing such guidance in the form of the FAA Recommended Practices for Human Space Flight Occupant Safety. However, due to the limits of FAA jurisdiction, these guidelines only apply to launch and reentry61. Further, the FAA guidance comes not in the form of mandatory requirements but rather as (minimal) recommendations, suggesting merely that “[p]roximate to flight, the operator should require each space flight participant to consult with a physician, trained or experienced in aerospace medicine, to ascertain their personal medical risks from the space flight profile and vehicle” (2023: B. 4.4.2). It also explicitly states that “[t]his document does not include any specific medical criteria that would limit who should fly in space as a space flight participant.” (2023: A. 6.1). Thus, given that medical consultation is only a recommendation, in principle anyone capable of giving written informed consent can fly, regardless of their health profile, as long as they meet specified spaceflight operator criteria (Fig. 3). This raises a number of issues. Fig. 3. Differential Approaches to Selecting SOs. Open in a new tab Stringent selection criteria (green) for government-sponsored astronauts (i.e., NASA, ESA, JAXA), including a hard stop mechanism are depicted on the right of the schematic (right dashed red line). Less defined commercial space traveler criteria for civilians (red) finally leading to rejection (left dashed red line) are indicated. The green-red color-coded middle area symbolizes the health-related risks, where the array of potential commercial space selection criteria is located.First, if an SO fails to be cleared by one physician, can they get clearance from a more lenient provider elsewhere?62 As Langston points out, “[m]edical forum shopping is a foreseeable ethical and legal concern where regulatory standardization is lacking or is inconsistent between jurisdictions… [which] could lead to increased risk of harm for the individual (in-flight/post-flight), spaceflight and crew, as well as uninvolved third parties”63. This scenario parallels a situation seen in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration64, where a disqualified driver can apply for a resolution if a disagreement exists in regard to the medical qualification exam. However, to oversee potential medical forum shopping, all results from medical examinations have to be entered into the centralized National Registry, preventing the continued medical examination until a desired result is achieved and certified. Second, there might be tension between the potential clearance requirements desirable for a commercial spaceflight operator or provider – who might have an interest in lenient requirements to sell as many seats as possible to the limited pool of individuals who can afford them – and those desirable from the health standpoint of a particular SO. One might argue that SOs should undergo relevant medical consultations and decide on the risks they are willing to take, similar to making choices about risky adventures on Earth. So why should they not be in a position to make similar decisions for space? Nonetheless, while legal and social norms allow people to engage in some risks, the same norms do not give blanket allowance for people to do anything they want, instead exercising various degrees of paternalistic oversight both in people’s private and public lives (for an overview of paternalism and its issues, see Dworkin 2020)65. For example, many governments require drivers and passengers to wear seatbelts, they require motorcyclists to wear helmets, forbid the sale of certain drugs, they forbid people to enter into certain kinds of contracts (for selling organs, gambling debts, etc.). Questions thus arise about the appropriate degree of paternalistic oversight for space travel, as well as questions about who has the power to enforce relevant policies and regulations. A further complication – and again one that speaks in favor of increased guidance or regulation – is that compromised SO health might also affect fellow passengers. In fact, the September 2023 revisions of the FAA recommendations now recognize this problem at least partially, stating that “[m]edical consultation for space flight participants is recommended … to help prevent them from endangering other occupants …. [and] commercial operators will be challenged to control hazards to space flight participants from other space flight participants with medical conditions.”61 This is, of course, also a problem with respect to various forms of ground and air transportation; however, it is exacerbated in the case of space travel. For one, providing assistance in space is more difficult than on the ground or in the air, thus putting fellow travelers in a position in which they are more likely to compromise their own safety during the course of providing help, especially in the absence of mandatory training. Further, space travel has inherent limits about the amount and kind of medical equipment that can be transported and effectively used in a spaceflight environment. Third, even if stringent screening requirements are in place, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the various health consequences of space travel, making it virtually impossible for specific individuals to understand what their actual health risks are, even if advised by someone “trained or experienced in aerospace medicine”61. Current data insufficiently address individual differences among astronauts such as age, sex, and genetic background66, which translates into significant uncertainty in predicting individualized space radiation hazards and outcomes for both astronauts and SOs67. In addition, while it is known that individuals metabolize drugs and supplements differently in space68–70, little to nothing is known about the physiology underlying these changes. Limited available data70 suggests that even relatively common prescription drugs might work differently in space. Furthermore, the reduced and often unknown stability of pharmacologic ingredients and supplements over the course of exploration-rated space missions becomes even more critical70. Specially prepared space medications, appropriate repackaging to improve pharmaceutical stability, and more insight into individual pharmacokinetics are needed to supply both astronauts and SOs with effective pharmaceuticals and/or other treatment options. All of these considerations strongly suggest that some guidance and/or oversight with respect to potential SO screening and clearance would be highly beneficial (Fig. 3). In fact, this is not just so for the SOs, but also for the commercial providers who agree to transport them. While SOs are currently required to sign liability waivers, the legal status of these waivers is unclear, and so binding rules might also provide a way for providers to indemnify themselves against future lawsuits71. However, such rules should be sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors: there is a difference between a private citizen enjoying a suborbital flight and a commercial crew member spending prolonged time in space for research purposes, perhaps on a commercial space station.Human subject research As our technical and research abilities evolve, so do the ethical considerations for using human subjects for research. While NASA estimated the chance of survival of the first mission to the Moon (Apollo 8) at 50-50, such odds for harm would not be accepted for any present-day study involving human subjects (recollection quoted from Ref. 72). NASA’s ethical principles are defined to ensure human research subject welfare and minimize health risks. Further, research protocols can be implemented only if a risk/benefit analysis demonstrates that the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits and the expected importance of new knowledge. This will become even more important for missions to Mars73. In addition to the prevention of direct harm, other important considerations include protecting privacy, ensuring strict data security, and maximizing the positive social impacts of research. Human Subject Research projects in space, supported or otherwise subject to regulation by any US federal department or agency, are strictly regulated under the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR pt 123069). Based on this, the implementation, procedures, and requirements to conduct space-related research involving human subjects is tightly controlled within a binding framework. NASA Institutional Review Board (IRB) committees review such research proposals to guarantee enforcement of these policies and the ethical, safe, and equitable treatment of human research subjects. In addition, the Office of Research Assurance ensures that all activities comply with applicable federal regulations and guidelines, ensuring that human subject welfare and minimal health risk are prioritized for all decisions. Such analysis will not take into account potential long-term effects on public policies. An interesting variation from non-NASA research protocols is the requirement that the responsible flight surgeon maintains the duty to intervene and terminate ongoing research if the health and welfare of astronaut research subjects is in question. While the NASA IRB process adheres to standard practices for IRBs, it has unique aspects focused on human subjects’ well-being beyond typical standards. The highest level of concern involves human subject research studies involving genetic testing. NASA defines genetic testing based on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act74. Studies involving genetic testing in human subjects are deemed of the highest concern and automatically categorized as “greater than minimal risk”, according to NASA75. These studies require additional measures to protect the research subjects, including policies that prohibit the public release of genetic data without prior approval from the individual or their direct family members, in accordance with NASA policy. NASA enforces strict rules as genetic data must be stored separately, and cross-referencing is forbidden without IRB approval. After genetic testing, all electronic data is deleted and given solely to NASA. However, commercial institutions or providers using services at NASA facilities to launch a space vehicle do not have to adhere to such rules in the same way. While the above-described scenarios are focused on NASA, the processes for international ISS partner research are not demonstrating significant national differences. In general, plans for research involving human research subjects are carefully examined by the ethics committee of the researcher’s university or institute, the space agency proposing the research, and the space agency of the astronaut subject. Furthermore, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB), comprising the representatives of space agencies involved in the ISS (NASA, ESA, CSA, JAXA), is tasked with investigating and reviewing ethical matters on the ISS. For all research conducted on an astronaut, the HRMRB looks at whether the safety and health of the astronaut are assured and whether the appropriate ethical considerations have been made. As necessary, the HRMRB then issues recommendations or modification requests. While government-sponsored human subject research is strictly regulated, it is still unclear whether future commercial SOs will be covered under such regulations, or if adherence to government regulations needs to be amended to reflect the new reality of space human subject research.Ethical considerations To date, our knowledge regarding the effects of spaceflight on humans, as well as the efficacy and safety of select medical interventions and pharmaceuticals in space, comes from government-sponsored missions, a small number of astronauts, and, more recently, civilians (Inspiration4, MS-20, Axiom-1)76,77. Increasing this type of knowledge is vital to ensuring the safety of future astronauts and SOs, especially considering the limited opportunities for medical treatment in space. It is therefore likely that astronauts and SOs will need to monitor, diagnose, and treat themselves at least part of the time. Increased commercial and private spaceflight opportunities will bring with them an expanding diversity of SOs with different health profiles, most of them likely not in the same physical and psychological shape as highly trained career astronauts78–80. By necessity, increasing knowledge about the effects of the spaceflight environment on human molecular biology, physiology, and psychology, as well as on the chemical composition of pharmaceuticals, involves human subject research. With the success of the recent Inspiration4 mission in defining a wide range of biomedical data, the role of commercial and private SOs in such research is likely to increase. As previously outlined, government-sponsored spaceflights adhere to stringent criteria with respect to human subject research, through their respective IRBs, ethics committees, and groups. In the case of Inspiration4, research was conducted through Weill Cornell Medicine, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health of the Baylor College of Medicine81, California Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and underwent similarly rigorous approval processes82. As the general standard for human subject research requires compliance with ethics approvals, it is expected that commercial spaceflight-based human subject research will continue to follow these and other applicable internationally ratified processes (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Human Subject Research Ethical and Operational Guidelines. Open in a new tab A schematic for the ethical framework for space human subject research. This framework defines the key existing principles and regulations that currently exist in human research (in blue), the implementation of these ethical standards in the clinic and research laboratory (in yellow), and the challenges that should be considered and will arise for human research in space (in orange).However, commercial spaceflight also raises new ethical issues. In the past, human subject research in space was mostly a secondary concern of overall missions whereas now missions are increasingly conducted explicitly for this purpose. Ethical recruitment for biomedical research requires informed consent. For space travel, this requires participants to have a good understanding of the space environment, the nature of associated environmental hazards, as well as the potential side effects of any drugs under study51. But to what extent is such consent really possible with respect to space travel?83 Exposure to high radiation, microgravity, and galactic rays may compromise participant safety in a number of unknown ways. Further, the effect of radiation and other extra-terrestrial factors on the chemical composition of pharmaceutical ingredients is largely unknown, thus making it especially difficult to inform potential subjects about likely side effects. The US Code of Regulations for informed consent requires a “description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject” (Title 45, A.A. Part 46.116, b282). In the case of space travel, where many or most risks are unknown, it is unclear to what extent – if at all – this requirement can be met. Thus, there is a need to incorporate new and emerging ethical issues into existing frameworks in ways that are based on the same underlying ethical principles that gave rise to these and similar regulations in the first place and that are applicable to space travel. This is all the more urgent since civilians are already involved in such research51. Note also that the aforementioned problems are exacerbated for non-astronaut SOs: most of the existing data is not from a random population, but rather from an elite force markedly dissimilar to average citizens in terms of training, age, health, and biomedical and behavioral profiles. Additionally, it has been established that even highly trained individuals respond quite differently to the zero-gravity environment84. Moreover, existing research was conducted on a population with a high degree of sex, gender, and ethnic homogeneity and relatively low diversity. Currently, it is therefore unclear to what extent this research generalizes to SOs beyond the relatively narrow population that has been studied so far. Furthermore, principles of health ethics encompass avoiding harm, beneficence, achieving a favorable risk-benefit balance, respecting autonomy, fairness, and fidelity85. Terrestrial clinical trials rely on large participant numbers, secure drug storage, and timely sample collection, which are difficult to replicate in space. How to ensure compliance with these principles in space thus remains uncertain. There are also some concerns about individual principles: For example, human subject research in space may violate a participant’s autonomy, should the individual decide to withdraw from the study. In terrestrial medical research, subjects may at any time withdraw their consent, even if the study is already in progress. Such withdrawal, however, is much more complicated in space. Even if individuals are able to drop out, return to Earth will not be immediate. There is also no way for individuals to withdraw from the possible (unknown) long-term effects of the spaceflight environment, and any consent thus involves not just consent to the study itself, but consent to any future effects that might result from spaceflight activities. This might also lead to violating the Avoiding Harm principle, since remaining in space is unhealthy for participants, especially if the desired withdrawal occurs as the result of unforeseen health problems. In turn, these conditions might then violate the Favorable Risk and Benefit Balance, due to the changing circumstances during the course of research. In NASA’s case, the responsible flight surgeon can interrupt trials. However, in the absence of official, government-sanctioned flight surgeons with extensive spaceflight experience, who assumes the equivalent responsibilities for SO healthcare, ensuring subjects’ best interests are met? These problems represent only a small subset of issues, demonstrating the urgent need for guidance on non-government space research on human subjects (for further issues relating to privacy and behavioral health, see86,87). Such research should follow strict ethics committee review and otherwise meet the same stringent standards that NASA, ESA, and JAXA currently adhere to88, including following suggestions by international medical research bodies, such as the DoH, The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences’ International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans89, and others.Conclusion We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science fiction. Commercial/private and civilian spaceflights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just a possibility but a reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be implemented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards.Acknowledgements We thank Diana Lim for the preparation of the figures, critical comments, and consultation regarding the effective display of the images.

    "abstract": "Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

    "introduction": "Introduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5 changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to S. marcescens using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.",

    "results": "Results Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. 1). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 (P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 (P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table 1. Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”).

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth of spaceflight S. marcescens in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 (F = 0.9113, P = 0.489), 6 (F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 (F = 1.169, P = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.006) (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1). Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig. 1), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 (P = 0.995) or Ground 2 (P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 (P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 (P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig. 2a). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2. These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours 0 (F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 (F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 (F = 0.443, P = 0.731) or 15 (F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13 Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens. Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of S. marcescens. Open in a new tab a Graph showing survival of w1118 flies after injection with LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control-treated or sham-treated Db11 samples, and b Graph showing in vivo growth of LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control or sham-treated Db11 after injection into w1118 flies. Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F = 3.551, P = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection (F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12 (F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 (F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points. Infection of Immune Deficiency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd mutant flies (PGRP-LCΔ5, imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a, since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marcescens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll deficient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 4c). Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig. 4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables 2–6. Fig. 4. Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown S. marcescens. Open in a new tab Survival curves of Imd pathway mutant flies, a and b, and of Toll pathway mutant flies, c and d, after exposure to either Ground 1 bacteria, a and c, or Space 1 bacteria, b and d. All graphs have data from two wild-type flies (y1w* and w1118) for reference. e Volcano plot of the RNA-seq data from ground-reared wild-type D. melanogaster that were infected with space bacteria relative to ground bacteria. RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The x-axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10q value, a p-value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with q-value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed. f PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions. RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of S. marcescens. These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 1). At the significance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2, is a translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.",

Copyright notice ID: 7000411 PMID: 32047838 Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized. Subject terms: Infection, Innate immunity, MicrobiologyIntroduction As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5 changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7 and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of spaceflight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a promising model for understanding the effects of spaceflight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience a dramatic shift in immune gene expression following spaceflight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack a characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with a functional homolog in the fruit fly.25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, S. marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. D. melanogaster has been recently used as a model for studying S. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38 Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes to S. marcescens using a model system. Studies in true spaceflight conditions are difficult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and mass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of spaceflight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true spaceflight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space-flown or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect D. melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type flies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space-flown and ground-based microgravity simulations (e.g., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on D. melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space-flown and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that spaceflight induces a physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the D. melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground.Results Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. 1). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 (P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 (P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table 1. Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”).

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2In vivo growth of spaceflight S. marcescens in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 (F = 0.9113, P = 0.489), 6 (F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 (F = 1.169, P = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.0002) and Space 2 (P = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground (P = 0.006) (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1).Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig. 1), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 (P = 0.995) or Ground 2 (P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 (P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 (P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig. 2a). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2. These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours 0 (F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 (F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 (F = 0.443, P = 0.731) or 15 (F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a).Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13 Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens. Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of S. marcescens. Open in a new tab a Graph showing survival of w1118 flies after injection with LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control-treated or sham-treated Db11 samples, and b Graph showing in vivo growth of LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control or sham-treated Db11 after injection into w1118 flies. Error bars represent one standard error.In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F = 3.551, P = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection (F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12 (F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 (F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points.Infection of Immune Deficiency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd mutant flies (PGRP-LCΔ5, imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a, since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marcescens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll deficient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 4c). Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig. 4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables 2–6. Fig. 4. Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown S. marcescens. Open in a new tab Survival curves of Imd pathway mutant flies, a and b, and of Toll pathway mutant flies, c and d, after exposure to either Ground 1 bacteria, a and c, or Space 1 bacteria, b and d. All graphs have data from two wild-type flies (y1w* and w1118) for reference. e Volcano plot of the RNA-seq data from ground-reared wild-type D. melanogaster that were infected with space bacteria relative to ground bacteria. RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The x-axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10q value, a p-value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with q-value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed. f PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions.RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of S. marcescens. These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 1). At the significance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2, is a translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host.Discussion In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48–50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 1). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.Materials and methods D. melanogaster fly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24 °C). All fly lines were obtained from Bloomington Stock center including w1118 (#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376), relE20 (no. 55714), y1w* (no. 55707), dif1 (no. 36559), imd1 (no. 55711), PGRP-LCΔ5 (#36323), and PGRP-SAseml (#55716).Bacterial growth conditions during spaceflight The hardware used in this study was the FIT (Fly Immunity and Tumors) cassette and changeout platform, as described in our previous Drosophila experiments on the ISS.23,66 Food trays were prepared using the methods described below, and stored in a cargo transfer bag (CTB) at 4 °C for launch. Towards the end of the 30 day spaceflight (Fruit Fly Lab – 01 on SpaceX-CRS 5 mission), the food trays containing S. marcescens were retrieved from 4 °C storage and placed within the FIT food changeout platform. The platform was placed in a canvas CTB at ISS ambient temperature (23–25 °C) for 5 days, plus 2 days in the SpaceX Dragon (22–25 °C) for undocking/descent and retrieval. During the growth period, environmental data (CO2, O2, temperature, and relative humidity) was recorded and used to match the growth conditions for ground control experiments.Preparation of S. marcescens Db11 for spaceflight Serratia marcescens Db11 was obtained from the University of Minnesota C. elegans stock center. To prepare for the spaceflight experiment, the Db11 strain was grown for 20 h in liquid LB broth with 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.100 in PBS. Next, 100 µL of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing 2 mL of solid semi-defined fly food media containing 4% Brewer’s yeast (Redstar), 6% glucose, 3% sucrose, 2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% agar, 0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.05% calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma), 0.5% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), 0.001% p-hydroxybenzoate, and 0.6% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These two trays were the source of the Space 1 and Space 2 samples that were used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays (Ground 1 and Ground 2) from the same source sample. These two trays were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator (Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas composition, temperature, and humidity profiles measured during the flight. After preparing the bacterial sample trays for flight, they were placed into plastic bags and stored at 4 °C, then sent to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-5. Control trays were stored on the ground at 4 °C. Growth conditions on the ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the spaceflight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and stored frozen at −80 °C. Similar isolation was performed in parallel for the ground samples. The placement of the bacterial cultures on semi-defined fly food media allowed for inflight infection of flies, as flies would ingest the bacteria that was growing on the media. However, due to logistical constraints during flight, in-flight infection was not possible and the bacterial cultures were grown in space and harvested after return for treatment of flies on the ground after flight as described in the following sections.Injection of spaceflight S. marcescens Db11 samples into D. melanogaster Injections of bacteria were performed according to methods described previously by our group and others.23,67 Concentrations of spaceflight and ground samples stored in 50% glycerol at −80 °C were determined by performing colony counts on LB plates. These samples were then diluted in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. Sterile 12.5% glycerol in sterile PBS was used as a sham injection control. For survival experiments and in vivo growth assays for both spaceflight bacteria and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting (Figs 1–4). Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was ~10 CFU/fly. Control, ground, or spaceflight samples were then injected into anesthetized 2–3 day-old female (post-eclosion) D. melanogaster in the ventrolateral abdomen. Injections of immune mutant flies were done using a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin, New Hampshire). Injection bolus was calibrated to 600 nm diameter, which equaled approximately 10 CFU/fly. Injections of each treatment group took <1 h, with the survival measurements beginning at the end of that first hour. After injections, flies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. Survival curves were measured by performing three independent experiments using a minimum of N = 50 flies in each experiment, then pooling the data from all three experiments for the Cox Proportional Hazard survival analysis, which measures the magnitude of difference in survival between different treatment groups. In vivo bacterial load was assayed in the fly at 0, 9, 12, and 15 h post-injection. Bacterial load was assayed immediately following injection by placing three flies in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). This homogenization procedure was repeated for each condition tested. Next, 100 µL of this sample was then spread/plated onto an LB agar plate. To assay subsequent time-points, three flies were placed in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized as above. This sample was then serially diluted, 20 µL into 180 µL of PBS until a dilution of 105 was obtained. Next, 40 µL from each dilution from 100 to 105 was then spot plated onto an LB agar plate and allowed to dry. All plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight before counting. Each in vivo bacterial load experiment was independently repeated three times and each experiment included three replicate samples per time point for all experiments. Error bars were calculated to represent one standard error. Due to limited bacterial sample availability from the spaceflight mission and the time required to inject 50 or more individual flies per condition per experiment, not all samples (Space 1 and 2, Ground 1 and 2) were included in every experiment. After initial experiments had verified the consistency of the virulence data from Space 1 and Space 2 samples relative to the Ground 1 and Ground 2 samples, only one sample from each spaceflight and ground condition was chosen in subsequent studies.Ground subcultures of spaceflight sample Injections to test the virulence of space-flown bacteria were performed as noted above where the spaceflight and ground bacteria were diluted in PBS from frozen glycerol stocks and directly injected into the fly host. However to test whether the space-flown bacteria would retain their increased virulence after growing under ground conditions for several generations, bacterial cultures were first allowed to grow for 24 h (~23 generations of growth) on the ground before injecting into Drosophila hosts. A sterile inoculation loop was used to transfer a small amount of glycerol stocks into liquid LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin, then grown for 24 h in a 37 °C incubator with a shaker set to 225 rpm. These samples were then diluted in PBS down to ~4 × 103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections, and injections were performed as described above.Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in the RWV Cultures of Db11 were grown from non-spaceflight lab stocks of Db11 frozen at −80 °C in Copan Cryovials, onto agar plates with streptomycin (LB + 100 µg/mL) for 18–24 h and then stored at 4 °C for at most 2 weeks. Liquid subcultures were created using a single colony from these agar plates and grown in conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 25 rpm for 24 h. These liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media before being further diluted 1:1000 in LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin and placed into a sterile disposable 10 mL RWV (Synthecon). Air bubbles were removed from the RWV and sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either horizontal (simulated microgravity or LSMMG) or vertical (normal gravity, NG) axis at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.11) Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached.Injection of RWV samples into D. melanogaster Injections were performed as noted above with the following alterations. Stationary phase cultures from RWV were diluted down to an A600 of 0.100 in PBS and then further diluted down 1/100 fold to an end concentration of ~8 × 103 CFU/mL in PBS. Approximately 65 nL of sterile PBS, LSMMG, or NG cultures were then injected into 2–3-day old flies as noted above. Survival and bacterial load were both monitored as previously stated.RNA extraction and sequencing from infected fly host In order to see whether there was any difference in host immunity after infection with Space or Ground bacteria, RNA was extracted in triplicate from two live ground-reared adult flies for each treatment (space or ground sample injection) approximately 18 h after infection using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74104) with β-mercaptoethanol (10 µL/mL) in the lysis buffer. Lysis was performed by placing the flies in a 1.5 mL tube containing 600 µL of the lysis buffer, which were then homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). The entire homogenate was then placed in the manufacturer-supplied spin column, where an on-column DNase digestion step was performed as per manufacturer recommendation). An additional purification step was added using additional wash steps with the kit buffers. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 100 bp reads and paired-end library prep. Transcript abundance estimates from the raw sequenced reads were made using kallisto (version 0.42.4)68 and the D. melanogaster reference transcriptome (build r6.13). Differential expression analysis between Space and Ground bacteria infection conditions was performed using sleuth (version 0.30.0) Wald test.69 Transcripts with q-values < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 13 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and in Excel (version 15.4). For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards model was used, with the exception of the Toll and Imd mutant injections, for which a Log-rank Mantel-Cox analysis was performed to compare curves across treatments. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. For in vivo growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in combination with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis. For all statistical analyses with the exception of the first subculture growth and survival, only results with a statistical significance < 0.05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables.Ethics statement We use the invertebrate model system Drosophila melanogaster for this study, in accordance, the study was exempt from ethics committee approval.Supplementary information Supplementary material (91.6KB, pdf) nr-reporting-summary (1.3MB, pdf) Acknowledgements We would like to thank Matthew Lera (M.L.), Amy Gresser (A.G.) and Kevin Martin (K.M.) for spaceflight project support; and NASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research Program (SLPSRA) for the following grants to S.B.: NNX13AN38G and NNX15AB42G.Author contributions R.G. is the primary author of this paper, and performed many of the reported experiments reported in this paper along with M.T. and analyzed all of the data reported.

Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.Graphical Abstract In Brief Walls et al. find that exposure to microgravity aboard the ISS causes heart dysfunction in a fly cardiac model. Hearts are less contractile and exhibit changes in genes and proteins that maintain heart structure and function. Effects are seen in several lines of flies, suggesting a common response to microgravity.INTRODUCTION Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac health has been a major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only a few weeks to a few months failed to uncover any cardiac effects (Hamilton et al., 2011), and some studies suggested that changes in function could be explained by dehydration (Summers et al., 2005). However, the number of subjects examined in those studies was low, with sometimes conflicting results, and they were without discernable (cardiac) health risks, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. Experiments designed to mimic longer-term exposure to microgravity (bed rest in humans and hind limb unloading in mice) showed reductions in cardiac contractility (Platts et al., 2009) and increases in arrhythmia (Respress et al., 2014). Increases in ventricular contraction (QT) intervals have also been reported in astronauts after longer-duration flights (D’Aunno et al., 2003), suggesting reductions in the cardiac repolarization reserve (Akoum et al., 2011), but those conclusions are again based on few subjects with differing genetic backgrounds. Dysfunction in several cardiac ion channels are known to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene, also known to code for the hERG channel, is one of the ion channels that contribute to LQTS. hERG channel dysfunction can be caused by alterations in the genes encoding this channel as well as by some commonly used medications (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006). To systematically explore the effects of spaceflight on the heart, we used the Drosophila cardiac model to examine how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects cardiac health. We report the effects of microgravity on heart function in wild-type (WT) fruit flies (Drosophila Canton-S [CS]) that were born, developed, and spent 1–3 weeks as adults aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared with their ground-based controls (Figure 1A). We also examined the effects of microgravity on flies with mutations in seizure (sei), the fly homolog of the human hERG gene. Our results show that structural and functional cardiac remodeling occurs in response to microgravity and that remodeling is more severe in the channel mutants. Cardiac RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of WT and sei/hERG mutant flies and follow-up immunohistochemistry studies suggest that alterations in proteostasis likely contribute to the observed changes in cardiac function in microgravity. Figure 1. Heart Size and Contractility Are Reduced under Microgravity. Open in a new tab (A) Drosophila flies were reared aboard the ISS in a customized Nanoracks vented fly box (VFB) containing 15 vials of flies and food (bottom, left). Each vial contained 10 virgin females and 5 males when launched. Vials remained in the VFB for the duration of the microgravity exposure. (B) End-diastolic diameters (EDDs) in hearts from females (red, top) and males (blue, bottom) were significantly decreased in female, but not male, space flown (SF) Canton-S flies compared with ground controls (GCs). EDDs recovered in hearts from female flies born in space but cultured as adults in 1g (space flight recovery [SFR]). EDDs in all sei/hERG mutant flies were reduced relative to Canton-S flies; genetic background controls were not significantly affected by microgravity. (C) End systolic diameters (ESDs) were also reduced in sei/hERG/hERG mutant flies under both gravity conditions relative to Canton-S flies. (D and E) Fractional shortening (D), a measure of contractility, and cardiac output (E) were significantly reduced in hearts from both male and female Canton-S flies under microgravity and showed partial recovery in flies born in space and reared as adults in 1g (SFR). Heart function parameters were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test. p values are shown. Fly numbers are indicated in the bars in (B).RESULTS Lifelong Microgravity Exposure Caused Cardiac Dysfunction and Remodeling We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult Drosophila, each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic; Figure 1A). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1g (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1g (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1g before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]). For cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15–30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high-speed digital cameras (140–160 frames/s [fps]) for subsequent heart-function analysis (Fink et al., 2009; Ocorr et al., 2007). Measurements of heart diameters were made at the widest portion of the second abdominal chamber during systole and diastole. Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) (Figure 1B, top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity (Figure S1A). There was a trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as a small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males (Figures 1B, bottom left, and S1A). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end-systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex (Figure 1C). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD – ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility (Figure 1D). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was a highly significant reduction in cardiac output (Figure 1E). As previously observed (Ocorr et al., 2017), cardiac size and output in sei/hERG mutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1g compared with CS hearts (Figures 1B and 1C). Interestingly, there was a small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from female sei/hERG mutants, which translated into a modest increase in the cardiac output (Figure 1C, top). The length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high-speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1g- and microgravity-exposed flies (Figures S1B and S1C). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show a significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps a response to increased load when returned to 1g. Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia (Figure S1D, bottom; arrhythmia index [AI], a measure of beat-to-beat variability) (Ocorr et al., 2007), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance (Figure S1D, top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia in sei/hERG mutant flies compared with CS controls at 1g, but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity (Figures S1B-S1D). Representative high-speed videos of hearts from both lines reared under 1g and microgravity are provided (Video S1).Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Differential Expression in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and Proteasome Regulatory Genes under Microgravity After filming for cardiac functional analyses, hearts were removed and processed for transcriptomic analysis. Hierarchical-cluster analyses from triplicate samples from CS 1g (CS_G), CS microgravity-exposed (CS_S), sei/hERG 1g (sei_G), and sei/hERG-microgravity-exposed (sei_S) flies were performed. The results showed that triplicates from each genotype and condition clustered within their respective group. Genotypes clustered at shorter distances then those with microgravity exposure. Hearts from WT CS flies reared in microgravity compared with 1g GCs showed upregulation of 250 genes (1.25-fold; adjusted [adj.] p value ≤ 0.05); of which, 86 genes were increased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) (Figure 2B). Ontological analysis of the 250 upregulated genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation bioinformatics microarray analysis showed an ~20-fold enrichment in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent protein catabolism genes, a 23-fold enrichment in chromatin assembly and disassembly genes, and a 12-fold enrichment in genes with endopeptidase activity, among other ontologies (Table 1). Conversely, 618 genes were downregulated (1.25-fold; adj. p value ≤ 0.05); of which, 313 genes were decreased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) (Figure 2B). Here, ontological analysis identified 2-fold or greater enrichment in gene subsets enriched for proteolysis, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and the ECM (Table 1). Figure 2.

Within the 38 commonly upregulated genes, we identified multiple proteasomal/Ub-dependent protein catabolic genes, including ProsAlpha6, Rpn13, Npl4, and CG2046 (Table S1). Within the 189 downregulated genes, there was a 7.9-fold enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic process genes (Table S2; Figure S2). Half of those genes mapped specifically to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway and included key conserved enzymes, such as Agat4, Gpdh1, Gpd2, and Gapdh1 (Figure S2). Among downregulated genes, there was also a 3.2-fold enrichment in genes encoding proteins found in the ECM. In addition, oxidation-reduction and proteolysis genes were enriched in commonly downregulated genes (Table S2; see also Figure S2). Nineteen genes were contra-regulated. Volcano plots (Figure 2C) show the relative distribution of differentially expressed genes in CS and sei/hERG, normalized to their respective GCs. In general, more genes were downregulated than were upregulated under microgravity, with more genes differentially expressed at a higher magnitude in sei compared with CS. Adjusted read-count data for all samples have been provided (Data S1). It should be noted that fruit fly hearts are very small, and the material isolated was insufficient to validate our RNA-seq analyses, which were run in triplicate, with qPCR.Microgravity Exposure Caused Myofibrillar and ECM Remodeling of the Heart We examined the cardiac morphology of GC and microgravity-reared flies in a subset of hearts used for the functional assays. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin (F-actin) revealed the myofibrillar structure within the myocardial cells that make up the heart tube (Figures 3A-3D). In CS GC hearts, the myofibrils are typically tightly packed and circumferentially arranged within those cells (Figure 3A), such that shortening of the sarcomeres results in a squeezing of the heart tube and ejection of the hemolymph present within the heart lumen (Video S1). Hearts from flies exposed to microgravity have myofibrils that are much more loosely arranged, with gaps, and were organized in a more-longitudinal orientation compared with 1g controls (Figures 3A and 3B). Myofibrillar reorganization or remodeling has previously been documented in hearts from sei/hERG mutants (Ocorr et al., 2017) and was again observed in hearts from 1g sei/hERG GCs (Figure 3C). However, hearts from sei/hERG mutants reared in microgravity showed even-more-extensive myofibrillar reorganization and disarray than GCs, and F-actin staining was diminished compared with GCs (Figure 3D). Figure 3. Microgravity Causes Myofibrillar and Fibrotic Remodeling.

(G) Quantification of myocardial-cell-associated collagen IV staining from z stack images. Significance was determined by a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison post hoc test. (H) Heatmap of significantly altered mRNA expression of sarcomere-associated genes (top) and ECM genes (bottom). Data were normalized to the average expression across row for each gene (Z score).To further quantify myofibrillar structure, we calculated relative sarcomere lengths from our F-actin-stained z stack images (Figure S3) by quantifying the number of sarcomeres per 30-μm myofilament length. Sarcomere number was significantly reduced under microgravity for both female and male Canton-S flies (Figure S3), suggesting that hearts from SF flies were capable of generating less force than their GC siblings. Sarcomere counts in Canton-S SFR hearts were not different from GC hearts and, for heart diameters, there were no significant differences among any of the hearts from sei/hERG mutants (Figure S3). In conjunction with the myofibrillar remodeling, we also observed a significant reorganization of the ECM surrounding the heart. In the Drosophila heart, this extracellular network consists primarily of the collagen IV homolog pericardin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that network of collagen IV fibers surrounding the heart (Figure 3), and we show that it partially co-localizes with the z-band protein α-actinin (Figures S4A-S4H). In GC CS flies, those collagen fibers run orthogonally over the myofibrils of myocardial cells (Figures 3A and 3E) to form what appears to be a stabilizing network. Hearts from female CS flies reared in microgravity showed noticeable reductions in that myofiber-associated network (Figures 3B and 3F), consistent with the myofibrillar remodeling. Quantification of the cardiac muscle associated networks showed that this reduction was significant in SF female hearts (Figure 3G), although the decrease seen for CS male flies did not reach significance (Figure 3G). This result was unexpected because cardiomyopathy from compromised heart function is usually accompanied by increased collagen deposition, i.e., fibrosis. This myofibril-associated collagen network in sei/hERG mutant GCs (Figures 3C and 3G) was already significantly reduced compared with that of CS GCs (Figures 3B and 3G), also likely a reflection of the previously observed myofibrillar remodeling in these mutants at 1g (Ocorr et al., 2017). Interestingly, we did observe intra-chamber fibrosis in a large percentage of hearts analyzed from sei mutants on the ground (arrows in Figures 2C″,3C, and 3C′), something we rarely observed in CS flies at 1g or microgravity. At 1g, 60% of sei/hERG versus 1% of CS females and 65% of sei/hERG versus 16% CS males showed evidence of intra-chamber collagen IV localization (p < 0.005, Mann Whitney unpaired t test for both males and females). Unexpectedly, most hearts from SF sei/hERG females exhibited only faint collagen fibers, and there were large globular aggregates of collagen in the cardiac lumen as well as deposits that appeared to fill-in gaps between myofibrils (Figures 3D, 3D′, and 3D″). Hearts from SF sei/hERG males exhibited more-extensive pericardin networks compared with SF sei/hERG females, but those networks were also reduced in microgravity compared with sei/hERG male GCs (Figure 3G). The observed structural and morphological changes (Figures 3A-3D and 3G) correlate with a complex misexpression of various cardiac sarcomeric genes, (Figure 3H, top). Control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of human actin orthologs, including Actin88F (hACTB) and Actin79b (hACTA/B). However, unique to CS, expression of the sarcomeric organizational gene basigin (hBSG), z-band localized metabolic genes GAPDH1 and GPDH, and unconventional myosin jaguar (jar) (hMYO6) were reduced, whereas the later three were upregulated in sei/hERG flies under 1g. Conversely, sarcomeric organizational gene rolling pebbles (rols) (hTANC2) was upregulated in CS in microgravity. Interestingly, reduced expression of a variety of myosin-related genes was observed exclusively in sei/hERG mutants under microgravity, including myosin heavy chain (Mhc) (hMHC7), myosin light chain1 (Mlh1) (hMYL1), Myo10A (hMYO15A), and Tropomyosin 1 (Tm1) (hTPM1). Additionally, the observed changes in ECM content and morphology also correlated with misexpression of collagen/ECM regulatory genes (Figure 3H, bottom). Both control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of procollagen lysyl hydroxylase (plod) (hPLOD1-3) and lysyl oxidase-1 (lox) (hLOXL2). These collagen maturation genes promote collagen cross-linking and ECM formation. However, in SF CS flies, the collagen network degradative gene, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) (hMMP14/24), was also downregulated. In sei/hERG mutants, cardiac MMP1 expression was elevated under both gravity conditions, relative to CS. However, for CS, MMP2 (hMMP15) expression was reduced in microgravity. CS flies exhibited a reduction in multiple collagen-type-IV-encoding genes, including Cg25C (hCOL4A1), viking (vkg) (hCOL4A1), Col4a1(hCOL4A1/2/6), and pericardin (prc), as well as collagen and fibrinogen domain containing CG30280 (hFIBCD1) and CG31832 (hFCN1). Interestingly, most of these genes are upregulated in sei/hERG at 1g compared with CS, as would be expected under pathological cardiac remodeling conditions. Nevertheless, their expression shows a similar reduction under microgravity. The notable exceptions are the elevated CG30282 (see Figure 3H) expression in sei/hERG mutants, which remains high in space. Importantly, this misexpression of cell adhesion genes may underlie the observed misregulation of the pericardin network under microgravity (Figure S5).Proteasome Numbers Are Significantly Increased in Hearts from SF Flies Remarkably, nearly all the genes encoding proteasome subunits were significantly upregulated under microgravity in hearts from CS WT flies (Figure 4A). In contrast, at 1g, proteasome gene expression was already reduced in the hearts from sei/hERG mutants relative to CS. Nevertheless, microgravity exposure also resulted in upregulation of cardiac proteasome genes in sei/hERG mutants relative to their sei/hERG GCs (Figure 4A), albeit to levels that were still reduced relative to CS GCs. Our observation that cardiac proteasome gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to microgravity suggested that protein folding had been compromised and/or degradation was elevated. We had a fortunate and unique opportunity to test that hypothesis on a subsequent mission launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX commercial resupply service (CRS)-11 using the same protocol as for CRS-03. For this study, we generated flies that expressed UAS-polyQ46 GFP only in the myocardial cells using a tinCΔ4-Gal4 driver. This GFP-tagged 46-glutamine repeat polypeptide (PolyQ46) is an intermediate length between disease-causing polyQ repeat lengths and the WT polyQ containing proteins (Melkani et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that treatment with agents that increase reactive oxygen species in the heart increase the number and size of GFP-positive plaques (Melkani et al., 2013) in UAS-polyQ46 GFP-expressing hearts. In this respect, polyQ46 acts as a marker for protein misfolding and aggregation under cardiac proteostatic stress. Figure 4. Proteasome mRNA and Protein Expression Is Decreased in Heart in Microgravity. Open in a new tab (A) Expression of mRNA encoding many proteasome subunits is dramatically increased by exposure to microgravity in hearts from CS SF flies compared with CS GCs. Hearts from sei/hERG mutant GCs have much lower expression of these same subunits, and the expression is not altered by microgravity. Each box is the average of triplicate samples normalized to the overall averaged expression for all hearts. (B and C) Images from a single cardiac chamber in GC (B) and SF (C) CS female flies homozygous for Hand-gal4 > UAS polyQ46 GFP.

(D and E) GFP particle count (D) and total area (E) were increased in hearts from females (red symbols) but not males (blue symbols) under microgravity. (F) Proteasome particle count was significantly higher in females compared with males and was significantly increased in female hearts in response to microgravity. (G) Proteasome aggregate total area was also significantly increased in females but not in males. For all graphs, significance was determined by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005.Immunohistochemical analysis (Figure S6F) of hearts from GC flies exhibited GFP-positive plaques and anti-proteasome puncta (Figure 4C; GC), which were typically found near myocardial cell nuclei. Hearts from microgravity-reared flies had significantly more GFP-positive polyQ plaques (Figure 4D) covering a larger area of the heart (Figure 4E) compared with 1g controls. Proteasome puncta were also more abundant (Figure 4F), covering a larger total area (Figure 4G) of the heart. In addition, in myocardial cells, a significant amount of α-proteasome “haze” was observed, which could represent less-highly aggregated proteasomes (Figure 4C; SF). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the heart in space, proteasomal gene and protein expression is dramatically upregulated, although proteosomes are likely dysfunctional, as manifest by co-localized proteasomal and polyQ aggregates.DISCUSSION As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered g forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractable Drosophila model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been previously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations (2 weeks) (Miller and Keller, 1999). Heart function analysis in our denervated, semi-intact preparations confirmed a cardiac-specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling (Figures 3A-3D), reduced sarcomere count (Figure S3), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes (Figure 3H), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray (Madan et al., 2020; Viswanathan et al., 2014), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin-transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies (Cammarato et al., 2008). We have also shown that mutations in unc-45, a chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart (Melkani et al., 2011). Although a role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell-adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function (Nishimura et al., 2014), thus suggesting a possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well-established roles in the etiology of a variety of cardiac diseases (Marston, 2018). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with transcriptional misexpression of sarcomeric genes, cardiomyocyte myofibrillar disorganization, and ultimately, cardiac contractile dysfunction. Lack of an effect on overall chronotropy, along with an increased incidence of arrhythmia in male flies is consistent with findings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Wnorowski et al., 2019). Under pathological cardiomyopathy conditions, collagen deposition is usually increased leading to fibrosis, which contributes to impaired contractility. Surprisingly, the collagen IV network that normally surrounds and attaches to the cardiomyocytes was decreased under microgravity. Remodeling occurred in both CS and, to a greater extent, in sei/hERG mutant hearts, which also exhibited intra-lumen fibrosis and collagen aggregation. These observations were consistent with misexpression of collagen and ECM maturation and degradative genes, as well as collagen and cell-adhesion-encoding genes. Although fibrosis is generally associated with cardiac disease, ECM degradation is an observed feature in both the volume-overloaded heart and in end-stage diastolic remodeling from pressure overload (Frangogiannis, 2019). ECM degradation is associated with features of contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially due in part to loss of matrix-dependent signals that are required for preservation of function. Additionally, misregulation of ECM composition has also been implicated in cardiac disease. Taken together, ECM remodeling is a potential maladaptive effect of prolonged exposure to microgravity in our model and may be a contributing factor to the observed cardiac dysfunction. Expression of basigin, a transmembrane protein (Suzuki et al., 2016) involved in sarcomeric organization, was significantly downregulated in sei/hERG mutant hearts relative to WT at 1g, but exposure to microgravity resulted in an increased expression in sei/hERG mutants. Basigin has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in pressure overload models and to activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ECM components and thus promote ECM remodeling. This is consistent with the expression of MMP1 maintained in sei/hERG mutants compared with CS and may have a role in the dramatic collagen IV remodeling in SF sei/hERG mutant hearts. This sarcomeric modification may serve to stiffen the heart wall, allowing cardiac output to be maintained in mutants at microgravity, despite the myofibrillar remodeling and overall reduced expression of muscle structural proteins. Interestingly, basigin (CD147) has recently emerged as a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020). Gap junctions are important intercellular connections among cardiomyocytes, allowing the organ to work as a syncytium. They are composed of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in flies. Innexin 2 and 3 have both been shown to be present in the fly heart (Cammarato et al., 2011). Under microgravity conditions innexin 2 is significantly downregulated in both CS (−1.76-fold; p = 0.002) and in sei/hERG mutant hearts (−1.59-fold; p = 0.045), whereas innexin 3 expression is altered only in sei/hERG mutants (−1.8-fold; p = 0.002). Together with the reduction in genes encoding cell-adhesion proteins, it is likely that electrotonic coupling of the myocardial cells was impaired. Another surprising finding was the significant upregulation of genes encoding nearly every subunit of the proteasome. We were able to confirm that microgravity exposure resulted in an increase in protein aggregates and associated proteasome particles on a subsequent flight. The increase in polyQ-GFP aggregates and proteasome puncta suggests that microgravity induces dramatic changes in protein turnover and/or protein misfolding. Recent evidence indicates that oligomers, such as huntingtin/PolyQ proteins, bind to and inhibit proteasomes by preventing injection of proteins into the degradation chamber (Thibaudeau et al., 2018). Additionally, proteasome dysfunction has been suggested as a causative factor and is observed in a variety of cardiomyopathies (Gilda and Gomes, 2017), heart failure, and cardiac amyloidosis (Pattison et al., 2008; Sanbe et al., 2005). We have also shown in flies that cardiac amyloidosis caused structural remodeling reminiscent of the remodeling observed in flies reared in microgravity (Melkani et al., 2013). The increase in proteosome gene and protein expression in space may reflect increased turnover of sarcomeric proteins or may be a compensatory response to the likely muted proteosome function by misfolded and aggregated proteins. This interpretation is consistent with smaller hearts and less muscle mass, as in astronauts, and could be contributing to the observed cardiac remodeling and functional defects. Interestingly, in hearts from K+ channel mutants, expression of nearly all proteasome genes was already downregulated at 1g compared with WT controls. Nevertheless, proteasome gene expression was modestly upregulated in hearts from space-reared mutants suggesting that this may be a fundamental response of cardiac muscle to lowered gravity. It is likely that this generalized increase in proteasome content underlies cardiac muscle atrophy. In contrast to the increase in proteasomes, expression of proteolytic genes was generally downregulated in microgravity. Recent quantitative analyses of human cardiac fuel usage showed that non-failing hearts undergo proteolysis and actively secrete amino acids. This process was nearly doubled in failing versus non-failing hearts (Murashige et al., 2020). It was unclear whether upregulation of proteolysis was adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, it is interesting that SF fly hearts showed decreased expression, perhaps as a reflection of an overall reduction or shift in fuel usage by the heart under microgravity. The current studies examined the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, whereas the exposure of astronauts is more temporally limited. However, future space exploration efforts by government and commercial ventures are focused on missions to the moon, asteroids, and Mars, and those explorations will require astronauts to spend many months and perhaps years in altered gravity. Thus, information on how prolonged microgravity exposure affects different organ systems will be critical to the success of those efforts (Criscuolo et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2020). It is likely that, at the cellular level, there are underlying and conserved responses to altered gravity that are shared between organisms. Approximately 75% of disease-causing genes are conserved between flies and humans. Thus, the fly model can have a key role in elucidating the effects of microgravity during prolonged space flight, with significant advantages over other model systems because of its small size, its well defined and conserved genetics, and its relatively short lifespan.STAR★METHODS RESOURCE AVAILABILITY Lead Contact Additional information and/or requests for resources or reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr. Karen Ocorr (kocorr@sbpdiscovery.org).Materials Availability This study did not generate unique antibodies, genetic lines, reagents, software, or equipment.Data and Code Availability Included in Supplemental data is post-analysis normalized counts from DSeq2 for all identified genes across all samples sets in triplicate. Raw read counts and FASTQ files have been made available at the community-endorsed public repository at NASA Gene Lab https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-347.EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Fly rearing and μg exposure – Fly lines used in this study were Canton S laboratory WT lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and a K+ channel mutant seizure (seizurets1, a gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky). The sei/hERG mutants were previously isolated in a screen for ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS)-induced paralytic mutations on the second chromosome (Titus et al., 1997). Flies launched to the International Space Station (space flown, SF) and the corresponding ground controls (GC) were housed in polystyrene vials (75 x24 mm) with 10 mL of standard cornmeal-based fly food containing double the usual amount of 10% Tegosept and cellulose acetate plugs. Approximately 24 hours prior to launch, 15 vials were each loaded with 10 virgin females and 5 male adult flies. Loaded vials were placed in a Plexiglas tray and inserted into a vented fly box (VFB; Figure 1A), a modified version of a Nanoracks box. The VFB was placed into a canvas case for loading into the Dragon capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS-3 occurred at 19:25 UTC on April 18, 2014. Flies were kept in the VFB throughout the 30-day mission and were stored aboard the docked Dragon capsule that shared atmosphere with the ISS. The Dragon capsule unberthed at 13:26 UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) on May 18, 2014 and re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere occurred the same day at 19:05 UTC. Following retrieval of the Dragon capsule off the coast of Mexico, the VFB was offloaded at Long Beach Port, California and transported by car to La Jolla, California in a climate-controlled vehicle. Surviving adult flies were collected from the vials at 23:30 UTC on May 20, 2014. Data collection, which included heart function studies, tissue collection for RNaseq, and tissue preservation for immunohistochemistry, was completed by 07:30 UTC on May 21, 2014 on all μg space flown and corresponding ground control flies (specific methods described below). The protocol and associated timeline are outlined schematically in Figure 1. The VFB was oriented such that the g-load was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials. This orientation was maintained throughout the entirety of the mission, from point of transfer at the lab at NASA Kennedy Space Center through stowage on the Dragon capsule, and again from Dragon un-berthing to opening of the VFB in the lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. Ground control flies were prepared and reared under identical conditions in ground-based incubators with temperature and humidity controlled to levels recorded on the ISS. Following initial adult fly collections, vials were maintained for three days at 25°C and adults that emerged were collected and aged as a mixed sex cohort for two weeks at 1g (Space Flight Recovery, SFR). These flies were then analyzed as for SF and GC flies. Identical protocols were followed for the launch of the PolyQ46 flies aboard SpaceX CRS-11 on June 03, 2017 at 21:07 UTC until splashdown which occurred at 12:12 UTC on July 03, 2017. VFBs were again returned to Long Beach Port, California and transported via a climate-controlled vehicle to La Jolla, California on the same day, arriving at approximately 03:00 UTC on July 5, 2017. All dissections and fixation of heart tissue (described below) were performed within 48 hours of arrival in La Jolla.METHOD DETAILS Heart Function Assays – Flies were anaesthetized with FlyNap® (Carolina Biological Supply Co, Burlington, NC) and dissected in artificial hemolymph as previously described (Vogler and Ocorr, 2009). Cardiac function was assayed using high speed digital imaging (100-150fps, 9300 EM-CCD cameras, Hamamatsu Corp.). Heart function was quantified from movies using the Semi-automatic Optical Heartbeat Analysis software (SOHA; sohasoftware.com; Ocorr, 2009). Contractility was estimated based on end diastolic (EDD) and end systolic (ESD) diameters, measured from moves using SOHA. (i.e., fractional shortening = (EDD-ESD)/EDD). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated assuming the heart is a cylindrical tube, where volume was estimated using V = π(r2)x h, for a 1 micron portion of the tube (h = 1). Thus, Stroke Volume (SV) = (π(1/2(EDD2)−(π(1/2(ESD2) and cardiac output ©) = mean heart rate x SV.Immunohistochemistry – Dissected hearts previously used for the heart function assays were subsequently relaxed with EGTA (10mM in artificial hemolymph) and then immediately fixed for 20 minutes in a solution of hemolymph containing 4% paraformaldehyde. All hearts were stained as described in Alayari et al. (2009). Collagen IV was visualized using a monoclonal antibody against Pericardin, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Proteasomes were visualized using an antibody against 20S proteasome subunits a1,2,3,5,6 & 7 (BML-PW8195, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). PolyQ-GFP plaques were identified using Mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) F-actin was detected using Phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained hearts were visualized with a Zeiss Apotome microscope; Z stack images were captured and processed with Axiovision software (Zeiss). Pericardin, proteosome and polyQ46-GFP staining was quantified using the Weka Trainable Segmentation plugin in ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Individual slices from Z stack images of heart chambers were constructed by optical sectioning of the heart tube starting at a point below the non-cardiac longitudinal fibers. This optical sectioning revealed the pericardin fibers that interacted with the myofibrils in the dorsal myocardial cells. We selected a 350 × 150-pixel (90x 30 um) region of interest (ROI) centered over a heart chamber (Figures 3E and 3F) and a representative image (i.e., Figure S6, left panel) was used for training; the model generated by the training was then applied to all images. Particle counts and area measurements were performed on the segmentation output images (Figure S6, middle panel) using ImageJ analysis tools (Figure S6, right panel). Sarcomere numbers were quantified from Z stacks of hearts stained for F-actin(with phalloidin). Two to three 30um segments of single myofilaments were identified in myocardial cells from each heart (Figure S3) and the number of sarcomeres were counted and averaged for each heart.Cardiac RNaseq Analysis Gene expression analysis was performed on a subset of adult fly hearts from both 1g ground control flies and flies that spent their entire existence in μg. For each genotype, adult Drosophila were dissected under artificial hemolymph as described in Vogler and Ocorr (2009), on ice to expose the heart. These hearts were then carefully cleaned of surrounding fat cells, extracted, and pooled in groups of 6-15 hearts. Hearts were placed into tubes containing 300 μL of Qiazol lysis reagent, homogenized per the QIAGEN protocol, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to −80°C for storage. Total RNA from each sample was extracted and purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit from QIAGEN (Cat. No. 217004), yielding 173~551 ng of RNA eluted in 30 μL of RNase free water. The integrity of the extracted RNA was assessed by Agilent 2200 Tapestation system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), indicating RIN numbers in the range of 8.3 to 9.6. RNA samples of high quality and sufficient RNA quantities were selected for further processing.Libraries and sequencing Libraries of extracted RNA samples were built using the Illumina TruSeq™ RNA sample preparation kit and yielded fragments with 200~500 base pairs. The qualified fragments were ligated with indexed adapters, amplified and subjected for sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate paired end reads with a length of 100 bases.Pre-processing of heart RNA-seq Data A total of 8.02 billion reads were generated in FASTQ format for 24 samples, yielding coverage in the range of 35-152 bases for each sample. The quality of reads was evaluated by FASTX-Toolkit (Hannon Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA), where all reads indicated excellent quality with an average quality score of 37. The reads were then aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster genome Ensembl.BDGP5 using TopHat2 and Bowtie2 .The aligned reads were then assembled using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). The samples with low alignment rate and biased expression patterns were excluded from further analyses. Expression of mRNAsin qualified samples were then normalized as Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads (RPKM) by AltAnalyze (Salomonis et al., 2009). Genes with insufficient copy numbers were filtered out before conducting further statistical analyses.Differential expression and functional annotation clustering analysis of RNA-seq data Differentially expressed genes were determined using a one-way ANOVA analysis considering a p value of 0.05. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by comparing differentially expressed genes with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases using a Fisher’s exact test-based method (Evangelou et al., 2012) where p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantification methods for the various parameters are described in the relevant Methods Section.

Plant hormones, and especially auxin, have strong effects on the composition of actin filaments (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015). The actin cytoskeleton has been studied extensively; however, the role that it plays in regulating the growth of the primary root is complex and often yields conflicting data. We hereby review how actin helps root growth. We first discuss how actin filaments organize during root growth. Then, we dissect how individual components of the actin filaments and the actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Next, we describe the evidence on how the hormones controlling growth affect the actin cytoskeleton and finally we discuss how actin affects the root tropisms to gravity and light.Actin Organization and Dynamics Correlate with Root Cell Elongation The main region that sustains primary root growth is the root apical meristem (RAM) through a tight balance between cell division and elongation (Ioio et al., 2008; Reviewed in Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014; Ötvös et al., 2021). The actin cytoskeleton has been connected to root growth through its participation mainly in cell expansion and, secondarily, cell division (Ingouff et al., 2005; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). Root meristem cells undergo two steps of rapid cell elongation. The first one occurs in the progression between the apical meristem and the transition zone (TZ), which is triggered by an endoreduplication event. A second fast elongation takes place in the boundary of the transition and elongation zones (EZ), characterized by an increase in vacuolar enlargement accompanied by cell wall loosening and new material deposition (Reviewed in Verbelen et al., 2006; Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014; Barrada et al., 2015). Actin cytoskeleton dynamics have often been connected to root cell elongation. Initial studies in the monocot Zea mays pointed out specific actin arrangements depending on the cellular developmental stage in the longitudinal axis of the RAM. Immunolocalization revealed longitudinally oriented, often bundled, Filamentous actin (F-actin) in elongating cells while this disposition was lost during maturation (Baluška et al., 1997; Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997). Later, more detailed work has been done describing actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics in epidermal root cells of the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. There are clear differences between RAM zones (Figure 1); to start with, meristematic cells show a pattern of dense, highly disorganized actin, characterized by relatively low levels of bundling and reduced longitudinal orientation and parallel arrangement of microfilaments (Wang et al., 2004; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). The TZ shows comparable actin filament density to that of the meristem; microfilament orientation remains random but an increase in parallel organization is observed. Actin dynamics in this developmental stage are reduced, although there is an increase in annealing events (Takatsuka et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). An increase in longitudinal actin filament bundling occurs preceding the second fast growth event during the transition to the EZ (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Cells in the elongation zone show a pattern of a diffuse and less dense actin network with longitudinal bundled arrays that display higher dynamics and longer, faster growing actin filaments (Wang et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2011; Jacques et al., 2013; Vaškebová et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Actin filament network organization in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem and the effects of drugs, hormones, and gravity. Schematic representation of the actin filament networks in different cell types of the root meristem and the effect of drugs and hormones on the actin network. Thicker lines equal more bundling of actin filaments, while blue and red coloring denotes actin dynamics. Bottom right cell shows the role of actin filaments in repositioning the gravity-sensing statoliths.As a generalization, there is a correlation between root cell length and the presence of less dense, more bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments (see overview in Figure 1). We do not know whether these differences in actin organization are coupled to different roles of actin, or that it simply reflects the differences in cell morphology at different developmental stages. A useful way of correlating changes in actin with the effects on root growth is the analysis of the effects of actin-disrupting drugs on root growth (for a summary of drugs, see Table 1). Actin-stabilizing compounds such as phalloidin and Jasplakinolide, which interfere with the correct maturing of F-actin and prevent its turnover (Pospich et al., 2020), do not inhibit root growth. Actin-depolymerizing drugs Latrunculin B and Cytochalasin, which sequester actin monomers or bind to the ends of F-actin, respectively, were shown to inhibit root growth (Baluška et al., 2001; Mancuso et al., 2006). Latrunculin B induces a reduction in F-actin density and an increase in bundling accompanied by a reduction in filament elongation rate and dynamics (Staiger et al., 2009; Rosero et al., 2013). Actin disruption by Latrunculin B treatment seems to influence cell elongation rather than cell division in roots of both A. thaliana and Z. mays (Baluška et al., 2001). Thus, in this case it is clear that the increase in bundling of actin is not directly related to promoting root growth, but that other mechanisms are also important. The myosin ATPase inhibitor 2,3-Butanedione 2-Monoxime (BDM) impacts the myosin-based actin cytoskeleton movement and also disrupted root growth in both A. thaliana and Z. mays (Šamaj et al., 2000; Mancuso et al., 2006). Interestingly, BDM impacted myosin-based actin movement mainly in the transition zone and beginning of the elongation zone, thus affecting the progression to cell elongation (see overview in Figure 1; Šamaj et al., 2000).

Cell growth has been proposed to be driven by a sequential coordination between cell wall modification and turgor pressure changes (Zimmermann et al., 1980). In this context, a turgor pressure increase is expected to raise the mechanical pressure on the cell wall, aiding cell elongation (Reviewed in Kaiser and Scheuring, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to be key component of cell wall remodeling, mediating vesicle transport of cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, cell wall modifying enzymes (e.g., expansins) or non-cellulosic cell wall components (Baluška et al., 2002; Leucci et al., 2006; Crowell et al., 2009; Sampathkumar et al., 2013). It is thought that the actin cytoskeleton transports vesicles containing cell wall modifying components that promote cell elongation. This hypothesis is supported by the negative effect of Latrunculin B-mediated actin depolymerization on the dynamics of CESA-containing Golgi bodies in roots or the decreased delivery and uptake of pectins and other polysaccharide components of the cell wall observed in other plant tissues (Baluška et al., 2002; Leucci et al., 2006; Sampathkumar et al., 2013). Conversely, plant cells treated with the cell wall inhibitor isoxaben or mutants with decreased cellulose content show altered F-actin distribution (Tolmie et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2020). Another important player in maintaining turgor pressure in plant cells is vacuoles. Vacuolar occupancy of the cell increases with and correlates with cell elongation (Dünser et al., 2019). In other plant cell models such as BY-2 cells or stomata guard cells, actin has been shown to play an important role in vacuolar remodeling (Higaki et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013). Actin inhibitor studies have demonstrated the importance of a fully functional actin cytoskeleton for vacuolar shaping during primary root cell elongation. In root epidermal late meristematic cells, actin stabilization (Jasplakinolide) results in larger main vacuoles while actin disruption (Latrunculin B) induces the appearance of a round and smaller main vacuole, especially in cells prior to rapid second cell elongation (Scheuring et al., 2016). However, Takatsuka et al. (2018) show that no striking vacuolar changes occur prior to the second elongation event, indicating that they do not seem to be its trigger. In summary, longitudinally oriented actin bundles and increased actin dynamics are indicative of primary root cell elongation. Importantly, actin filaments seem to have a crucial role in the second rapid cell expansion of root cells. Why are these bundled and active filaments necessary for cell elongation in the root? Likely there are two important factors: First, actin filaments help to deliver cell wall remodeling components to the growing sides of the cell. There is a clear link between actin–myosin-mediated cytoplasmic streaming, endomembrane remodeling, and cell growth, suggesting that the organization of actin parallel to the growth axis could aid cell elongation by increasing delivery of endocytic cargoes (Peremyslov et al., 2012; Tominaga et al., 2013). Second, there is the plant-specific need to regulate a growing cells’ turgor pressure, which could be mediated by the vacuolar network. Root cell elongation is inversely correlated to vacuolar constriction and the two are tightly depending on specific actin organization and dynamics. However, the connection between vacuolar occupancy, actin, and root growth should be explored in more detail.The Role of Actin Isoforms and Actin-Binding Proteins in Primary Root Growth The actin cytoskeleton consists of actin filaments made up of strands of G-actin polymers of different isoforms, depending on the cell type, tissue, or specific cellular function. Proteins that bind to, interact with, and modify actin filaments to coordinate their orientation and dynamics, are crucial for the operation of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin nucleators promote de novo or branched filament assembly; actin-capping/severing proteins regulate the dynamics of actin filaments by mediating its turnover; network protein (NET) family members link actin and the endomembrane system; myosin motor proteins facilitate actin-based vesicle and organ motility. In the next section, we dissect which particular isoforms of actin are crucial for root growth and we discuss how and why various actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Actin G-actin is a highly conserved protein that is encoded by eight functional genes in plants. They can be classified, based on their sequence and temporal and spatial expression pattern, into two major groups: reproductive (ACT1, ACT3, ACT4, ACT11, and ACT12) and vegetative (ACT2, ACT7, and ACT8). The first class is expressed in pollen, ovules, and seeds while the second class is expressed in vegetative tissues, including some of the floral organs (e.g., petals, sepals, and carpel) and germinating seeds. All vegetative actins were observed to be strongly expressed in young roots (McDowell et al., 1996; Reviewed in Meagher et al., 1999, 2000; Šlajcherová et al., 2012). Of the vegetative actins, ACT7 seems most involved in shaping primary root growth, because act7 mutants have severe root elongation phenotypes and wavier roots (Gilliland et al., 2003; Kandasamy et al., 2009). At the tissue level, act7 had a reduction in cell number in the proximal meristem zone and an increase in cell number in the transition zone (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Actin organization analysis in act7 showed a delayed onset of longitudinal actin bundling at the boundary between the elongation and transition zones as observed in wild-type plants. This points to ACT7 as the main player in the second rapid cell elongation (Table 2; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018). The other two vegetative actin isoforms (ACT2 and ACT8) seem to have a more relevant role in root hair formation and only show root elongation phenotypes in dominant-negative mutants (act2-2D and frz1, respectively; Nishimura et al., 2003; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2010). Only when both isoforms are knocked out, the phenotype of act7 mutants could be mimicked, suggesting a secondary role of ACT2 and ACT8 in root cell elongation (Table 2) (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Consistent with phenotypical observations, act7-4 and not act2 act8 mutants show decreased vacuolar fragmentation in late meristematic epidermal cells, consistent with actin stabilization treatment by Jasplakinolide. This failure to regulate proper vacuolar constraining probably contributes to a delay in the initiation of fast cell elongation (Scheuring et al., 2016). The wavier root phenotypes observed in act7-4 and der1-2 (carrying an ACT2 point mutation) mutants correlate with the higher presence of oblique cell walls, also pointing to a role of these two isoforms in cytokinesis (Gilliland et al., 2003; Vaškebová et al., 2018).

The actin nucleators most relevant to main root growth are the actin-binding proteins belonging to the ARP2/3 complex and formins. The ARP2/3 complex is formed by seven subunits that are ubiquitously expressed throughout plant development (Klahre and Chua, 1999; Le et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; El-Assal et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2013a; García-González et al., 2020). Based on similarity to animal models, the ARP2/3 complex is hypothesized to participate in actin filament nucleation and branching. Although some of its subunits have been shown to colocalize with actin-branching sites, its function is yet to be demonstrated in planta (Fišerová et al., 2006). Other studies link the function of ARP2/3 to actin-microtubule interplay (Zhang et al., 2013a; Havelková et al., 2015; Cifrová et al., 2020). The lack of functional ARP2/3 complex subunits or its activators results in a reduction of primary root growth rate, accompanied by less cell divisions in the meristematic zone, more cells in the transition zone, and a shorter elongation zone (Dyachok et al., 2008, 2011; Takatsuka et al., 2018). The ARP2/3 complex requires upstream activation by the SCAR/WAVE complex (Reviewed in Yanagisawa et al., 2013). The SCAR/WAVE complex subunits BRK1 and SCAR1 were observed in the root tip epidermis up until the elongation zone, mainly in three-way cell junctions. brk1 and arp3 mutants show disorganized actin arrays in the elongation zone (Dyachok et al., 2011). Furthermore, the SCAR/WAVE complex seems to be involved in cell wall deposition in three-way junctions of root epidermal cells (Dyachok et al., 2008). Taken together, the actin pool coordinated by the ARP2/3 complex and its activators participate in the second rapid cell expansion at the boundary of the transition and elongation zones, presumably through its contribution to correct cell wall modification (Table 2). Formins are actin-binding proteins responsible for de novo actin nucleation, actin filament elongation and bundling. In angiosperms, two groups of formins exist, encoded by a total of 21 genes. Typically, class I formins are associated with membranes, while class II are cytoplasmic (Grunt et al., 2008; Reviewed in Cvrčková, 2012, 2013). The knowledge on the role of formins in root growth is scarce; however, it indicates a role in vesicle trafficking and endomembrane remodeling (Table 2). Class I formins FH1, FH4, and FH8 are expressed in roots (Deeks et al., 2005; Oulehlová et al., 2019). In particular, FH1 subcellular localization has been reported to vary according to the developmental stage in epidermal root cells. In the meristematic zone, FH1-GFP accumulates to cell plates of dividing cells and anticlinal walls. In the transition zone, plasmodesmata and tonoplast-associated FH1-GFP can be observed, while the signal is progressively lost toward the elongation and maturation zone. A free, mobile fraction of FH1-GFP dots could be observed throughout root cell development, which are likely associated with late endosomes (Oulehlová et al., 2019). Although fh1 plants do not show a clear root elongation phenotype unless treated with Latrunculin B, a phenomenon very likely due to functional redundancy of formins. Latrunculin B treatment causes an increase in bundling and a decrease in actin dynamics, especially in the differentiation zone (Rosero et al., 2013). Microtubule dynamics are also affected in the fh1 mutant, indicating again the importance of the crosstalk between actin and microtubules (Rosero et al., 2013). Furthermore, these data suggest a role of FH1 in regulating root cell elongation through the maintenance of endomembrane system dynamics. FH8 is expressed mainly in the root meristem, and its subcellular localization is in the nucleus in interphase cells and in the phragmoplast during cytokinesis, suggesting a role of FH8 in cell division. fh8 mutant plants have no reduced root growth phenotype, except for an increased sensitivity to Latrunculin B treatment (Xue et al., 2011), similar to the fh1 mutant. The absence of a clear phenotype in fh8 mutants does not exclude the possibility of a role of this formin in root growth, as suggested by expression data. Another class I formin, FH5, has also been observed to participate in cytokinesis in root meristematic cells (Ingouff et al., 2005). These cases highlight the importance of breaking genetic redundancy in these sizeable protein families. Class II formins have been less studied regarding root growth. A double null mutant allele of the RMD formin has shorter elongation zone cells accompanied by an increased amount of transversally arranged actin bundles. This results in a wavy root phenotype and reduced root growth rate (Li et al., 2014). In the double RMD formin mutant, increased persistence of FM4-64-labeled and OsPIN2 BFA bodies after treatment washout showed that endomembrane vesicle trafficking was impaired in this mutant (Li et al., 2014).Actin-Capping/Severing Proteins Villins are versatile calcium-responsive actin-binding proteins that can modify actin dynamics by depolymerizing, capping, severing, and bundling actin filaments. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes five villin paralogs which are widely expressed (Klahre et al., 2000; Khurana et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Reviewed in Huang et al., 2015). Although no root elongation phenotypes have been reported for villin mutants, VLN2, VLN3, and VLN4 have been shown to be facilitators of actin turnover and bundling in epidermal root cells (Table 2). The double mutant vln2 vln3 shows twisted roots and vln4 has altered root bending upon gravistimulation (van der Honing et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2019). It is possible that higher-order mutants are needed to unveil a role of villins in primary root length determination, but the above-mentioned defects in root bending and twisting of villin mutants indicates that they are required for the fine tuning of root directional growth (van der Honing et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2019). ADF/cofilins are a family of actin-binding proteins that promote depolymerization, severing and bundling of actin filaments. There are 11 ADF genes that can be divided into two subfamilies: D-type ADFs with depolymerizing activities (ADF1-4, ADF6-8, and ADF10-11) and B-type ADFs with bundling activity (ADF5 and ADF9; Nan et al., 2017). Expression analysis of the members of this family has shown that all ADFs except ADF7 and ADF10 are expressed in root tissues of which ADF1, ADF5, and ADF6 in the vasculature, ADF5 and ADF9 in the RAM and ADF8 and ADF11 in trichoblasts (Dong et al., 2001a; Kandasamy et al., 2007; Ruzicka et al., 2007). ADF1 overexpression induced shorter roots, consistent with the phenotype observed when plants are treated with actin-depolymerizing drugs such as Latrunculin B. In contrast, reduced expression of ADF1 resulted in longer roots. Research in hypocotyls showed an increase of actin bundling in mutants with decreased ADF1 expression (Dong et al., 2001b). ADF2-RNAi lines show increased actin density and bundling in roots but no visible root phenotype other than an occasional reduction in root apical meristem size, similar to the effect obtained with the actin-stabilizing drug Jasplakinolide (Clément et al., 2009). Once more, ADF genetic redundancy may be the key to the lack of observable root phenotypes in knockout mutants, but the increase in actin bundling and density in the respective mutants suggests that ADF1 and ADF2 specifically are involved in increasing actin turnover in root epidermis. This is a hint of their function in root elongation; however, more research is needed to uncover the importance of other ADFs in this process. ACTIN INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (AIP1) is facilitating the activity of ADF/cofilin proteins and has a function in capping the barbed end of actin filaments (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Consistent with the effect observed by drugs like Cytochalasin D, AIP1-RNAi lines show reduced root growth accompanied by a general increase in actin bundling (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Downregulation of AIP1 expression leads to reduced FM4-64 internalization comparable to the effect observed after Jasplakinolide treatment. The phenotype observed is possibly a consequence of actin filament stabilization (Dhonukshe et al., 2008). Profilins regulate the pool of available G-actin to inhibit de novo polymerization and the addition of new monomers to existing filaments; they also contribute to depolymerization and monomer recycling (Michelot et al., 2005; Reviewed in Blanchoin et al., 2010). Profilins belong to a multigene family and can be divided into two main groups: vegetative (PRF1–PRF3) and reproductive (PRF4 and PRF5; Kandasamy et al., 2002). The vegetative profilin gene PRF1 has higher promoter activity in the elongation zone (Ramachandran et al., 2000). Analysis of prf1 knockout lines resulted in contradicting root length phenotypes that overall indicate a role for PRF1 in regulating root growth (Ramachandran et al., 2000; McKinney et al., 2001; Müssar et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016). The prf3 mutant has no observable root growth phenotype and overexpression of PRF3 induces either WT-like or shorter roots (Fan et al., 2013; Müssar et al., 2015). PRF1 was shown to maintain actin filament density in elongation zone root epidermal cells (Cao et al., 2016). Analysis of actin dynamics in hypocotyl cells suggests a role of PRF1 in the positive regulation of actin turnover through the facilitation of nucleation of other actin pools through formin activity (Cao et al., 2016). Though, it is likely that different profilins regulate the dynamics of distinct pools of actin, therefore producing different phenotypes.Actin-Membrane Binding Proteins The network (NET) family of proteins are linkers between actin and the endomembrane system. They are characterized by the presence of a conserved F-actin-binding domain in the N-terminal region. Several members of this family have been described to connect the actin cytoskeleton to different membrane compartments; however, the exact mechanism of NET proteins action to modulate the actin cytoskeleton remains to be determined (Deeks et al., 2012; Reviewed in Wang and Hussey, 2015). NET1A and NET1B connect F-actin to the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata. Both are expressed in the root meristem and early elongation zone and the double knockout mutant net1a net1b has shorter roots (Deeks et al., 2012). NET4 is localized to the tonoplast and is also expressed in the root meristem and early elongation zone. While net4a net4b show no root growth phenotype, NET4A overexpression induces shorter roots. Both mutants display higher cellular vacuolar occupancy. However, net4a net4b show a more fragmented vacuolar network than NET4A-GFPOE, reminiscent of the effect obtained by Latrunculin B and Jasplakinolide treatment (e.g., depolymerization and stabilization of actin, respectively). Increase in NET4 expression leads to more constricted vacuoles and failure to establish the onset of cell elongation. Higher amounts of NET4 are present in the late meristematic/transition zone, correlating with regions of high vacuolar constrictions (Scheuring et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2019). These results again indicate the impact of actin on vacuolar occupancy and consequently on root growth.Motor Proteins Myosins are actin-binding motor proteins with multiple roles, mainly known for their role in vesicle and organelle motility. Increasing evidence also points to their involvement in the control of actin organization and dynamics. Two myosin families have been described in angiosperms: myosin VIII, which are found at the cell cortex presumably creating tension through actin, and myosin XI which are intracellular and colocalize with several organelles, some of unknown identity (Reviewed in Ryan and Nebenführ, 2018). Triple myosin mutants in Arabidopsis (xi-k/1/2, xi3ko for short) have reduced hypocotyl and root growth. Specifically, roots have shorter cells at the elongation zone accompanied by a less dense, more bundled, and randomly oriented actin. This coincides with a failure of the xi3ko mutant to coordinate constriction of the vacuole in late meristem cells, similar to the above-mentioned act7-4 mutant or the NET4-GFPOE overexpressing mutants (Scheuring et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2019). Also, actin dynamics are slowed down with less severing frequency which probably leads to a reduced vesicle delivery (Peremyslov et al., 2010; Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015). This correlates with the results obtained in previous studies using the myosin inhibitor BDM and further confirms the importance of myosin XI in regulating actin dynamics and cell elongation (Šamaj et al., 2000). In summary, all the components of the actin network, including actin monomers themselves, have a high degree of functional redundancy and functional specialization. Therefore, it is not always straightforward to draw conclusions on their effects on the regulation of root growth. However, in many cases overexpression, silencing, or knockout of actin components seems to reduce root growth, except for ADF1 knockout, which increases root length. This suggests that disrupting the actin network often has a detrimental effect, considering that different actin-modifying proteins have various effects on actin organization (see Table 2). However, superficially similar effects can also be masked by effects of actin organization in vacuolar size and occupancy, or by effects on hormone trafficking, which will be discussed in the next section.Hormonal Regulation of Actin-Mediated Primary Root Growth Primary root growth plasticity depends on the very tight balance between cell division, cell elongation, and cell differentiation. The rapid adjustment to new stimuli is mediated by the coordinated action of a complex network of plant hormones. However, as the previous sections showed, the actin cytoskeleton also plays an important role here. Often hormones lead to changes in actin, and actin changes lead to differences in hormone distribution. In this section, we focus on the role of the actin cytoskeleton in hormonal control of primary root growth, and especially the role of auxin, the most-studied hormone in this context. The Auxin-Actin Feedback Loop Modulates Root Development Auxin is the most studied and important plant hormone in relation to the regulation of the actin network in the context of main root growth. Changes in the actin network have a strong effect on polar auxin transport. Conversely, auxin has a significant effect on the actin cytoskeleton itself (Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015; Zhu et al., 2016; Sahi et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton response to auxin has been predominantly analyzed in the root epidermis transition and elongation zones, as this hormone is strongly involved in root cell elongation during root growth and tropic responses. Actin inhibitor studies have shown that Cytochalasin D or Latrunculin B treatment alters the plasma membrane distribution of the auxin efflux carriers PIN1 and PIN3, which are key regulators of tropic growth (Geldner et al., 2001; Friml et al., 2002). Conversely, auxin treatment is known to inhibit root growth and cell elongation (Table 1; Evans et al., 1994; Rahman et al., 2007; Fendrych et al., 2018). Initial studies with the native auxin Indole-3-Acetic-Acid (IAA) reported contradicting effects on actin filament bundling (Rahman et al., 2007; Nick et al., 2009; Lanza et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2017). The differences between these studies suggest that precise concentration, duration, form of auxin, and root cell developmental status appear to be an important driver of actin changes. However, detailed quantitative analysis of IAA treatment reported a significative increase in density, unbundling, and higher organization of actin filaments in elongating cells of the root, which is generally maintained even after 60 min of treatment (Figure 1; Table 1; Lanza et al., 2012; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). These changes in actin organization, induced by IAA treatment, are consistent with the general trend that less bundled actin filaments are associated with less cell elongation. The synthetic auxin 1-Naphtalene-Acetic-Acid (NAA) was suggested to inhibit root growth through the actin-mediated increase of vacuolar constriction in late meristematic cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, vacuoles of plants pre-treated with actin-disrupting drugs show less sensitivity to external auxin (Table 1; Scheuring et al., 2016). The auxin analog 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) affects root growth through the inhibition of both cell division and cell elongation (Table 1; Rahman et al., 2007). Unlike IAA, 2,4-D effects mimic those of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B (Figure 1). 2,4-D treatment disturbs auxin signaling via a different ubiquitin ligase complex than IAA, the SMAP1-SCFTIR1 complex, thereby affecting post-translational modifications of actin (Rodríguez-Serrano et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2017). Each auxin analog employed in the above-mentioned studies differentially affects auxin signaling, which allows us to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of auxin-dependent actin responses (Ma and Robert, 2014). Auxin can also affect the actin cytoskeleton via the activation of transcription: promoter activity of the vegetative actin ACT7 and transcription of several subunits of the actin nucleator ARP2/3 complex are enhanced by auxin treatment (Kandasamy et al., 2001; García-González et al., 2020). A feedback loop exists between auxin signaling and the actin cytoskeleton: treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) inhibits root growth by reducing cell division rate and induces a reduction in actin filament density (Rahman et al., 2007). In hypocotyls, NPA treatment leads to an increase in actin filament bundling and a decrease in actin bundle density in hypocotyl cells, without disturbing long actin filaments. Plants lacking the actin isoform ACT7 (act7-4) are insensitive to NPA treatment (Zhu et al., 2016). Moreover, actin seems to be required for the correct expression, localization, and trafficking of auxin carriers. act7-4 mutants have reduced expression of ABCB transporters, altered localization of PIN1 and PIN2, and increased endosomal retention of auxin transporters (Zhu et al., 2016). The wavy phenotype of act2-5 lines is connected to the delocalization from the plasma membrane of PIN2 (Lanza et al., 2012). When treated with Latrunculin B, PIN2 accumulates into intracellular vesicles and disappears largely from the plasma membrane (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2009; Glanc et al., 2019). These results indicate the importance of the actin network on the trafficking of hormone transporters. Other actin-binding protein mutants, such as the rice class II formin RMD and VILLIN4, show reduced polar auxin transport in roots (Li et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2019). Furthermore, the expression of the above-mentioned RMD gene in rice is facilitated by the action of the TIR/AFB1 pathway-dependent OsARF23 and OsARF24 (Li et al., 2014). Further work revealed that the auxin influx carrier AUX1 was necessary to mediate the actin filament response triggered by auxin treatment in roots (Arieti and Staiger, 2020). It appears that auxin and actin are very much interlinked via the control of polar auxin transport by actin dynamics, or via the direct or transcriptional effects of auxin on the same actin dynamics. Exactly how these two important players feedback on each other and create coordinated development and tropisms is still a topic with many questions. Especially interesting is the mechanistic connection between the intracellular transport of vesicles containing auxin transporters and the status of the actin network, or the way in which auxin sensing is quickly translated into changes in the actin network.Other Hormones Besides auxin, other hormones have been connected to actin organization during primary root growth, although they have been studied with less depth. For instance, brassinosteroid treatment induces a wavy phenotype that correlates with an increase of finer, shorter and more dynamic actin filaments in epidermal cells (Lanza et al., 2012). The observed phenotypes are comparable to those resulting from ACT2 mutation. Furthermore, both brassinosteroid treatment and act2-5 mutation result in PIN2 delocalization in the root epidermis. This suggests that brassinosteroids, auxin, and actin have a shared pathway regulating root waving (Table 1; Lanza et al., 2012). Cytokinin treatment decreases root growth via a reduction in meristem size (Ioio et al., 2007; Růzǐčka et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018). Cytokinin has a negative effect on auxin signaling through its inhibition in the transition zone (Figure 1; Reviewed in Vanstraelen and Benková, 2012; Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014; Wybouw and De Rybel, 2019). The response to cytokinin is mediated through the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton at the boundary between the transition and elongation zone, as observed by an increase in actin bundling and a decrease in actin filament density after treatment (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Also, an increase in cytokinin was shown to disrupt the longitudinal rearrangement of actin filaments in roots, in agreement with the tendency of longitudinally organized actin bundles to induce root growth (Kushwah et al., 2011). The actin cytoskeleton seems to be a nexus in mediating the complex responses to auxin during root growth. Generally, auxin tends to induce more longitudinally organized and less bundled filaments, while cytokinin tends to induce an increase in bundling and less organized actin filaments. Current models suggest that there is a cytokinin-dependent generation of an auxin minimum starting at the transition zone (Reviewed in Rutten and Tusscher, 2019). This hormone gradient correlates with the start of cell elongation and the increase in actin organization toward a more bundled and longitudinally oriented network in the elongation zone. Failure to generate the proper hormone gradients results in growth inhibition. Exactly how hormone gradients lead to changes in actin filament organization is not very clear. In the case of auxin and cytokinin it is likely auxin, which has the terminal effect, while cytokinin controls the auxin gradient. This notion could be tested by tissue-specific inhibition of cytokinin signaling to disturb the auxin gradient. However, only the systematic and comparative analysis of actin organization in specific cell types in response to the manipulation of hormonal pathways will unveil the existing interdependence in cytoskeletal control. Furthermore, the involvement of specific actin-binding proteins downstream of hormone signaling would contribute to understanding which actin organization and dynamics modifications are more relevant. Auxin and cytokinin are also very important for the regulation of root tropisms. This is the stage for another interaction between hormones and actin, which we will discuss next.Actin Control of Primary Root Tropisms and Light Response Root plasticity relies on the ability of the root to direct its growth toward or against a stimulus. For the primary root tip this is achieved mostly through asymmetric cell expansion that allows for its bending. Mainly two tropisms have been studied in relation to actin: positive gravitropism and negative phototropism. In both cases actin is involved in both stimuli perception and response. Gravitropism Primary root directional growth is a multistep process that goes from gravity sensing to signal transduction and response execution. The gravity vector is sensed by sedimenting statoliths which results in the relocalization of PIN auxin transporters and a differential auxin gradient, causing differential growth of cells between top and bottom of the root tip (Reviewed in Su et al., 2017). Statoliths are amyloplasts functioning in gravity perception and sediment in the central columella cells when the root orientation changes. This sedimentation has been recognized as the primary process controlling gravity perception (Sack, 1997; Reviewed in Nakamura et al., 2019). A fine network of F-actin surrounds statoliths in central columella cells. The results from actin cytoskeleton inhibitors and knockout mutants of the actin network components show that F-actin is involved in the regulation of statolith repositioning (Figure 1; White and Sack, 1990; Baluška and Hasenstein, 1997; Volkmann et al., 1999; Voigt et al., 2005; Reviewed in Blancaflor, 2013). Actin disruption by Latrunculin B or Cytochalasin D and the inhibition of myosin activity by BDM enhance root tip bending to gravity, while the actin-stabilizers Jasplakinolide or phalloidin inhibit the gravitropic response (Hou et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Mancuso et al., 2006). Latrunculin B treatment results in faster statolith relocalization which indicates that the fine actin network fine-tunes statolith movement and repositioning after gravistimulus (Hou et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2015). To date, the only actin-binding protein that has been connected to statolith sedimentation and PIN relocalization during the root gravitropic response is the ARP2/3 complex (Reboulet et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2016). Knock-out of the ARP2/3 subunit ARP3 leads to a slower gravitropic response which is associated with reduced statolith sedimentation and an increase in actin bundling around statoliths (Reboulet et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2016). The E3 ubiquitin ligase SGR9 mediates at least part of the interaction between the actin network and statoliths. Plants lacking SGR9 show impaired statolith sedimentation resulting in a reduced gravitropic response, accompanied by an abnormal actin filament network around statoliths. This phenotype could be rescued by the application of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B, suggesting a role of SGR9 in releasing statoliths from the actin cytoskeleton through its interactors (Nakamura et al., 2011). These experiments studied the statoliths in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem and not in roots. However, the mechanism of gravity perception between roots and shoots is likely to be very comparable at the statolith level. Further work should elucidate whether the same mechanism exists in roots. Additionally, it would be interesting to know which actin-binding proteins interact with SGR9. Experiments with decapped roots, laser ablation of columella cells, starch-less mutants, or maintaining the root cap at a specific angle suggest an alternative gravisensing mechanism at the distal elongation zone, out of the root cap (Wolverton et al., 2002, 2011; Mancuso et al., 2006). Our combined knowledge points to a significant role of actin in gravity perception via the mediation of statolith sedimentation. However, the actin cytoskeleton has also been proposed to mediate PIN3 relocalization to the lateral plasma membrane in columella cells upon gravistimulation. PIN3 clathrin-mediated endocytosis is naturally increased when seedlings are re-oriented, a phenomenon that can be enhanced by Latrunculin B treatment (Friml et al., 2002; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). This represents a connection between actin and gravity signal transduction through the regulation of the asymmetric redistribution of auxin. It is likely that actin is involved in the delivery of endocytic cargoes containing PIN3 to the plasma membrane. Further downstream, actin bundles could mediate the asymmetric growth of the root meristem during the gravitropic response. Although a change toward more oblique oriented microfilaments has been observed in stele cells upon gravistimulation, no clear correlation between actin organization in epidermal cells and root asymmetric growth has been determined (Blancaflor, 2002; Pozhvanov et al., 2013). Evidence in support of a direct role of actin in the asymmetric cell growth of the root tip is the observations that vesicle trafficking is defective in root epidermal cells of various actin and actin-binding protein mutants (Li et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2016; Oulehlová et al., 2019). The process of root-negative phototropism, where the root tip bends away from a blue or red light source, is also partly regulated via actin, since it is regulated via the same auxin transporters as gravitropism (Wan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013b). In summary, actin has a role in the sedimentation and repositioning of statoliths which determines the strength of gravity perception. It is not yet clear to what extent the F-actin network is responsible for relaying the mechanical signal of sedimenting statoliths to a differential PIN distribution and gravitropic growth.Effects of Light on Actin Organization in Roots The processes of gravitropism and root growth in general are heavily influenced by light perception (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). When a seedling is exposed to light, hypocotyl growth is reduced, cotyledons open and make chlorophyll, while root length growth strongly increases. Seedlings growing fully in darkness have a strongly reduced root growth (Sassi et al., 2012). Actin filaments in elongating root cells are normally vertically oriented and bundled. However, in darkness, actin oriented seemingly randomly, with less bundling, and less alignment (Dyachok et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been shown that PRF1 is important for root growth and development during photomorphogenesis (McKinney et al., 2001). Even though roots normally grow covered from light in the soil, Arabidopsis roots express all types of common photoreceptors in plants, including the Far-Red light sensor PHYA (Reviewed in van Gelderen et al., 2018). Seedling roots grown in Far-Red light have a bundled actin organization, mostly resembling growth in white light, but in a phyA mutant, actin organization was more resembling that of dark-grown seedlings (Dyachok et al., 2011). This is an example of a direct link between light perception and actin organization in roots. However, most studies focus on the effects of light quality and quantity in above ground tissues, such as the hypocotyl epidermis (Henty et al., 2011) or stomatal guard cells (Iwabuchi et al., 2010). Current standard growth conditions keep roots exposed to light, but roots have not evolved to grow exposed to light and therefore efforts have been made in the past years to grow Arabidopsis roots in the dark, while keeping the shoot in light. A notable example of this is the D-root system, which is simply a dark cover around a square agar plate to shield the root from light, with an added insert at the shoot-root boundary (Silva-Navas et al., 2015). This system showed that covering the roots leads to increased root growth and less free radical production compared to the roots exposed to light (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). Using an alternative root shading method to D-root it was demonstrated that components of the SCAR/WAVE-ARP2/3 system BRK1 and SCAR1 are involved in regulating root growth in covered roots (Dyachok et al., 2011). The subcellular localization of BRK1-YFP changes from occurring at three-way junctions of cells to cytoplasmic upon darkness. SCAR1 is reduced in protein extracts from both soluble and membrane extract, and the central light regulator COP1 is involved in SCAR1 degradation (Dyachok et al., 2011). Therefore, it seems clear that actin has a significant role to play in the regulation of root growth by light. However, very little work has been done until now to further explore this connection. It is also of especial importance to do this in systems such as D-root to simulate the light conditions of the soil in order to obtain results that are relevant for plant growth in field or natural conditions.Concluding Remarks and Future Perspective The actin network has been studied for a long time and there is a relatively large body of earlier work on the role of actin in regulating root growth. In the recent 5 years, this work has been revisited and expanded upon (Abu-Abied et al., 2018; Takatsuka et al., 2018; Oulehlová et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020; de Bang et al., 2020). Although this sometimes led to contradictory or incomplete findings, the actin network is essential for root growth by regulating cell elongation and division. A main conclusion is that actin organization is developmentally regulated in the growing root tip. Bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments are a hallmark of cell elongation. Failure to achieve this arrangement by tampering with hormonal homeostasis or altering actin-binding protein function results in root growth defects. Most results with hormone and drug treatments and actin-binding protein mutants seem to correlate well with this general principle. These changes in actin organization affect cell growth in different ways, and of particular interest for further study is how actin-mediated delivery of cell wall modifying components aids cell elongation of the primary root meristem. There are also causal links between actin, vacuolar morphology, and cell elongation. However, more evidence is needed to show that defects in actin directly cause defects in vacuolar morphology that subsequently cause root growth defects. Knowledge in this field is lacking evidence on the role of actin-binding proteins in regulating the actin network with regard to growth and development of the root meristem. In general, actin-binding proteins are well studied, however, with respect to root growth, there is little data available on phenotypic effects, usually due to a high degree of genetic redundancy. Overexpression often leads to detrimental effects on root growth, while single or even double mutants do not. With recent advances in CRISPR multiplexing, this redundancy problem can be tackled efficiently and the roles of actin-binding proteins in root growth and development can and should be elucidated. Hormonal regulation of primary root growth occurs mainly through the coordination between auxin and cytokinin signaling, which contributes to the generation of developmental regions with a specific actin organization. The role of auxins, cytokinins, and especially other hormones in the control of the actin cytoskeleton requires more future work. This work would be made easier by the consistent and more precise denomination of which root zones and cell layers are analyzed, in order to compare the effects of individual hormones and their combination in the control of the actin network. Related to this is the study of root gravitropism, where actin has several different functions. It is involved in the direct sensing of gravity, controls the propagation of the hormone signal and it is likely involved in the subsequent regulation of cell elongation. This study brings together three different roles for actin and is therefore a very interesting subfield, which will benefit by recent advances in live imaging. With vertically oriented confocal laser scanning microscopes it is possible to study root gravitropism in vivo in real time and see details and subtleties not imaged before. Another new way of studying actin will be to use new optogenetic tools that allow the direct manipulation of the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal components (Zhang et al., 2021), which might provide a deeper understanding of how actin functions in regulating cell elongation in complex tissues such as the root. With these new possibilities it will be possible to subtly disturb the actin network while imaging it at the highest temporal and spatial resolution.Author Contributions All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.Funding This work was funded by the Czech Science Foundation (19-13375Y; JG-G) and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research Vici grant 865.17.002 to Ronald Pierik (KG).Conflict of Interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.Publisher’s Note All claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.

Copyright notice ID: 4826010 PMID: 26941089 A forward-genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants hypersensitive to latrunculin B identifies HLB1 as a plant-specific protein that functions in post-Golgi traffic.Abstract The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.INTRODUCTION Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole (Kim and Brandizzi, 2014; Kim et al., 2015). In addition, protein traffic through endomembranes is pivotal for specifying how plants respond and adapt to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses (Chen et al., 2008; Lozano‐Durán et al., 2014; Garcia de la Garma et al., 2015). The endomembrane system is highly dynamic and consists of a network of functionally interconnected organelles beginning with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where proteins are synthesized and then trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole after processing and sorting in the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi organelles (Richter et al., 2009; Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013). Recycling and degradation of PM proteins, which also are facilitated by the endomembrane trafficking machinery, are essential for establishing and maintaining the polar localization of lipids and critical proteins, including auxin carriers, transmembrane receptors, channels, and ion transporters that regulate diverse physiological processes in plants (Geldner et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon and Geldner, 2014; Hachez et al., 2014; Doyle et al., 2015). Among the various organelles that comprise the endomembrane system, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is arguably the most mysterious. The complexity of TGN function stems from the fact that it lies at the intersection of secretory and endocytic pathways, through which cargo destined for the PM and vacuole transit (Contento and Bassham, 2012; Gendre et al., 2015). In contrast to mammalian cells, there is mounting evidence that the TGN in plants functions as an early endosome (EE) that directly receives cargo taken up via endocytosis for recycling back to the PM or directed to the vacuole for degradation (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010). In recent years, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of the plant TGN. Using transmission electron tomography on high-pressure frozen Arabidopsis thaliana roots, for example, it was shown that the formation of the TGN occurs through distinct structural changes including separation of trans-most Golgi cisterna via a peeling mechanism and secretory vesicle budding from the plane of the original trans-Golgi cisterna (Kang et al., 2011). In another study, live-cell spinning-disc confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells uncovered the formation of thin tube-like protrusions connecting two TGN/EE units prior to their homotypic fusion (Viotti et al., 2010). Furthermore, live-cell super-resolution microscopy described two types of TGN in Arabidopsis roots: a Golgi-associated TGN on the trans-side of the Golgi apparatus and a Golgi-independent TGN that moved independently of Golgi bodies (Uemura et al., 2014). In addition to new knowledge about its structure and dynamics, several protein components of the plant TGN have been discovered that mediate crucial aspects of post-Golgi membrane traffic and maintain TGN integrity. These TGN resident proteins include soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, the so-called SYNTAXINS of PLANTS (SYPs), vacuolar H+-ATPases, adaptor protein complexes, small monomeric GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and RAS genes from rat brain (RAB) families, and the ECHIDNA/YPT/RAB GTPase complex (Dettmer et al., 2006; Chow et al., 2008; Zouhar et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2011, 2013; Uemura et al., 2012; Asaoka et al., 2013; Naramoto et al., 2014). Whereas many of the plant TGN-localized proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, some appear to be unique to the plant post-Golgi trafficking machinery (Ebine et al., 2008, 2011; Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012), and it is likely that more factors remain uncharacterized. Mobility of organelles within the cell is typically driven by the cytoskeleton, a network of filamentous proteins that consists of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microfilaments, also known as filamentous actin (F-actin), assemble in an energy-dependent manner from monomeric globular actin (G-actin) units to form two-stranded, helical structures that are ∼5 to 7 nm in diameter (Li et al., 2014). The higher order organization of the actin cytoskeleton consists mostly of bundles and cables, and their assembly into these structures is specified by several actin binding proteins such as fimbrin, villin, profilin, LIM domain-containing proteins, thrumin, and crolin (Papuga et al., 2010; Whippo et al., 2011; Su et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2013; Qu et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013). The movement and dynamics of the ER and the various organelles that make up the plant endomembrane system are largely dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated using actin-disrupting drugs such as latrunculin B (LatB) and cytochalasin D (Boevink et al., 1998; Nebenführ et al., 1999; Sparkes et al., 2009). However, actin appears to be dispensable for protein transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus (Brandizzi et al., 2002). While it was shown that cargo traffic from the Golgi to the vacuoles requires an intact actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are unknown (Kim et al., 2005). There is a wealth of information on the relationship between post-Golgi traffic and its mediation by the actin cytoskeleton in yeast and animal cells. Most of the evidence to date in these systems has pointed toward a pivotal role for F-actin and its associated regulatory and motor proteins in post-Golgi vesicle biogenesis and membrane deformation (Anitei and Hoflack, 2012). In mammalian HeLa cells, for example, myosin 1b was shown to generate the forces that regulate the assembly of F-actin foci for tubule formation at the TGN (Almeida et al., 2011). In another class of mammalian cells called 3T3, the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex and their activators in the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family drive the nucleation of F-actin on endosomes, which is necessary to promote endosome fission (Derivery et al., 2009). Recently, a combination of elegant optical tweezer and live-cell confocal imaging in human epithelial cells demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton confers rigidity to the Golgi complex, making it stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. It was proposed that mechanical stress imposed by actin affects membrane budding and fission during intra-Golgi transport (Guet et al., 2014). In plants, several actin binding proteins appear to link actin dynamics with membrane trafficking. Many of these proteins, such as the ARP2/3 complex, profilin, formins, and capping proteins, which localize to the PM and various membranes of organelles within the endomembrane system, have orthologs in other eukaryotes (Zhang et al., 2010, 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2014; Cvrčková et al., 2015). In fact, some of the mechanisms by which F-actin on membranes is nucleated and polymerized in plants mirror those of animals and yeast, where small GTPases of the Rho family directly activate membrane-localized actin nucleators (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007). For example, genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis showed that a Rho of plants (ROP)-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein called SPIKE1 regulates F-actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex (Basu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010). Recently, a number of plant-specific proteins that function as actin membrane adaptors have been uncovered. One example is RISAP, a TGN-localized ROP-GTPase effector that interacts with F-actin and binds to the globular tail domain of myosin XI in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes. RISAP is ∼33% identical to the Arabidopsis family of myosin binding proteins at the amino acid level (Peremyslov et al., 2013). It was proposed that the RISAP-mediated interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane system is an essential component of the tip growth machinery in pollen tubes (Stephan et al., 2014). Another family of plant-specific proteins that mediate actin-endomembrane crosstalk is the 13-member Networked (NET) proteins. These NET proteins interacted directly with F-actin through a conserved N-terminal domain. The NET proteins were also shown to localize to PM-ER contact sites and the tonoplast (Deeks et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein called HLB1 (for HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1) through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis seedlings for mutants that exhibited differential responses to the inhibitory effects of LatB on primary root growth. We determined that HLB1 tracks along F-actin and colocalizes with the TGN/EE in vivo and that hlb1 has marked defects in the recycling of proteins to the PM after endocytic uptake. Furthermore, we identified the ARF-GEF, MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009), as an HLB1 interactor and showed that hlb1 functions in a common genetic pathway as min7/ben1 in regard to LatB hypersensitivity despite their opposite effects on membrane trafficking. These findings are significant because they support the conclusion that HLB1 represents a class of plant-specific proteins that function at the crossroads of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways, possibly through mechanisms coordinated by the actin cytoskeleton.RESULTS Isolation and Characterization of Arabidopsis Mutants Hypersensitive to LatB Approximately 20,000 T-DNA activation-tagged seedlings in the Col-0 background were grown on media supplemented with 100 nM LatB. Seedlings with significantly reduced primary root length were isolated and their progeny were retested for increased LatB sensitivity. Three nonallelic mutants whose primary roots were hypersensitive to LatB were identified and hlb1 was selected for further study (Figures 1A to 1D). Hypocotyls of hlb1 grown in the dark and root hairs of light-grown seedlings were also hypersensitive to LatB (Supplemental Figure 1). Moreover, hlb1 primary roots displayed increased sensitivity to cytochalasins, another class of actin-disrupting compounds (Supplemental Figure 2). Analysis of 224 F2 seedlings revealed a 172:52 segregation of wild type:mutant for a 3:1 ratio (calculated χ2 = 0.381 < χ20.95 = 3.841), indicating that hlb1 is recessive in a single Mendelian locus. Homozygous hlb1 plants were backcrossed at least three times with Col-0 to reduce the frequency of extraneous mutations. Figure 1.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n = 45 to 60 roots) ± se. Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Osmotic stress, salt stress, and the auxins indole-3-acetic acid and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid inhibited primary root growth in hlb1 to a similar extent as in the wild type, indicating that hlb1 is hypersensitive only to LatB and cytochalasin, compounds that directly interfere with actin polymerization (Supplemental Figure 3). The response of other mutants to genes encoding actin regulatory proteins including single mutants brk1, arp2, adf4, cpa1, cpb1, and cpb3 and quadruple mutant scar1234 (Mathur et al., 2003; Dyachok et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012, 2015; Henty-Ridilla et al., 2014) to LatB was also compared with hlb1. These mutants exhibited wild-type sensitivity to LatB. act8, a mutant of a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform, also showed wild-type sensitivity to LatB. Although act2, a mutant of another root-expressed vegetative actin isoform (Kandasamy et al., 2009), was hypersensitive to LatB, its heightened sensitivity to the chemical was not as severe as that of hlb1 (Supplemental Figure 4).Cell Division, Cell Expansion, and F-Actin Organization in hlb1 Are Hypersensitive to LatB We asked whether the increased sensitivity of hlb1 roots to LatB could be explained by inhibition of cell division, cell expansion, or both. To address this question, cortical cell length in the root elongation zone and cortical cell number in the meristem was obtained from confocal microscopy analyses of propidium iodide-stained roots 2 d after transplanting seedlings on media with or without 50 nM LatB (Supplemental Figure 5A). Both cortical cell number in the root meristem and cortical cell length in the elongation zone were reduced in LatB-treated hlb1 seedlings compared with the wild type, indicating that inhibition of both processes contributed to the hypersensitivity of the mutant to the drug (Supplemental Figures 5B to 5E). We next analyzed F-actin organization in cells of the elongation zone of wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing the live-cell F-actin reporter UBQ10pro:GFP-ABD2-GFP (Dyachok et al., 2014) transplanted to growth media with or without 50 nM LatB. Cells in the root elongation zone of both genotypes on control medium showed dense and random F-actin arrays, a feature typical of cells within this region (Figure 2A). When transplanted on LatB, wild-type cells maintained their dense network of F-actin that roughly mirrored the controls with the exception of a few fluorescent aggregates. By contrast, cells in the root elongation zone of LatB-treated hlb1 had mostly diffuse fluorescence, fewer distinct F-actin arrays, and more numerous fluorescent aggregates compared with the wild type (Figure 2A). To quantify the effect of LatB on F-actin integrity, filament density (occupancy) in cells from the elongation zone was measured using an algorithm developed earlier (Higaki et al., 2010). Whereas the wild type and hlb1 on the control medium and wild type on LatB-supplemented medium had similar occupancy values, LatB-treated hlb1 had significantly lower F-actin occupancy values, indicating that F-actin structures of hlb1 were indeed more sensitive to the chemical (Figure 2B). Figure 2. Open in a new tab F-Actin of hlb1 Roots Is More Sensitive to LatB. (A) Representative images of F-actin organization in the elongation zone of the wild type and hlb1 expressing UBQ10pro:GFP-ABD2-GFP 2 d after transplanting 3-d-old seedlings on media supplemented with the solvent control solution or 50 nM LatB.

Means (n > 50 cells) ± se. Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). hlb1 Exhibits Reduced Root Hair and Primary Root Growth in the Absence of LatB Close examination of hlb1 seedlings revealed that they had mild growth defects even when LatB was excluded from the growth medium. Primary roots of hlb1 were slightly shorter than the wild type at 3, 5, and 7 d after planting (Figures 3A and 3B). hlb1 root hairs were also shorter than those of the wild type (Figures 3C to 3E). Furthermore, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy showed that hlb1 root hairs were wider and had subtle shape distortions when compared with wild-type root hairs (Figure 3F). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Primary Roots and Root Hairs of hlb1 Are Shorter Than the Wild Type in the Absence of LatB. (A) Seven-day-old wild-type and hlb1 seedlings grown vertically on LatB-free growth medium. Bar = 5 mm. (B) Quantification of primary root length at 3, 5, and 7 d after planting on LatB-free medium. Values are means (n = 50 to 65 roots) ± se (t test, ***P < 0.0001). (C) and (D) Low magnification images of wild-type (C) and hlb1 (D) seedlings grown on LatB-free medium showing multiple root hairs. Note the shorter root hairs of hlb1 compared with the wild type. Bar = 100 μm. (E) Average root hair length of wild-type and hlb1 seedlings. Values are means (n = 86 to 120 root hairs) ± se (t test, ***P < 0.0001). (F) DIC images of single root hairs from 5-d-old seedlings of the wild type and hlb1 grown on LatB-free medium. Bar = 20 μm.As noted, distinct qualitative and quantitative differences in F-actin organization in cells of the root elongation zone were observed between wild-type and hlb1 seedlings but only when treated with 50 nM LatB (Figure 2). We therefore evaluated F-actin dynamics in root hairs, where growth differences between the wild type and hlb1 appeared to be more pronounced (Figures 3C to 3F). In wild-type seedlings, the majority of the actively elongating root hairs were characterized by a distinct enrichment of fine and dynamic meshwork of F-actin at the extreme apex (Figure 4A; Supplemental Movie 1). In hlb1 root hairs, the tip-focused fine meshwork of F-actin was not always observed, and in cases where it was present, it would often dissipate rapidly (Figure 4A; Supplemental Movie 1). Similar results were obtained with wild-type and hlb1 root hairs expressing the F-actin marker UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mGFP, which was previously reported to clearly label apical F-actin meshwork at the apex of pollen tubes and moss protonema (Vidali et al., 2009). Using a 100× oil immersion objective on the spinning-disc confocal microscope, wild-type root hairs expressing UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mGFP had distinct filamentous meshwork at the tip that would often dissipate in the tips of hlb1 root hairs (Figure 4B; Supplemental Movie 2). F-actin tip dynamics in the wild type and hlb1 were quantified from 3-min time-lapse movies of growing roots hairs by obtaining the ratio of the total time where the apical meshwork of F-actin was clearly visible to the total time elapsed (Figure 4B). This ratio provided an indication of the percentage of time that the root hair was able to maintain its tip-focused fine meshwork of F-actin as it elongated. These analyses showed that hlb1 root hairs had a significantly lower ratio value than the wild type, indicating that the mutant largely failed to maintain its tip-focused fine meshwork of F-actin (Figure 4C). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Apical F-Actin Organization Is Disrupted in hlb1 Root Hairs. (A) Fine, dynamic mesh works of F-actin at the extreme tip or subapical region of wild-type root hairs (arrows) expressing UBQ10pro:GFP-ABD2-GFP.

(B) F-actin labeled using UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mGFP in root hair tips of the wild-type and hlb1 backgrounds. Filamentous structures are distinct in the apex of wild-type root hairs (arrow). F-actin dynamics in growing root hairs was quantified by obtaining the total time where the apical F-actin gradient was visible (arrow) divided by 180 s (total elapsed time of the video) to obtain the average ratio values shown in (C). (C) Quantification of tip F-actin dynamics in growing wild-type and hlb1 root hairs. Means (n = 28 to 42 root hairs) ± se (t test, **P < 0.001).We also asked whether hlb1 mutants had any measureable differences in global F-actin dynamics when compared with the wild type. Global F-actin dynamics was quantified from time-lapse movie sequences obtained from a spinning-disc confocal microscope using the metrics of pixel difference and correlation values developed earlier (Vidali et al., 2010). For this type of analysis, we focused our imaging on cortical F-actin in root epidermal cells in the mature zone and the center of growing root hairs because cells in these areas of the root stayed within the same field of view during the entire 1-min time-lapse sequence (Supplemental Movie 3). Time-lapse data sets from epidermal cells of the root transition or elongation zone were significantly displaced as the primary root grew in the medium and therefore were not suitable for the global F-actin analysis described here. Based on changes in pixel difference and correlation coefficient decay, there were no dramatic differences in global F-actin dynamics between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure 6).Cloning of the Gene Conferring the hlb1 Phenotype Because attempts to identify the mutation responsible for the hlb1 phenotype by standard thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR were unsuccessful, we conducted map-based cloning to identify the HLB1 gene. We found that the AT5G41950 gene had a 2-bp deletion in the first exon corresponding to amino acid 63 in the hlb1 mutant (Arabidopsis Chromosome 5 Positions 16786010 and 16786011). This frameshift mutation resulted in a premature stop codon at amino acid 67, which may possibly lead to a truncated protein (Supplemental Figure 7A). To confirm whether loss of AT5G41950 corresponds to hlb1, we searched the publicly available SALK collection for T-DNA insertions in the AT5G41950 gene (Alonso et al., 2003). We genotyped the segregating progeny by PCR and identified homozygous plants for three SALK lines (SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836), which had insertions in the 8th exon, the 7th intron, and the 10th intron of AT5G41950, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7B). Seedlings of these three T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited similar hypersensitivity to LatB and root hair growth defects as hlb1, indicating that these were mutant alleles of hlb1 (Supplemental Figures 7C and 7D). The original hlb1 mutant was designated as hlb1-1, whereas SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836 were named hlb1-2, hlb1-3, and hlb1-4, respectively (Supplemental Figure 7B). The average primary root length was significantly less than that of the wild type only in hlb1-2, which had an insertion in an exon, suggesting that hlb1-3 and hlb1-4 are weaker alleles (Supplemental Figure 7D). The hlb1-1 mutant allele was used for the analyses detailed below. Further evidence showing that hlb1 is linked to AT5G41950 was obtained from functional complementation of hlb1 by expression of an HLB1-GFP fusion protein that restored the wild-type phenotype (see below).HLB1 Is a Tetratricopeptide Repeat-Containing Protein Encoded by a Single Arabidopsis Gene HLB1 encodes a 565-amino acid protein of unknown function (Figure 5A). We analyzed 141 HLB1 homologs from 79 plant species to understand their phylogenetic relationship. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by the maximum likelihood method (Le and Gascuel, 2008) using MEGA6 software (Tamura et al., 2013). Based on this analysis, HLB1 appears to be well conserved across the land plant lineage (Supplemental Figure 8). Sequence alignment of HLB1 homologs from six plant species representing moss, monocots, and eudicots showed that HLB1 has a highly variable N terminus, six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, and a well conserved C terminus predicted to form a helical structure. The conservation of amino acids at the C terminus of several plant HLB1 proteins suggests that HLB1 has functional domains that have yet to be characterized (Figure 5B). Figure 5.

Dark-green shading depicts identical amino acid residues. Light green indicates other conserved residues.Including HLB1, the Arabidopsis genome has 147 proteins containing a total of 839 TPR motifs that are predicted to function in a range of biological processes and localize to a variety of subcellular compartments (Supplemental Data Set 1). However, HLB1 has no paralogs among any of the 146 TPR motif-containing Arabidopsis proteins, indicating that it exists as a single gene. Furthermore, HLB1 is specific to land plants, as no homologous sequences were identified in fungi and animals. TPR domains mediate protein-protein interactions, and proteins containing these domains are part of protein complexes with diverse functions including transcriptional repression, protein import, heat shock, and cell cycle regulation (Blatch and Lässle, 1999; D’Andrea and Regan, 2003). TPR domain-containing proteins in plants have been implicated in responses to various hormones, assembly of the photosynthetic machinery, plastid partitioning, and root development (Jacobsen et al., 1996; Rosado et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2014; Bhuiyan et al., 2015).HLB1 Colocalizes with TGN and EE Markers through Its Conserved C-Terminal Domain HLB1 fusions to GFP under the control of the native HLB1 promoter (HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP) and the CaMV 35S promoter (35Spro:GFP-HLB1) were generated to gain more insight into HLB1 function. Both HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP and 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 complemented the LatB-hypersensitive and root hair phenotypes of hlb1-1 in young seedlings, indicating that the HLB1 fluorescent protein fusions are functional (Figures 6A and 6B; Supplemental Figure 9). Figure 6. Open in a new tab A Functional HLB1-GFP Fusion Localizes to Endomembranes. (A) and (B) HLBpro:HLB1-GFP complements the hypersensitivity to LatB and short root hair phenotypes of hlb1-1. Bars = 5 mm in (A) and 200 μm in (B). (C) and (D) HLB1-GFP decorates distinct fluorescent bodies (arrowheads) in the root elongation zone and growing root hairs. See Supplemental Movie 4 for a corresponding time-lapse sequence. (E) and (F) HLB1-GFP in the root elongation zone and root hairs form intracellular agglomerates (arrows) upon treatment with 50 μM BFA. Bars = 20 μm.Confocal microscopy of cells from the elongation zone and root hairs of hlb1-1 seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP revealed that the fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm and decorated distinct and dynamic foci (Figures 6C and 6D; Supplemental Movie 4). The fluorescent bodies decorated by HLB1-GFP were reminiscent of those observed in plant cells expressing fluorescently tagged compartments of the endomembrane system (Geldner et al., 2009). Endomembrane compartments such as endosomes visualized with GFP have been shown to form large intracellular fluorescent agglomerates when treated with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) (Robinson et al., 2008). Consistent with the hypothesis that the HLB1-GFP bodies were associated with the endomembrane system, seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP treated with 50 μM BFA for 1 h developed intracellular fluorescent agglomerates (Figures 6E and 6F). To determine the identity of the endomembrane compartment with which HLB1 is associated, HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP lines were crossed with a set of marker lines expressing mCherry and CFP endomembrane markers (Nelson et al., 2007; Geldner et al., 2009). HLB1-GFP overlapped substantially with the TGN markers mCherry-VTI12 and SYP61-CFP and an early/recycling endosomal marker, mCherry-RabA1g (Figures 7A to 7D; Supplemental Movies 5 and 6), but not with the Golgi marker Man49-mCherry. Although the bodies decorated by HLB1-GFP and Man49-mCherry were clearly distinct, many HLB1-GFP bodies were adjacent to the larger Golgi bodies and often moved alongside Golgi stacks, a feature typical of TGN dynamics (Supplemental Movie 7) (Uemura et al., 2014). A number of HLB1-GFP bodies were also observed to move independently of Man49-mCherry (Supplemental Movie 7). HLB1-GFP did not overlap substantially with mCherry-ARA6, a marker for the late endosomes/prevacuolar compartment (PVC) (Figure 7E; Supplemental Movie 8). The extent of colocalization of HLB1-GFP with selected endomembrane markers was quantified by extracting Pearson’s correlation coefficients from scatterplots of green-red image pairs (Manders et al., 1993; Costes et al., 2004; Bottanelli et al., 2012) (Figure 7F). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was higher in the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-VTI12 pair when compared with the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-RabA1g pair. The higher value for the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-VTI12 pair indicates that HLB1 foci are associated more closely with the VTI12-resident TGN/EE population and to a lesser extent with recycling endosomes decorated by RabA1g (Figure 7G). Lower Pearson’s correlation coefficients were obtained from the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-ARA6 pair, consistent with visual observations of minimal overlap between HLB1 and late endosomes/PVC (Figures 7E and 7G; Supplemental Movie 8). Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that HLB1 is a TGN/EE-localized protein. Figure 7.

(F) A representative scatterplot for quantification of the extent of colocalization between green- and red-emitting organelles. The scatterplot for colocalization was obtained from an individual cell as indicated by the white rectangle in (A). (G) Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated from scatterplots using Volocity quantitation software. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n > 170 cells) ± se. Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).As noted above, HLB1 contains six TPR motifs and a conserved C-terminal domain of unknown function. To determine whether these domains target HLB1 to the TGN/EE, we generated GFP fusions to truncated HLB1 where either the six TPR motifs (GFP-HLB1∆TPR) or the conserved C terminus (GFP-HLB1∆CTD) was deleted (Supplemental Figure 10A). When expressed in seedlings, the GFP-HLB1∆CTD fusion that had the intact TPR motifs localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. By contrast, the GFP-HLB1∆TPR with the conserved C terminus localized to both the cytoplasm and TGN/EE bodies, similar to the localization of full-length HLB1 (Supplemental Figure 10B). Taken together, the data indicate that the C terminus of HLB1 is responsible for its localization to the TGN/EE.HLB1-GFP Bodies Track along F-Actin in Planta Given that the hlb1 mutant is hypersensitive to LatB, we tested the association of HLB1-GFP TGNs with F-actin in planta. HLB1-GFP plants were crossed with plants expressing the red fluorescent F-actin construct UBQ10pro:mCherry-ABD2-mCherry (Dyachok et al., 2014). It was difficult to obtain clear images of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP bodies together in root cells that were highly cytoplasmic because the HLB1-GFP cytoplasmic component would often obscure the red F-actin label. Thus, imaging of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP was conducted on vacuolated epidermal cells of the root maturation zone and fully mature root hairs, where signal from the cytoplasm was minimal. In these cell types, HLB1-GFP bodies aligned with and tracked along F-actin bundles in a “beads-on-a-string”-like localization, typical of actin membrane adaptors such as the NET proteins, which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo (Figures 8A and 8B; Supplemental Movies 9 and 10) (Wang et al., 2014). Figure 8. Open in a new tab HLB1-GFP Tracks along F-Actin Cables in Living Cells. Root epidermal cell from the maturation zone (A) and the base of a mature root hair (B) coexpressing HLB1-GFP and mCherry-ABD2-mCherry (mCh-ABD2-mCh), an F-actin marker. Arrows indicate individual or clusters of HLB1-GFP bodies aligned along the red-emitting F-actin cables. See Supplemental Movies 9 and 10 for corresponding time-lapse sequences. Bars = 10 μm.The increased sensitivity of hlb1 to LatB prompted us to ask whether the HLB1-GFP bodies themselves responded to LatB treatment. We found that roots of seedlings formed intracellular HLB1-GFP agglomerates within 10 min of LatB application. However, other TGN markers, including YFP-VTI12 and SYP61-CFP, formed similar aggregates as HLB1-GFP after LatB treatment, indicating that the compound has a global effect on TGN distribution in root cells (Supplemental Figure 11).The Rice Ortholog of Arabidopsis HLB1 Partially Complements hlb1 Bioinformatic analyses indicated that HLB1 is a highly conserved protein that did not diverge much during the split between eudicots and monocots (Supplemental Figure 8). To test whether an HLB1 ortholog from a monocot could have similar functions as the Arabidopsis HLB1, the rice (Oryza sativa) HLB1 gene (Os-HLB1) was cloned and a 35Spro:OsHLB1-GFP construct was generated. The OsHLB1-GFP fusion partially complemented the LatB-hypersensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis hlb1 but fully complemented its short primary root defects. Furthermore, OsHLB1-GFP localized to the cytoplasm and labeled similar dynamic punctate bodies as the Arabidopsis HLB1-GFP in the hlb1-1 mutant background (Supplemental Figures 12A and 12B). The partial complementation of hlb1 by OsHLB1-GFP and similar localization patterns as the Arabidopsis HLB1 supports the conclusion that the role of HLB1 in endomembrane traffic is likely conserved in land plants.Coimmunoprecipitation Identifies HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1 as a Potential HLB1 Interactor Because TPR domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (D’Andrea and Regan, 2003), coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed to identify proteins interacting with HLB1 using roots of hlb1-1 seedlings complemented with the 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 construct (Supplemental Figure 9). Seedlings expressing 35Spro:GFP served as control plants. GFP-HLB1 and its putative interactors were coimmunoprecipitated using anti-GFP serum. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins from 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 and 35Spro:GFP seedlings were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and the components were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Peptides corresponding to both HLB1 and GFP were readily detected in the coimmunoprecipitates from the roots of the 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 line, indicating successful isolation of chimeric GFP-HLB1 from the root extracts (Figure 9A; Supplemental Data Set 2). Figure 9. Open in a new tab MIN7/BEN1 Interacts with HLB1 and ben1 Phenocopies the Hypersensitivity to LatB and Root Hair Phenotypes of hlb1. (A) Heat map of two independent co-IP experiments from roots of the GFP-only control and GFP-HLB1 seedlings indicating relative abundance of peptides. GFP peptides were detected in all the samples. HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 peptides were detected in the respective GFP-HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1-GFP samples, but not in the GFP-only controls (a value of 0 indicates absence of peptide). Note that HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 were pulled down, reciprocally. (B) Hypersensitivity of ben1 and hlb1 to LatB. Three-day-old seedlings were transplanted onto 50 nM LatB and the image was taken 6 d later. Bar = 5 mm. (C) Representative bright-field images of wild-type, hlb1, and ben1 root hairs from seedlings without LatB treatment. Bar = 20 μm. (D) MIN7/BEN1-GFP and HLB1-mCherry colocalize (arrows) in common TGN/EE compartments in root peripheral cap cells. Bar = 10 μm. (E) Pearson’s correlation coefficients were similar between MIN7/BEN1-GFP and HLB1-mCherry and HLB1-GFP and mCherry-VTI12 (t test; n.s., not significant).Two independent co-IP experiments were conducted, and proteins present in 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 immunoprecipitates but not in 35Spro:GFP controls were considered for further analyses. Surprisingly, the first co-IP experiment yielded a limited number of proteins with only 22 proteins unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1. By contrast, the second co-IP experiment yielded ∼650 proteins unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1. It is unclear why there was a large discrepancy in the protein list between two independent co-IP experiments. In both co-IP experiments, however, peptides of HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1 (MIN7/BEN1) were detected as unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 root extracts (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009). To validate the results of the two co-IP experiments, a reciprocal co-IP was conducted with root extracts of 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP (Nomura et al., 2011). Consistent with the possibility that MIN7/BEN1 interacts with HLB1, HLB1 peptides were identified in the immunoprecipitates of 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP but not in the 35Spro:GFP controls (Figure 9A). MIN7/BEN1 has been previously shown to localize to the TGN/EE and function in endocytosis of PM proteins (Tanaka et al., 2009; Nomura et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2013). Therefore, its connection to HLB1 was evaluated in more detail. Genetic and pharmacological evidence that MIN7/BEN1 is biologically relevant to HLB1 function was obtained from analyses of min7/ben1 mutants (SALK_013761), which we refer to here as ben1 for simplicity. Roots of the ben1 mutant were hypersensitive to LatB, as much as hlb1 (Figure 9B). Even in the absence of LatB, ben1 had short primary roots and root hairs, mirroring hlb1 phenotypes (Figure 9C; Supplemental Figure 13). To determine if HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 colocalized in planta, we generated an HLB1-mCherry fusion and expressed it in plants harboring MIN7/BEN1-GFP (Nomura et al., 2011). Spinning-disc confocal microscopy observations followed by quantitative colocalization analyses revealed that HLB1-mCherry bodies overlapped significantly with MIN7/BEN1-GFP foci, providing support to our co-IP results that the two proteins indeed interact in vivo (Figures 9D and 9E; Supplemental Movie 11).The ben1 and hlb1 Mutations Affect Distinct Membrane Trafficking Pathways A mutant allele of ben1 was isolated from a confocal microscopy-based forward-genetic screen for defects in the internalization of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) PM-localized auxin efflux carriers. ben1 was found to be defective in endocytic trafficking as it had diminished ability to form PIN-GFP agglomerates when treated with BFA (Tanaka et al., 2009, 2013). Because ben1 mirrored the LatB hypersensitivity and root hair phenotypes of hlb1 (Figure 9), we hypothesized that hlb1 could also have defects in the formation of intracellular PIN agglomerates when exposed to BFA. PIN2-GFP was therefore expressed in hlb1 and treated with BFA. Like wild-type roots, hlb1 roots accumulated intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates after 1 h exposure to 50 μM BFA (Figure 10A). Although the number of PIN2-GFP agglomerates per cell in hlb1 and the wild type was not statistically different, fluorescence of BFA-induced agglomerates was more intense in hlb1 compared with the wild type when imaged under similar confocal microscopy settings (Figures 10B and 10C). The stronger fluorescence intensity of PIN2-GFP agglomerates in hlb1 prompted us to ask whether the hlb1 mutation might be affecting the recycling of PIN2-GFP to the PM. To address this question, BFA washout experiments were conducted on wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP. After 1 to 2 h of BFA washout, the number of PIN2-GFP agglomerates in wild-type roots decreased significantly, whereas those in the hlb1 mutant background persisted (Figures 10A and 10C). Figure 10. Open in a new tab hlb1 Is Defective in Recycling of PIN2-GFP to the Plasma Membrane. (A) One-hour treatment with BFA results in the formation of intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates in both the wild type and hlb1.

(H) Quantification of the number of PIN2-GFP agglomerates in root cells of the wild type and hlb1 after treatment with LatB for 1 h. Values are means (n = 341 root cortical cells) ± se from at least 15 independent seedlings (t test, ***P < 0.0001).The PIN2 trafficking phenotypes observed in hlb1 were surprisingly opposite to those reported for ben1 but strikingly similar to those described for a class of dominant membrane trafficking mutants called bex (for bfa-visualized exocytic trafficking defective) (Feraru et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014). In addition to the persistence of PIN agglomerates after BFA washout, bex1 and bex5 mutants formed intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates in response to low (10 μM) concentrations of BFA, whereas the wild type showed only minor agglomerate formation (Feraru et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014). hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP were therefore treated with 10 μM BFA for 1 and 3 h to determine if hlb1 trafficking defects mirrored those reported for bex1 and bex5. Consistent with previous studies, 10 μM BFA induced only minor intracellular accumulation of PIN2-GFP in wild-type seedlings (Figure 10D). By contrast, hlb1 roots exposed to 10 μM BFA for the same time periods as the wild type showed significant formation of PIN2-GFP agglomerates that were reminiscent of the bex mutants (Figures 10D and 10E) (Feraru et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014). Taken together, the data indicate that HLB1 functions in protein recycling to the PM.Recycling of PIN2-GFP to the Plasma Membrane in hlb1 Is Hypersensitive to LatB Because hlb1 is hypersensitive to LatB and the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the intracellular trafficking of PIN proteins (Geldner et al., 2001; Nagawa et al., 2012), we hypothesized that PIN2-GFP recycling in the hlb1 background could also exhibit heightened sensitivity to concentrations of LatB that only minimally affected PIN2-GFP recycling in the wild type. To test this hypothesis, the wild type and hlb1 expressing PIN2-GFP were treated with 50 nM LatB. At this LatB concentration, PIN2-GFP in roots of the wild type formed a few, weakly fluorescing intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates within 1 h of exposure to the drug. On the other hand, roots of hlb1 seedlings formed bright and numerous PIN2-GFP intracellular agglomerates that were reminiscent of BFA-induced PIN2-GFP bodies (Figures 10F to 10H). These results indicate that the recycling of PIN2-GFP to the PM in hlb1 is more sensitive to LatB compared with the wild type and consistent with the heightened response of its roots and F-actin structures to the chemical. hlb1 Exhibits Enhanced Accumulation of PIN2-GFP at the PM and Endosomes but Has No Measurable Defects in TGN and MIN1/BEN1 Dynamics We next asked if the localization of PIN2-GFP was altered in hlb1 root cells without BFA or LatB treatment. Live-cell microscopy and corresponding quantitative analyses showed that PIN2-GFP signal in the hlb1 background was higher in the PM and in the cell interior compared with the wild type when imaged with similar confocal microscopy settings. The stronger fluorescence in the cell interior of hlb1 root cells was due to brighter and more distinct PIN2-GFP foci (Figures 11A and 11B). Figure 11. Open in a new tab PIN2-GFP Distribution, Constitutive Secretion, and Traffic to the Vacuole Are Partially Disrupted in hlb1. (A) Representative images of non-LatB-treated root cells expressing PIN2-GFP. Bar = 10 μm. (B) Quantitative analysis of PIN2-GFP fluorescence in the PM (arrows) and cell interior (white rectangle).

(G) RFP-AFVY accumulates in the vacuole (V) lumen of epidermal cells of wild-type and hlb1 hypocotyls. In hlb1, RFP-AFVY is mis-sorted to the apoplast (Ap). Bar = 20 μm. (H) Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was quantified by dividing the average fluorescence intensity of the apoplast by the average fluorescence intensity of the vacuole as indicated by the white rectangles in (G). A higher ratio indicates strong RFP-AFVY accumulation in the apoplast. Values are means (n = 38 to 43 cells from 15 independent seedlings) ± se (t test, ***P < 0.0001).The more intense PIN2-GFP signals in the PM and cell interior of hlb1 roots was reminiscent of observations made in bex5, which showed similar PIN2-GFP recycling defects as hlb1 (Feraru et al., 2012). Given the defects in PIN2-GFP recycling in hlb1, we asked whether the distribution of a TGN/EE marker was altered in the mutant. To address this question, we expressed YFP-VTI12 in the hlb1 background. The distribution of YFP-VTI12 foci in peripheral root cap cells was similar in the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure 14A). Furthermore, global analyses of YFP-VTI12 dynamics in root hairs revealed no appreciable differences between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figures 14B and 14C and Supplemental Movie 12). Because we established that MIN7/BEN1 is an HLB1 interactor at the TGN/EE, we also looked at the distribution of MIN7/BEN1-GFP in the hlb1 background. Unfortunately, lines expressing MIN7/BEN1-GFP in hlb1 and the wild type were extensively silenced and we could observe GFP signal only from cells in the peripheral root cap. Like YFP-VTI12, the distribution of MIN7/BEN1-GFP in these cells was similar between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure 14D). Although we did not detect any substantial differences between the wild type and hlb1 with regard to VTI12 or MIN7/BEN1 distribution at the light microscope level, we cannot discount the possibility that TGN/EE ultrastructure might be affected in the hlb1 mutant as has been reported in bex5 (Feraru et al., 2012). Because conspicuous differences between the wild type and hlb1 were noted with regard to PIN2-GFP intensity in the PM and cell interior (Figures 11A and 11B), we next asked if hlb1 displayed any pin2-like phenotypes in regard to seedling root development. Consistent with previous reports, pin2 seedlings had distinct root agravitropic defects as evident from their high deviation from vertical growth (Müller et al., 1998). By contrast, the deviation from vertical growth of hlb1 roots was similar to the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). Moreover, although the deviation from vertical growth of pin2 roots appeared to be enhanced by LatB, their primary roots exhibited wild-type growth sensitivity to LatB (Supplemental Figures 15C and 15D). Root deviation from vertical growth of ben1 and hlb1 ben1 was similar to hlb1 and the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). These data indicate that the HLB1-MIN7/BEN1-resident TGN complex is not required for full functionality of PIN2. Because PIN2 recycling is defective in hlb1 and post-Golgi traffic of some PIN proteins is a crucial component of the root gravitropic response (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010), we next asked whether hlb1 roots were compromised in gravitropism. Seedlings of the wild type and hlb1 with roots growing vertically were rotated by 90 degrees, and the kinetics of root curvature was monitored at various time points for a 12-h period. No measureable differences in root gravitropic response between wild-type and hlb1 seedlings under our growth conditions were noted (Supplemental Figures 15E and 15F). hlb1 Has Partial Defects in Bulk Flow Secretion and Trafficking to the Vacuole The impaired trafficking of PIN2-GFP to the PM in hlb1 could be due to defects in protein secretion or recycling. We therefore expressed the secreted (SEC)-RFP fusion, a bulk-flow secretion reporter, in hlb1 (Faso et al., 2009; Renna et al., 2013) to determine whether the mutant has defects in constitutive secretion mechanisms. We first examined SEC-RFP in actively elongating root hairs because the tips of these cell types are characterized by active secretion (Preuss et al., 2004), and the most obvious growth and F-actin organizational defects of hlb1 seedlings were observed in root hairs (Figures 3 and 4). Using spinning-disc confocal microscopy, we found that growing root hairs of the wild type had intense SEC-RFP fluorescence at the extreme tip. By contrast, most hlb1 root hairs had weak SEC-RFP fluorescence at the tip or failed to maintain a distinct tip-focused SEC-RFP gradient (Figure 11C; Supplemental Movie 13). The tip-focused SEC-RFP gradient was quantified by obtaining the ratio of the average SEC-RFP fluorescence at the tip apex to the average SEC-RFP fluorescence at the subapex from 1-min time-lapse movie sequences (Figure 11D). We found that ratio values at every 10-s time point were higher in the wild type compared with hlb1, verifying our visual observations that secretion in root hair tips of hlb1 is altered (Figure 11E). Furthermore, retention of SEC-RFP in the ER appeared to be more pronounced in hlb1 cotyledons compared with the wild type (Figure 11F). However, like in the wild type, strong SEC-RFP fluorescence was still observed in the apoplast of various cell types of hlb1 seedlings (Figure 11F; Supplemental Figures 16A to 16D). Taken together, our results indicate that bulk flow secretion in hlb1 is only partially affected, a defect that is most strongly manifested in growing root hairs, which have measurable F-actin defects. The localization of HLB1 to the TGN/EE suggests that other post-Golgi trafficking pathways such as trafficking to the vacuole might be affected in the hlb1 mutant. To address this question, we expressed RFP-AFVY, a fusion to the C-terminal of phaseolin that accumulates in the vacuole lumen (Hunter et al., 2007). Because RFP-AFVY was strongly silenced in root cells, we focused our analyses on hypocotyls and cotyledons. We found that RFP-AFVY in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells of hlb1 seedlings appeared to be mis-sorted to the apoplast (Figure 11G). Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was quantified by obtaining the ratio of fluorescence from a fixed region of the apoplast to an equivalent area within the vacuole lumen in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl (Figure 11G). The higher ratio values for hlb1 compared with the wild type support that RFP-AFVY is mis-sorted in the mutant (Figure 11H). However, RFP-AFVY still accumulated in the vacuole lumen of several cell types in hlb1 similar to the wild type, indicating that vacuolar targeting defects in the mutant are only partial (Figure 11G). Other evidence showing that trafficking to the vacuole in hlb1 is not completely compromised was obtained from incubating wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP in the dark for 12 h. Under such conditions, PIN2-GFP in the wild type was shown to accumulate in lytic vacuoles (Feraru et al., 2012). Here, we observed that both the wild type and hlb1 accumulated PIN2-GFP in lytic vacuoles in the dark (Supplemental Figure 16E). In addition, the styryl dye FM1-43 labeled the tonoplast in elongating root cells of light-grown hlb1 seedlings, indicating that trafficking to the vacuole can still proceed in the mutant. FM1-43 labeling of root cells in the elongation zone and DIC microscopy of peripheral root cap cells also did not reveal dramatic differences in vacuolar morphology between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figures 16F and 16G). However, the possibility that there are subtle differences in vacuolar dynamics and morphology between the wild type and hlb1 cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, differences in vacuole morphology between the wild type and hlb1 could be more apparent in other cell types or amplified under certain growth conditions (e.g., light versus dark).Genetic Interaction Studies Indicate that hlb1 and ben1 Function in Common Root Developmental Pathways despite Opposite Effects on Membrane Trafficking As noted above, it was previously shown that ben1 had reduced intracellular accumulation of PIN-GFP following treatment with 50 μM BFA, a phenotype opposite to that of hlb1 (Tanaka et al., 2009, 2013). The opposite trafficking phenotypes of ben1 and hlb1 were surprising given their similar root developmental phenotypes and LatB hypersensitivity (Figure 9). To better understand the genetic relationship between hlb1 and ben1, hlb1 ben1 double mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants. The extent of hypersensitivity of hlb1 ben1 double mutants to LatB was similar to single hlb1 and ben1 mutants (Supplemental Figure 13A). Furthermore, root hair length of hlb1 ben1 in the absence of LatB was slightly shorter than hlb1 single mutants but similar to ben1 single mutants. In addition, hlb1 ben1 had slightly shorter primary roots in LatB-free media compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants (Supplemental Figures 13B to 13D). We next asked how trafficking of PM markers is affected in hlb1 ben1 double mutants compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants. For these assays, we used the endocytic styryl tracer dye FM1-43. Consistent with the PIN2-GFP assays, FM1-43 in the wild type and hlb1 formed fluorescent agglomerates after a 1-h treatment with 50 μM BFA (Figures 12A and 12B). Also in agreement with the PIN2-GFP assays was the observation that FM1-43 agglomerates persisted in hlb1 compared with the wild type after BFA washout (Supplemental Figure 17). By contrast, ben1 had diminished accumulation of FM1-43 agglomerates after BFA treatment, in agreement with previous reports (Figure 12C) (Tanaka et al., 2009, 2013). In hlb1 ben1, FM1-43 accumulation was diminished to a similar extent as ben1 single mutants (Figures 12D and 12E). The similar LatB-hypersensitive response and root growth defects of hlb1 ben1 to single hlb1 and ben1 mutants indicate that hlb1 and ben1 function in common genetic pathways. Because hlb1 ben1 trafficking and root hair defects mirrored those of the ben1 single mutant, ben1 likely functions upstream of hlb1. Figure 12. Open in a new tab HLB1 Acts Downstream of BEN1. (A) to (D) Intracellular accumulation of the styryl dye FM 1-43 is altered in ben1 and hlb1 ben1 but not in the wild type or hlb1.

(E) Quantification of FM1-43 agglomerates in root cells after treatment with BFA for 1 h. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Values are means (n > 200 cells) ± se from at least 20 independent seedlings. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05; Tukey’s test). (F) Growth of ben1 and hlb1 ben1 seedlings is more sensitive to 5 μM BFA compared with the wild type and hlb1. Bar = 5 mm. (G) Quantification of primary root growth (expressed as percent of controls) of the wild type, hlb1, ben1, and hlb1 ben1 in 5 μM BFA. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Values are means (n = 18 to 32 roots) ± se. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05; Tukey’s test).Another phenotype reported for ben1 seedlings is their hypersensitivity to growth on moderate concentrations of BFA (Tanaka et al., 2009). Given that both ben1 and hlb1 phenocopied each other in regard to root development and hypersensitivity to LatB, the response of hlb1 to BFA was examined. Consistent with previous reports, ben1 seedlings displayed heightened sensitivity to low doses of BFA compared with the wild type. By contrast, hlb1 seedlings showed wild-type sensitivity to BFA. Furthermore, seedlings of the hlb1 ben1 double mutant displayed similar hypersensitivity to BFA compared to seedlings of ben1 single mutants, providing additional genetic evidence that ben1 functions upstream of hlb1 (Figures 12F and 12G).DISCUSSION The endomembrane system is essential for normal plant cell development, yet many protein components that modulate its function remain to be identified. The distinct effects of cytoskeleton-disrupting chemicals on plant growth provide the basis for convenient forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants with altered sensitivity to these compounds. However, such screens have rarely been applied for studies on the plant cytoskeleton despite their strong potential to uncover mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal basis of plant development. Forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants that respond differentially to cytoskeleton-disrupting compounds have been limited to those that alter microtubules (Naoi and Hashimoto, 2004; Paredez et al., 2008). Here, we used a forward-genetic approach with the potent actin-disrupting compound LatB and identified the recessive mutant hlb1, which displayed enhanced LatB sensitivity compared with the wild type. We determined that HLB1 encodes a six TPR motif-containing protein with a conserved C-terminal domain. We found that HLB1 is a plant-specific protein that could potentially link the actin cytoskeleton with post-Golgi traffic. Loss of function of HLB1 leads to alterations in protein recycling to the PM and to an F-actin network that is more susceptible to actin-specific chemical antagonists. This, in turn, results in seedlings with root hair polarity defects and reduced primary root growth. We demonstrated that HLB1 associates with the TGN/EE through its conserved C-terminal domain and functions with the TGN/EE-localized ARF-GEF protein MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009) in overlapping endomembrane trafficking pathways. These data provide important insight into a previously undescribed component of the endomembrane trafficking machinery that is highly conserved and unique to land plants. HLB1 Is a Component of the Plant Post-Golgi Trafficking Machinery Our work experimentally demonstrates that a TPR domain protein, namely, HLB1, is localized to post-Golgi compartments. Other TPR domain-containing proteins among the 147 in Arabidopsis, including SHORT AND SWOLLEN ROOT1 and MET1, localize to mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively, consistent with their functions in oxidative stress-mediated root development and in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (Bhuiyan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). The TPR protein CLUMPED CHLOROPLAST1 (CLMP1) localizes to distinct foci in the cytoplasm. Although the exact identity of the CLMP1 foci remains unknown, their adjacent location to chloroplasts supports their role in plastid partitioning and distribution (Yang et al., 2011). Here, we show that the TGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein functions in the recycling of proteins and other lipophilic cargo from post-Golgi compartments to the PM after their uptake by endocytosis. This conclusion is supported by the observation that BFA-induced PIN2-GFP and FM1-43 agglomerates persisted in hlb1 mutants after BFA washout. hlb1 also had partial defects in constitutive secretion, which were most apparent in cells of young seedlings including root hairs and epidermal pavement cells of cotyledons. In this regard, LatB treatment was previously shown to alter the tip localization of the TGN-localized secretory marker YFP-RabA4B in growing root hairs (Preuss et al., 2004). The disrupted gradient of F-actin meshwork in hlb1 root hairs could explain the tip secretion and root hair growth defects of the mutant. The mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY to the apoplast of hlb1 is reminiscent of another post-Golgi trafficking mutant called unhinged-1, which is disrupted in a gene encoding VASCULAR SORTING PROTEIN51 (Pahari et al., 2014). Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was only partial as the marker still accumulated to a large extent in the vacuole lumen of hlb1. The RFP-AFVY assays were verified by observations that PIN2-GFP accumulated in lytic vacuoles when incubated in the dark and that FM1-43 decorated the tonoplast in hlb1. Future studies will determine whether other markers of vacuolar targeting and morphology are altered in hlb1. In animals, some TPR domain proteins localize to the endomembrane system. For instance, the endosome-localized sorting nexins SNX20 and SNX21 contain TPR motifs in addition to their phox homology (PX) phosphoinositide binding domain. These sorting nexins have been proposed to function as membrane-associated scaffolding proteins that could potentially interact with transmembrane ligands for transport through the endomembrane system (Clairfeuille et al., 2015). In addition to the TPR motifs, HLB1 contains a C-terminal domain that is highly conserved among land plants. Protein domain prediction software indicates that this C-terminal domain can form a helical structure and manual annotation revealed that it had weak similarity (∼15%) to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Arabidopsis PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOG1. Like PX domains, PH domains bind to phosphoinositides and could facilitate targeting of proteins containing these domains to membranes (Boss and Im, 2012). Consistent with the possibility that the C-terminal domain of HLB1 has similar functions to canonical PX or PH domains, we showed through GFP-HLB1 deletion constructs that HLB1 localized to TGN/EE compartments primarily through its C-terminal domain. Although direct binding of the HLB1 to lipids has yet to be demonstrated, the root hair defects of hlb1 suggest that the HLB1 C-terminal domain could provide a mechanism for integrating phosphoinositide signaling with actin-mediated tip growth regulation. In this regard, phosphoinositides have been implicated in actin-mediated root hair tip growth (Vincent et al., 2005; Yoo et al., 2012) and mutants disrupted in various steps of phosphoinositide metabolism have altered root hair development (Kusano et al., 2008; Stenzel et al., 2008; Thole et al., 2008) that mirrors the root hair phenotypes of hlb1. One explanation for the root hair defects of the hlb1 mutant is that HLB1 functions in recycling of phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes or phosphoinositides to the PM of the root hair apex. Future studies will test this hypothesis using fluorescently tagged phosphoinositide reporters and enzymes. The trafficking defects of hlb1 were similar to the previously characterized dominant bex1 and bex5 mutants (Feraru et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014). In this regard, we speculate that BEX1, an ARF1A1C small GTPase, and BEX5, a RABA1b small GTPase, could functionally converge onto similar trafficking pathways mediated by HLB1. It is important to note, however, that despite the similarities in membrane trafficking phenotypes of hlb1 to those of the bex mutants, they differed in their seedling sensitivity to BFA. Whereas bex1 and bex5 seedling growth was reported to be hypersensitive to moderate BFA concentrations (Feraru et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2014), hlb1 seedlings showed wild-type BFA sensitivity. T-DNA knockout bex5 mutants did not show the trafficking defects characteristic of the dominant-negative bex5-1, suggesting functional redundancy with other closely related RABA1b GTPases (Feraru et al., 2012). In the future, it will be interesting to test how bex loss-of-function mutants respond to LatB and to determine whether ARF1A1C and RABA1b operate in common exocytic trafficking pathways as HLB1. Although HLB1 is encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene and the hlb1 mutant showed clear defects in exocytosis and heightened sensitivity to LatB, the mild root phenotypes of hlb1 in the absence of LatB suggests that HLB1 could function redundantly with other unknown nonhomologous proteins in plant development. A significant finding from our study is the identification of MIN7/BEN1, a TGN/EE-localized ARF-GEF protein belonging to the BIG subfamily (Nomura et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2009), as an HLB1 interactor. Although the nature of the HLB1-MIN7/BEN1 interaction at the biochemical level has yet to be established, results presented here point to HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 operating in converging endomembrane trafficking pathways. In addition to the clear colocalization of HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 in distinct TGN/EE foci, double mutant studies demonstrate that ben1 is epistatic to hlb1 with regard to LatB hypersensitivity, FM1-43 recycling, root hair growth, and sensitivity to moderate concentrations of BFA. Because the hlb1 ben1 double mutant most closely resembles the phenotypes of the ben1 single mutant, MIN7/BEN1 likely functions upstream of HLB1. This observation reinforces the conclusion that the hlb1 mutant is deficient specifically in endocytic membrane recycling. The epistatic effect of ben1 on hlb1 with respect to the formation of FM1-43 BFA bodies suggests that in hlb1, the pool of PM-derived cargo for TGN-regulated recycling likely originates from endocytic uptake mediated by BEN1.HLB1 Potentially Links Post-Golgi Traffic to the Actin Cytoskeleton in Plants In addition to the root hair tip growth defects and strong hypersensitivity of hlb1 seedlings to LatB, our results support the possibility that HLB1 may exert its functions in endomembrane traffic through actin. This is supported by several lines of evidence. First, confocal microscopy analyses showed that the HLB1-GFP bodies tracked along F-actin bundles in vivo. HLB1-GFP localization was reminiscent of the “beads-on-a-string” pattern exhibited by the NET family of actin membrane adaptors (Wang et al., 2014). Second, the localization of the HLB1-GFP foci was rapidly disrupted by low doses of LatB. Third, PIN2-GFP recycling to the PM, which was only minimally affected by low doses of LatB in the wild type, was severely inhibited in hlb1. The LatB-induced PIN2-GFP agglomerates were strikingly similar to those induced by high concentrations of BFA. Despite these results, we cannot discard the possibility that the movement of HLB1-GFP punctae along F-actin could simply reflect that HLB1 is on the TGN/EE surface, which would not support specific functional linkage between actin and HLB1. Furthermore, we have found that LatB also rapidly affected the distribution of other TGN/EE markers in root cells, indicating that the observed effects of the drug on HLB1 localization are not exclusive for this protein. Nonetheless, we showed that actin dynamics in the tip of elongating root hairs are disrupted in hlb1 in support of the notion that HLB1 could be linked to actin function. The lack of differences in F-actin organization and dynamics in cells of the root elongation zone between non-LatB-treated wild type and hlb1 does not preclude the possibility that subtle differences in F-actin dynamics exist between the wild type and hlb1, and such differences may manifest only at the level of single actin filaments (Staiger et al., 2009). While a direct interaction between HLB1 with actin awaits for experimental validation, our analyses support that HLB1 exerts a role in post-Golgi membrane traffic in relation to the actin cytoskeleton, which may occur either directly or through interactions with actin modulators. The involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis and protein recycling has been documented in plants using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. For example, sterol endocytosis was found to be disrupted in act2 mutants and by treating wild-type plants with cytochalasin D (Grebe et al., 2003). LatB and cytochalasin were also shown to influence the recycling and polar localization of PIN proteins in root and leaf epidermal cells (Geldner et al., 2001; Nagawa et al., 2012). Finally, LatB was reported to interfere with protein traffic to the vacuole in protoplasts and intact roots (Kim et al., 2005). It is important to note, however, that in the aforementioned studies, high micromolar concentrations of LatB were used to trigger the reported effects on protein trafficking. The fact that hlb1 displayed strong protein trafficking and seedling growth defects in response to low nanomolar doses of LatB supports the hypothesis that HLB1 is a crucial component of post-Golgi traffic that is strongly dependent on the maintenance of an intact actin cytoskeleton. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the observation that heightened sensitivity to LatB was more pronounced in hlb1 and ben1 mutants compared with mutants with lesions in genes encoding actin itself (e.g., act2 and act8) or mutants to a suite of other actin regulatory proteins, most of which were not LatB hypersensitive. In this regard, another possible explanation for the hypersensitivity of hlb1 mutants to LatB is that loss of function of HLB1 causes mild recycling defects of several proteins directly involved in actin function particularly those that localized to the PM. The collective recycling defects of several PM-localized actin regulatory proteins, although mild, could sensitize hlb1 to even low doses of actin antagonists. Despite the recycling defects of PIN2-GFP in the hlb1 background, hlb1 did not exhibit the agravitropic phenotype characteristic of pin2 mutants and were not compromised in root gravitropism when reoriented by 90 degrees. The absence of any measurable pin2-like phenotypes in hlb1, ben1, and hlb1 ben1 double mutants supports that the protein recycling defects resulting from loss of HLB1 and BEN1 function may not be sufficient to completely alter certain PIN2-mediated seedling root growth processes. This observation further reinforces the hypothesis that HLB1 and BEN1 function redundantly with other yet to be identified TGN/EE-localized proteins in cargo recycling. The possibility that HLB1 has redundant functions with other nonhomologous proteins can also be inferred from the lack of global defects in VTI12 and MIN7/BEN1 distribution in the hlb1 mutant. Alternatively, MIN7/BEN1 could recruit HLB1 to the TGN/EE explaining the lack of any dramatic differences in MIN7/BEN1-GFP distribution between the wild type and hlb1. By contrast, root gravitropism has been shown to be driven by differential degradation of PIN2 in the vacuole of cells in the elongation zone and PIN3 relocalization to the bottom side of the columella cell PM (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008, 2010). The lack of root gravitropism defects in hlb1 is consistent with the observation that loss of HLB1 function has only mild effects on vacuolar trafficking and suggests that HLB1-mediated PIN2 recycling to the PM has minimal contributions to root gravitropic responses. The normal root gravity response of hlb1 also indicates that unlike PIN2, recycling of PIN3 and possibly other PIN proteins is independent of HLB1 function. However, additional experiments are needed to determine whether the trafficking of other PIN or PM-localized proteins is affected in the hlb1 mutant. In summary, a forward-genetic screen for altered sensitivity to the actin-disrupting drug LatB led to the discovery of a previously uncharacterized protein involved in endomembrane trafficking in plants. The TPR domain-containing HLB1 protein, which is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis, functions in protein recycling to the PM but could also contribute to constitutive secretion and trafficking to the vacuole in specific cell types. The shared phenotypes of hlb1 with other exocytic and endocytic trafficking mutants such as ben1, bex1, and bex5 indicate that the TGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein lies at a crucial step where exocytic and endocytic pathways converge and therefore represent a class of plant-specific membrane scaffolding proteins likely involved in linking post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton.METHODS Forward-Genetic Screening and Mapping of hlb1 An Arabidopsis thaliana activation-tagged T-DNA seed stock (CS31100) from the ABRC was sterilized in 95% ethanol and 20% bleach according to Dyachok et al. (2009). Sterilized seeds were suspended in an autoclaved solution of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (pH 5.7), 100 nM LatB (Calbiochem-EMD Chemicals), and 0.5% agar (Sigma-Aldrich) after the solution had cooled to 55°C. The seed suspension was gently swirled in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask to disperse the seeds uniformly and poured into 10 × 10-cm square Petri plates before the agar solidified. Petri dishes were left at 4°C for 2 d and transferred to a growth chamber with 120 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity supplied with fluorescent bulbs and set to a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle. Temperature in the chamber was maintained at 23°C while keeping plates in a vertical position. After 5 to 6 d, seedlings with severely inhibited primary root growth were selected. Primary root growth of the progeny of selected seedlings was compared with the wild type on a range of LatB concentrations. Homozygous hlb1 (Col-0 ecotype) was crossed to the Landsberg erecta ecotype, and F2 seedlings were selected based on their enhanced sensitivity to 50 nM LatB. Simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers were used to map hlb1 to a 60-kb region on the lower arm of chromosome 5 (Lukowitz et al., 2000). DNA was extracted from root tissue of 2-week-old hlb1 seedlings by grinding in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle followed by mixing with an equal volume of Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform. After precipitation with ethanol, DNA was washed multiple times and then dissolved in 50 μL water. Full-length genomic DNA of various genes in the 60-kb region was sequenced and compared with the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10) until the 2-bp deletion was found in AT5G41950. Three SALK lines with predicted insertions in AT5G41950 (SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836) were obtained from ABRC and genotyped to ensure homozygosity using the following primers: SALK_046760LP (5′-TTGCTGGAGGAAGCTTGTAAG-3′), SALK_046760RP (5′-TGGCTGTATAACTCACCAGGG-3′), SALK_065836LP (5′-TTCCCTCTCGCATAAATTGTG-3′), SALK_065836RP (5′-TCAGGTTGCAATTTGATTTCC-3′), and LBb1.3 (5′-ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC-3′). The primer pair used for SALK_144501 was the same as SALK_046760. One SALK line (SALK_013761) with a predicted exon insertion in AT3G43300 (MIN7/BEN1) was obtained from ABRC. Homozygous ben1 mutants were isolated using the following primers: SALK_013761LP (5′-TGGAAAGTGAAATTGGTGAGC-3′), SALK_013761RP (5′-CAAGGATTCTTCTCTGCATGG-3′), and LBb1.3.Chemical Treatments and Seedling Growth Assays Working solutions of LatB (Calbiochem), BFA (Sigma-Aldrich), cytochalasin B and D (MP Biomedicals), indole-3-acetic acid, and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted from stock solutions in DMSO. Working solutions of sodium chloride and mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared directly from solids from the manufacturer’s containers. Seedling growth assays were conducted by transplanting 3- to 4-d-old seedlings grown on solid (1% agar) onto MS medium supplemented with the various chemicals. Seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 to 7 d after transplanting in a 14-h-light (120 μmol m−2 s−1) and 10-h-dark cycle or in complete darkness in a growth chamber set to 23°C. In another set of experiments, 4-d-old seedlings with straight primary roots were transplanted on new Petri plates with MS medium. After 1 h of vertical growth, plates were reoriented by 90 degrees and primary roots were photographed every hour for 12 h. Images of seedlings were captured using a DXM1200C digital camera (Nikon) mounted on a copy stand or an SZX12 stereomicroscope (Olympus). Hypocotyl, primary root and root hair lengths, and root curvature were measured using the Image J v1.49 software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The 3- to 4-d-old wild-type (Col-0 ecotype) and hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP or HLB1-GFP were incubated on BFA or LatB diluted with MS medium on welled plates for various time periods and mounted on glass slides prior to imaging with a Leica TCS AOBS confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica Microsystems). For endocytic assays, a working solution of 4 μM FM1-43 (Invitrogen) was prepared in MS medium from a 10 mM aqueous solution. After incubating for 30 min in liquid MS medium, 3- to 4-d-old seedlings were pulse labeled with FM1-43 for 5 min at room temperature. Seedlings were then treated with 50 μM BFA for 1 h prior to confocal imaging. In a separate set of seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP or pulse-labeled with FM1-43, BFA was washed out by transferring seedlings to liquid MS medium prior to imaging.Generation of HLB1-Green Fluorescent Protein Constructs The HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP construct was generated from full-length HLB1 gDNA extracted from roots of 2-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Full-length HLB1 gDNA including ∼400 bp immediately preceding the start codon (3319 bp total) was amplified using the following primers: HLBpro-F-XmaI (5′-CATCCCGGGGACTACTTATATCTTTCACTCTTGTTC-3′) and HLBpro-R-XmaI (5′-TACCCCGGGCACCGGTGATAATACCGGCTA-3′). The product was cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector as described (Wang et al., 2008). 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 was generated from full-length HLB1 cDNA (1698 bp) amplified using the following primers: HLB-F-NcoI (5′-CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG-3′) and HLB-R-SpeI (5′- CATACTAGTTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC-3′). The resulting product was digested with NcoI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector behind the CaMV 35S promoter driving expression of GFP (Wang et al., 2008). To generate the GFP-HLB1∆CTD fusion, a truncated HLB1 cDNA fragment, from position 1 to 1482 bp, was amplified using the primers HLB1-F-NcoI and HLB1∆CTD-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTTTATACCGTCTTCCTCTCCACGT-3′), and the resulting product was digested with NcoI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Similarly, the GFP-HLB1∆TPR fusion was created by first amplifying HLB1 cDNA from position 1 to 609 bp with the following primers: HLB1∆TPR-F-NcoI (5′-CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG-3′) and HLB1∆TPR-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTACGTTGGCGAGATCGACC-3′). This fragment was digested with NcoI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector to created HLB11-609. Next, an HLB1 cDNA fragment was amplified from position 1276 to 1698 bp with the following primers: HLB1∆TPR(2)-F-SpeI (5′-CATACTAGTCTACCTCTCCCGCATCTTAAAGT-3′) and HLB1∆TPR(2)-R-PmlI (5′-TACCACGTGTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC-3′). This fragment was digested with SpeI and PmlI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the HLB11-609 construct. The 35Spro:OsHLB1-GFP construct was generated by amplifying full-length OsHLB1 cDNA (1449 bp) with the primers OsHLB1-F-SalI (5′-CATGTCGACATGGAGGATTCTGCGCGG-3′) and OsHLB1-R-EcoRI (5′-GTAGAATTCACCAGTAATGATACCTGCCAATACA-3′). The product was digested with SalI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and again cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Constructs were introduced into hlb1-1 via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).Confocal Microscopy and Colocalization Studies hlb1-1 seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP were crossed with various red- or cyan-emitting marker lines. The PIN2-GFP, Man49-mCherry, SYP61-CFP, mCherry-VTI12, mCherry-RabA1g, mCherry-Ara6, GFP-ABD2-GFP, mCherry-ABD2-mCherry, MIN7/BEN1-GFP, RFP-AFVY, and SEC-RFP lines were described previously (Nelson et al., 2007; Robert et al., 2008; Geldner et al., 2009; Nomura et al., 2011; Feraru et al., 2012; Renna et al., 2013; Dyachok et al., 2014). To generate the UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mEGFP construct, mEGFP with the 51-bp Lifeact sequence directly upstream was amplified from plasmid DNA described by Vidali et al. (2009) using the following primers: Lifeact-F-EcoRI (5′-CATGAATTCATGGGTGTCGCAGATTTGATC-3′) and Lifeact-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′). The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned behind the UBQ10 promoter in a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Five-day-old seedlings coexpressing HLB1-GFP and various red- or cyan-emitting markers were imaged with a Leica confocal microscope or Perkin-Elmer UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope. For quantification of F-actin and TGN/EE dynamics, images of epidermal cells in the root maturation zone or root hairs growing along the bottom of 48 × 64-mm cover slips coated with MS medium in 0.5% agar were captured every 0.5 to 1 s for 1 to 3 min with a Perkin-Elmer spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 63× water or a 100× oil immersion objective.Image Analysis Percentage of occupancy of F-actin was determined using the algorithm described by Higaki et al. (2010). Prior to applying the Higaki algorithm, single cells from the root elongation zone were converted into binary images and filaments skeletonized by software that was developed using MATLAB R2013a (The Mathworks Inc.) as described (Dyachok et al., 2014). Intensity of BFA agglomerates was obtained using custom software written in MATLAB 8.5. The original images from the confocal microscope were first converted to gray scale and separated into 48 layers by intensity values from zero to maximum (255*255), and a binary image was created. The circle Hough Transform method was used to trace areas occupied by BFA- and LatB-induced PIN2-GFP or FM1-43 agglomerates in the binary images. The average intensity in grayscale images in each of marked agglomerate was calculated. From the same set of images used to calculate agglomerate fluorescence intensity, the number of agglomerates per cell was manually counted. Quantification and statistical analyses of global F-actin and YFP-VTI12 dynamics were conducted following the methods of Vidali et al. (2010) and Dyachok et al. (2014) using images of root epidermal cells and root hairs from at least 15 time-lapse movie sequences. To adopt the method used for global analysis of F-actin to dynamics of YFP-VTI12 foci in root hairs, we first created an algorithm that utilized the Hough Transform method to detect individual organelles from binary images obtained from time-lapse movies. This algorithm allowed us to set a threshold so that fluorescence originating from the cytoplasm was excluded from our analysis. To quantify fluorescence in the PM and cell interior of PIN2-GFP-expressing root cells, we created another algorithm. After converting images to gray scale, binary images were generated after separating the image into 48 layers and classifying the layers based on their intensity values. This allowed us to separate fluorescence of the PM from the cell interior where the white area in the binary image corresponded to PM signals and the black area corresponded to the cell interior. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by accumulating the intensity value of each pixel from the PM and cell interior. To quantify the extent of colocalization between HLB1-GFP and other mCherry-tagged TGN/EE markers, spinning-disc confocal images were first thresholded using the Volocity quantitation software (Perkin-Elmer). The colocalization function of Volocity allows automated thresholding and statistical analyses of red and green channels according to the methods of Manders et al. (1993) and Costes et al. (2004). From the colocalization menu of Volocity quantitation, a region of interest representing a single cell (Figure 7A) was selected, and from generated scatterplots (Figure 7F) (Bottanelli et al., 2012), Pearson’s correlation coefficient values were calculated.Phylogenetic Analysis and Bioinformatics To deduce phylogeny of HLB1, sequences for 141 homologous proteins from 79 species were obtained from GenBank. The amino acid sequences were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004), and unreliable sequences with confidence score lower than 0.6 were removed (Penn et al., 2010). The alignment is available as Supplemental Data Set 3. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) based on the maximum likelihood method (Le and Gascuel, 2008). A matrix of pairwise distances was estimated by the JTT model, and the tree with the highest log likelihood (12,977) was chosen with the Neighbor-join and BIONJ algorithm. A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G, parameter = 3.2081). All positions with <95% site coverage were eliminated. To find TPR-containing proteins, the Arabidopsis genome was scanned with TPRpred (Karpenahalli et al., 2007). The resulting 587 proteins were compared against the Conserved Domain Database (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015). The 147 Arabidopsis proteins were identified to have more than one TPR motifs. Predicated subcellular localization for the TPR proteins was obtained from the SubCellular Proteome Database and presented in Supplemental Data Set 1.Co-IP Co-IP experiments were conducted using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, proteins were extracted by grinding roots of 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings expressing 35Spro:GFP, 35Spro:GFP-HLB, and 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP in liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was then mixed with extraction/wash solution supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) by vortexing. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was mixed with control resin via end-over-end shaking in a 15-mL Falcon tube for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was then added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. Rabbit Anti-GFP Monoclonal Antibody (ABCAM catalog number1218, lot number GR181836-3) was added to the cleared protein lysate and mixed by end-over-end shaking overnight at 4°C. Protein A/G plus agarose resin was then added and allowed to mix for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was again added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction/wash solution and then one time with 1× conditioning buffer. The proteins were eluted by adding 2× nonreducing lane marker sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and heating for 10 min at 100°C. Once cooled, the columns were placed inside Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. Composition of the eluent was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Bioproximity). Briefly, the samples were digested with trypsin (10 μg/mL) overnight at 37°C. The resulting peptides were dried and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were resolved with Thermo Easy-nLC1000 column (C18 reverse phase, 50 cm, ϕ 75 μm), ionized with Thermo Easy Spray, and then analyzed with a Thermo Q-exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The spectra were assigned to peptides using the OMSSA (Geer et al., 2004), X!Tandem (Craig and Beavis, 2004), and X!Hunter (Craig et al., 2006) algorithms.Accession Numbers Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/ EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: HLB1 (AT5G41950) and MIN7/BEN1 (AT3G43300).

All rights reserved.  Copyright notice ID: 6048781 PMID: 29802213 Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical projections that expand the effective radius of the root. In doing so, they play crucial roles in the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, especially under conditions in which such resources are limiting (Carminati et al., 2017). Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism (Cole and Fowler, 2006; Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013). In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known as Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls; Franck et al., 2018), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2017; Schoenaers et al., 2018). In one noteworthy study, Bai et al. (2014) reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca2+]cyt-associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family (Haruta et al., 2014). In Arabidopsis thaliana, cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth (Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Schoenaers et al., 2018). Bai et al. (2014) proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH4+ environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH4+. Sensing of cytoplasmic NH4+ by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH4+ sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH4+ accumulate in the cytoplasm of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, their root hairs cease to expand (Bai et al., 2014). In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH4+ homeostasis based on our studies of a new eru-3 mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. This is further supported by recent work on the eru-2 mutant by Schoenaers et al. (2018), as described below. CAP1/ERU IS A PM-LOCALIZED PROTEIN A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH4+ homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH4+, resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole (Bai et al., 2014). We independently isolated the recessive eru-3 mutant in a forward-genetic screen for root hair mutants that resembled wild-type root hairs treated with low concentrations of the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B. Here, we refer to our mutant as eru-3 following the nomenclature of Haruta et al. (2014), in which two mutant alleles of eru were first described as eru-1 and eru-2. The cap1 mutant (SALK_083442) studied by Bai et al. (2014) is similar to eru-2; therefore, we refer to it here as cap1/eru-2 (Figure 1A). When we expressed an ERU-GFP construct under the control of the constitutive UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter (UBQ10:ERU-GFP) in the eru-3 mutants, their root hairs were restored to wild-type lengths, indicating that the fusion protein was functional (Figures 1B and 1C). Figure 1. Open in a new tab A Functional ERU-GFP Fusion Localizes to the PM and Post-Golgi/Endocytic Vesicles at the Root Hair Tip. (A) Schematic diagram of the domain organization of the ERU protein. Relative positions of T-DNA insertions of eru-1, cap1/eru-2, and eru-3 are indicated as vertical lines. (B) and (C) UBQ10:ERU-GFP complements the short root hair phenotypes of eru-3. Statistical significance for root hair length was determined by one-way ANOVA.

(D) Localization of ERU-GFP in root hairs at various stages of development. pm, PM; v, vacuole; t, tonoplast. In addition to the PM, ERU-GFP marks distinct puncta (arrowheads) in root hairs undergoing rapid tip growth. Bars = 10 μm. (E) Double y axis graph showing that fluorescence of ERU-GFP intensifies as root hairs transition to rapid tip growth. Relative fluorescence and root hair length were measured every 10 min. Mean ± se (n = 4 root hairs from four independent 4-d-old seedlings). (F) Scatterplot showing that fluorescence of ERU-GFP is positively correlated with growth rate of root hairs (P < 2.2 × 10−6). The same data were plotted in (E) and (F). See detailed methods in supplemental data.We found that instead of localizing to the root hair tonoplast, ERU-GFP marked the PM at the site of root hair bulges. As root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth, the ERU-GFP signal intensified and formed a diffuse fluorescent cap at the root hair apex (Figure 1D). Distal to the root hair tip, ERU-GFP decorated distinct and dynamic puncta that were reminiscent of post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles (Figure 1D). As root hairs matured and ceased growth, the intensity of ERU-GFP at the tip declined (Figure 1D). Time-course and correlation analyses revealed that tip-directed accumulation of ERU-GFP was most intense in root hairs that grew rapidly (Figures 1E and 1F), supporting the role of ERU as a positive regulator of root hair tip growth. It is important to note that Bai et al. (2014) used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs. It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in the eru-3 mutant under the control of the native ERU promoter (ERUpro) consisting of 626 bp upstream of the ERU gene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recover ERUpro:ERU-GFP lines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included the ERU promoter coupled to the ERU coding and GFP sequence (ERUp:ERU-GFP) complemented cap1/eru-2 root hairs (Schoenaers et al., 2018). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides.CAP1/ERU FUNCTION IS LINKED TO CYTOPLASMIC CALCIUM OSCILLATIONS Another major result of Bai et al. (2014) that we address in this letter is their finding that root hairs of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants appeared to lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients. We feel that it is important to address these results because they provide an example of how [Ca2+]cyt imaging data on root hairs can be misinterpreted. For these experiments, it is critical to note that root hair growth ceases when the large central vacuole protrudes toward the cell apex (Grierson et al., 2014). Furthermore, mature, nongrowing root hairs in which the vacuole protrudes to the apex have been shown to lack [Ca2+]cyt gradients (Wymer et al., 1997). The images of cap1/eru-2 root hairs that Bai et al. (2014) presented as the basis for extracting their [Ca2+]cyt data (Figures 2A and 3C in Bai et al. [2014]) clearly showed the vacuole protruding to the apex. Based on the above observations, we would not expect to find [Ca2+]cyt gradients in such root hairs. We expressed the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter G-CAMP3 (Tian et al., 2009) in eru-3 to assess if their root hairs lacked a [Ca2+]cyt gradient. We were careful to sample [Ca2+]cyt only in root hairs that had a dense cytoplasm at the cell apex. In contrast to the results of Bai et al. (2014), we found that eru-3 root hairs that still had a substantial cytoplasm at the apex did not lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients. These eru-3 root hairs were still elongating, albeit at a significantly reduced rate when compared with the wild type (∼0.20 μm/min for eru-3 versus 1 μm/min for the wild type). However, we did observe that patterns of tip [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in these slow growing eru-3 root hairs were compromised. Compared with the wild type, root hairs of eru-3 had more prolonged periods of elevated tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt followed by longer periods of dampened [Ca2+]cyt (Figures 2A to 2C; Supplemental Movie 1). Quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]cyt following the fast Fourier transform methods described by Schoenaers et al. (2018) showed that eru-3 displayed low frequency [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. The main frequency of [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in eru-3 root hairs was 0.003 ± 0.0002 Hz compared with 0.044 ± 0.0184 Hz in the wild type (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt oscillation at the tips of eru-3 was ∼3-fold higher than the wild type (Figure 2E). These results are in agreement with findings of Schoenaers et al. (2018) in which they showed decreased frequency and increased amplitude of pectin Ca2+ binding site oscillations in cap1/eru-2 root hairs. It is clear from our results that ERU is important for normal tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations, a process that is crucial for sustained root hair growth (Monshausen et al., 2008). Mechanistic links between PM-localized ERU and the maintenance of [Ca2+]cyt oscillations are unknown. However, demonstrating the true nature of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt defects in eru-3 root hairs enables the development of more accurate models that could be tested in the future to explain how ERU modulates tip growth.

See detailed methods in supplemental data.In light of the ERU localization data presented here and those reported by Schoenaers et al. (2018), the model by Bai et al. (2014), proposing that tonoplast-based NH4+ signaling is the major driver for ERU-mediated tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations and root hair growth, needs reexamination. Other CrRLK1Ls, such as FER, THESEUS1, HERCULES1, ANXUR, and BUDDHA’s PAPER SEAL, have all been shown to localize to the PM (Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007; Hématy et al., 2007; Boisson-Dernier et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2009; Duan et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2017). Our results and those of Schoenaers et al. (2018) clearly demonstrate that ERU is also a PM-localized CrRLK1L and should no longer be referred to as a vacuolar membrane-localized protein.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/",
    "abstract": "Abstract When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from a perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector (Sack, 1997; Tasaka et al., 1999; Kiss, 2000). The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003; Sato et al., 2015). Plant organs typically have a defined gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of a specific organ is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of a defined growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with a GSA of 180˚ and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with a GSA of 0˚. Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have a GSA between these values (Firn and Digby, 1997). Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status (Roychoudhry et al., 2013; Roychoudhry et al., 2017). Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as a composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (i.e. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution (Swarup et al., 2001; Rakusova et al., 2015), there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways (Guisinger and Kiss, 1999; Lofke et al., 2013; Vandenbussche et al., 2013; Pernisova et al., 2016). By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself (Myers et al., 1995) or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending (Tarui and Iino, 1999; Bastien et al., 2013; Okamoto et al., 2015). It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on a clinostat or in microgravity (Stanković et al., 1998b). The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism (Blancaflor, 2002; Bisgrove, 2008). Microtubules and filamentous-actin (F-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are defined by many regulatory proteins (Blancaflor, 2013). Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to a horizontal reorientation was quantified (Blancaflor, 2002). Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of F-actin such as latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin B can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots (Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Blancaflor et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004). The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with F-actin antagonists was recapitulated in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms (Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012). Furthermore, the A. thaliana shoot gravitropic response9 (sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment (Nakamura et al., 2011). Recently, delayed root gravitropism in A. thaliana actin-related protein 3 (arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled F-actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure (Zhou et al., 2016). It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation (Blancaflor, 2013). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally. As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots (Meudt, 1987; Kim et al., 2000; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin (Kim et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2007). In A. thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants), a small GTPase regulator of F-actin dynamics (Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization in A. thaliana roots in a manner similar to that of auxin (Lanza et al., 2012). Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be a component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants. The promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012; Blancaflor, 2013). However, a recent study with A. thaliana mutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB- or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). In the study by Okamoto et al. (2015), inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature of Z. mays roots treated with LatB (Hou et al., 2003). Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in a similar manner as LatB-treated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBL-mediated alterations in F-actin dynamics and organization.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Zea mays Root Growth and Drug Treatments Maize (Zea mays L. cultivar Merit) seeds were soaked for 10 to 12 h in deionized water. After soaking, seeds were planted side by side with the embryo facing down on 45 × 35 cm opaque plastic trays lined with moist germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co. USA). The seeds were covered with a second layer of germination paper and gentle pressure was applied to the paper so that surface tension between the two sheets of paper held the seeds in place. A second opaque plastic tray was placed on top of the first tray so that the two layers of germination paper containing the seeds were secured between the two trays. The trays were oriented vertically in a plastic tub filled with water to a depth of 5–10 cm to keep the germination paper moist. After 48 h, seedlings with 1–2 cm long straight primary roots were selected and treated with working solutions of LatB, eBL or the corresponding solvent control, which consisted of diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To treat roots, a set-up consisting of 1.5 ml microfuge tubes oriented vertically on microfuge holders was prepared. The center of the lid of the microfuge tube was punctured with the tip of a heated metal probe to create a 2 mm diameter hole, and 1 ml of the treatment solution was added to each tube. Selected seedlings were transferred one at a time to each microfuge tube by inserting the roots into the hole so that 20 mm of the root tip was immersed vertically in the solution. Seedlings were stabilized during treatment by mounting the kernel to the microfuge tube with caulking compound. Roots were incubated with 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 nM LatB and eBL and DMSO controls using this set-up for 1 h. Soaking, germination and treatment was done in a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) set to 24°C with 14 h (120 μmoles m-2 s-1)/10 h day/night cycle. Stock solutions of LatB (1mM; Calbiochem, USA) and eBL (10 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were prepared with 100% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and stored at -20°C prior to use. Working solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of stock solution to sterile de-ionized water. Z. mays Clinorotation Assays After treatment, five seedlings were selected from each treatment group and mounted on 10 × 10 cm square Petri dishes with double-sided foam tape. The lid of the Petri dish was lined with two layers of wet germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) to maintain high humidity. The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and mounted on a custom-built two-dimensional (2-D) clinostat located in the same Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for seed germination and root treatment. The Petri dishes were first mounted so that the roots were vertical (Appendix 1). After 60 min the Petri dishes were rotated by 90° so that roots were in a horizontal position. After 20 min, the clinostat was activated and roots were rotated for 20 h at 1 revolution per minute (RPM). Digital images of the roots after clinorotation were captured using a camera mounted on a copy stand. Each treatment was replicated three times using a total of 15–20 seedlings. Root curvature was measured using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Time-Lapse Imaging of Graviresponding Z. mays Roots Another set of Z. mays seedlings was treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL and the solvent control solution and mounted on square Petri dishes following the methods described above. The plates were positioned so that the roots were in a vertical orientation. After 60 min, the plates were rotated 90° so that the roots were horizontal. Immediately after rotation, images were captured every 15 min for 12 h. Time-lapse movies were generated using the Metamorph 5.0 image acquisition software (Universal Imaging Corp, USA). From the generated time-lapse movies, the root tip angle with respect to the horizontal was measured using ImageJ software. Experiments were repeated at least three independent times with 15-20 seedlings per treatment. F-Actin Labeling and Confocal Microscopy of Fixed Z. mays Roots Labeling and imaging of F-actin was essentially as described by Dyachok et al. (2016). Briefly, the apical 5 mm of roots incubated in LatB, eBL and the corresponding solvent control for 1 h were fixed in 50 mM piperazine- N,N ′ bis [2-ethansesulfonic acid], 2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid pH 7.0 (PME buffer) containing 5% DMSO and 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). After roots were washed with PME buffer, they were sectioned at a thickness of 70 μm using a Vibratome 1500 (Ted Pella Inc., USA). F-actin in the root sections was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, USA) suspended in PME buffer. After mounting sections on glass slides, they were imaged with an inverted Leica TCS-SP8-X confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective. Alexa-Fluor was excited with the 488 nm line of the white light laser and emission was detected at 522 nm. To enhance the resolution of F-actin images obtained from fixed roots for downstream quantitative analysis, the HyVolution deconvolution package (Huygens, The Netherlands) was used to process image data directly acquired with the Leica SP8-X system. Five optical sections taken at 0.5 μm intervals were acquired. Each dataset was then processed using the wizard-driven HyVolution user interface linked with the Leica Application Suite (LAS) software. Generation of M. truncatula Plants Expressing Fluorescent Protein-Based F-Actin Reporters Transgenic M. truncatula lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP and UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP were generated essentially as described in Jiang et al. (2019). Briefly, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 105 harboring Lifeact and ABD2 constructs were streaked on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin and 25 mg ml-1 rifampicin and cultured at 28°C for 2–3 days. A single colony was picked and then cultured in LB liquid media containing the same antibiotics for 16 h or until the OD600 was 0.6–0.8. The trifoliates located second from the top were collected from 4–6 week-old M. truncatula R108 plants grown at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night. The leaves were sterilized with 20% commercial bleach containing a drop of Tween-20 for 10 min and then washed three times with sterile water. The leaves were then infected with the A. tumefaciens suspension that was generated by centrifuging the A. tumefaciens liquid culture at 3,500 rpm for 20 min and then resuspending the pellets in liquid infection medium to an OD600 of 0.2–0.3. The infection procedure included a 10-min vacuum infiltration, a 3–5 min sonication and then another 10-min vacuum infiltration. After this, the infected leaves were blot dried and plated on co-cultivation medium. The trifoliate explants were transferred onto selection medium containing 10 mg ml-1 hygromycin after 24–30 h incubation under 24°C in the dark. Culture of the explants continued for an additional 5–6 weeks under the same conditions or until enough resistant calli were produced. The resistant calli were then transferred onto shoot regeneration medium and cultured under 150 μmoles m-2 s-1 light at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night cycle. After 2–3 months, plantlets were fully regenerated with functional roots. A couple of leaflets were sampled from the regenerated plants for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. DNA samples were PCR amplified with primers for hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (forward 5’- AAGGAATCGGTCAATACACTACATGG -3’ and reverse 5’- AAGACCAATGCGGAGCATATACG -3’). Confirmed transgenic plants were then screened using a fluorescent stereo microscope and those with GFP signal were transferred to soil and allowed to go to seed. Multiple, independent lines of both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP, and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were screened in the subsequent generations until homozygous positive lines were obtained. Growth Characterization of M. truncatula F-Actin Reporter Lines Seeds of both reporter lines and wild type (R108) were scarified in concentrated sulfuric acid for 8 min, washed with cold water, and then surface sterilized for 3 min in a solution containing 30% commercial bleach and 0.1% Tween-20. After decanting the bleach solution, the seeds were rinsed and stored overnight in the dark at room temperature. The seeds were placed onto sterile, moist filter paper in Petri dishes and stratified at 4°C in the dark for 2 days and then transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C and 16/8 h day/night (modified from Boisson-Dernier et al. (2001). After germinating, seedlings were transferred to square agar plates supplemented with ½ Murashige and Skoog medium. The plates were moved back to the growth chamber and positioned vertically to allow the roots to elongate on the agar media surface. The root tip of at least 16 plants per genotype was marked with a black dot. This process was repeated two times every 24 h for a total of 3 days. ImageJ was used to measure the average root elongation per day and this measurement was used as an indicator of the root growth rate. Plants were allowed to grow for four more days in plates, for a total of 7 days. The plates were imaged and RootNav software (University of Nottingham, UK) was used to automatically measure the primary root length (Pound et al., 2013). The plants were then transferred to pots filled with a mixture of turface and vermiculite (3:1), and then grown at 22°C and 16/8 h day/night for three more weeks, for a total of 28 days of growth. After this time, the plants were removed from the pots and the soil mixture was washed away from the roots. Roots and shoots were separated, bagged, and dried at 65°C for one week, before obtaining shoot and root dry weight. Clinorotation and F-Actin Imaging of M. truncatula Expressing F-Actin Reporters M. truncatula seeds were scarified with 150 grit sandpaper (3M, USA). Next, seeds were sterilized with 6% (v/v) sodium hypocholorite in 50 ml Falcon tubes (Corning, USA) for 10 min in room temperature, with intermittent rotation. Post-incubation, the seeds were rinsed six times with sterile deionized water and were spread out on 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma- Aldrich, USA) plates in 100 × 25 mm round petri dishes. Seeds were stratified for 2 days in the dark at 4°C. Plates were flipped upside-down and seeds were germinated by transferring them to a 24°C incubator for 20 h. Six seedlings with straight radicles that emerged into the air were selected and transferred onto a 10 ×10 cm square plates containing 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for subsequent treatment with germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) that was pre-soaked with either 100 nM LatB, 5 μM eBL or DMSO solvent control. The soaked germination paper was laid on the radicles of the seedlings for an hour in room temperature and the plate was set up vertically to enable radicles to continue growing vertically straight. Plates for clinorotation assays were prepared by filling 10 × 10 cm square plates with 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) up to half of the height of the plate. Once the agar had set, half of the agar was cut and removed from the plate with a razor blade. In addition, six shallow indentations for the cotyledons of six seedlings was cut with a razor blade. Each seedling was fitted into its respective indentation, with its cotyledon held by the agar and its radicle suspended into the air in the plate. Next, 52°C molten agar was pipetted on the cotyledons to hold each seedling firmly in its location. After growing seedlings vertically for 1 h, the plates were rotated 90° for 20 min followed by clinorotation for 15 h at 1 rpm on the clinostat. Post-treatment, images of the roots were taken using a camera mounted on a copy stand and root curvature was measured using ImageJ software. To image F-actin, 2-day-old seedlings with straight roots were transplanted onto 64 × 48 mm cover slips coated with a 2 mm thick slab of 1% agar. Transplanting was done by gently lifting the agar slab and placing the root on top of the cover slip. The lifted agar was then used to hold the root in place so that it lay between the agar and coverslip. Roots treated with LatB and eBL for 1 h were imaged immediately. Another set of transplanted seedlings was used to evaluate the quality of F-actin labeling in non-treated seedlings. For this set of seedlings, the cover slip with transplanted seedlings was placed in a 9 cm round Petri dish and transferred to the same Conviron (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for Z. mays clinostat assays. The Petri dishes were tilted at an angle of 60° to enable the root to grow close to the bottom surface of the coverslip. One to 2 days after transplanting, seedling roots were imaged with a Leica SPX-8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Live Cell Imaging of Dark Grown UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP M. truncatula Hypocotyls M. truncatula seeds expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were stratified on agar plates with ½ Murashige and Skoog medium at 4°C for 12–24 h. Seeds were exposed to light for 4 h and then kept in darkness for 3–5 days in a Conviron (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) set to 24°C and 14 h (120 μmoles m-2 s-1) and 10 h day/night cycle. The elongated hypocotyls were incubated in 500nM eBL and DMSO solvent control solution for 1 h. Fine actin filaments of epidermal cells adjacent to the hook region were imaged every second for 1 min with an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer, USA) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective (Staiger et al., 2009). Quantification of F-Actin Organization and Dynamics of Z. mays Fixed Roots and M. truncatula Live Roots For occupancy, skewing and eccentricity analysis, HyVolution processed images from fixed maize roots and live barrel medic roots were cropped manually using Adobe Photoshop CS5 so that only individual root cells occupied the image field of view. Each of the cropped images was processed by canceling the background noise followed by marking F-actin with one pixel-wide lines following the methods described in (Wang et al., 2008; Vidali et al., 2009; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Eccentricity was calculated from compact ellipse sections from cropped root images. This process included extraction of the intensity distribution of a low frequency spectrum at 95% CI (Confidence Interval) after applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the F-actin images following Dyachok et al. (2011); Nakashima et al. (2014) and Burkart et al. (2015). Therefore, eccentricity reflects the alignment properties of F-actin within each cell. Algorithms and software for occupancy and eccentricity analysis were written in MATLAB and used to automatically analyze all cell samples. Quantitative analysis of cell dynamics from movies obtained from an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer, USA), was conducted essentially as described in Dyachok et al. (2014) and Vidali et al. (2010). The algorithms and software were developed in MATLAB. Briefly, the software extracted 60 frames in the movie (1 frame per second). The software calculated the correlation and difference of each frame by averaging correlation and difference between this frame and all other frames. The correlation was defined as two-dimensional correlations between two matrixes, and the difference was considered by subtracting two matrixes after preprocessing for each matrix.",
    "results": "Results Epi-Brassinolide-Treated Z. mays Roots Exhibit Persistent Curvature on a Slowly Rotating Clinostat and Enhanced Gravitropism Previous reports have shown that LatB and eBL promoted gravitropism in roots (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The enhancement of gravitropic response in LatB-treated roots was more strongly manifested on a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat. For instance, Z. mays roots treated with LatB displayed persistent root curvature on the clinostat, as opposed to untreated roots that straightened (Hou et al., 2003). We hypothesized that the enhanced gravitropism of eBL-treated roots was likely to also be more prominent under clinorotation. Our experiment involved applying a perpendicular gravistimulus to roots for 20 min after pre-treating them for an hour with LatB or eBL followed by clinorotation for 20 h (Appendix 1). We found that eBL-treated roots mirrored the persistent curvature responses of LatB-treated roots (Figure 1A; Hou et al., 2003). Quantification of the angle of root curvature that developed on the clinostat revealed that LatB was more potent than eBL when tested at the same concentrations. For instance, LatB induced a strong curvature response at 100 nM concentration, whereas eBL elicited a similar curvature at a higher 500 nM concentration (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) and LatB enhanced gravitropism and dampened straightening of Z. mays roots. (A) Representative images of Z. mays roots grown on a 2-D clinostat for 20 h to test autotropic straightening after withdrawal of the gravity signal. Vertical roots treated with LatB and eBL for 1 h were mounted on a 2-D clinostat and kept horizontal for 20 min (white arrow indicates the direction of gravity) prior to clinorotation for 20 h. Note that untreated roots (solvent controls) straightened after reaching an angle of about 45° while roots treated with eBL or LatB did not. (B) Dose response of root curvature on a clinostat after eBL and LatB treatment. Angle of curvature was obtained as shown by the yellow arrow above the graph. Bars are means (n > 14 plants) ± S.E. ***P < 0.001, * P < 0.05 (Student’s t-test). (C) Time course of root gravitropism after vertically growing roots were placed horizontally without clinorotation. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n > 12 plants) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Next, we compared the kinetics of gravitropism of Z. mays roots pretreated for 1 h with 100 nM LatB or 500 nM eBL under continuous gravistimulation (i.e. roots reoriented 90° from the vertical without clinorotation). We found that roots treated with the solvent control solution grew downward and reached a maximum angle of about 80° from the horizontal at approximately 200 min. Control roots maintained this angle for the entire 720 min time course. By contrast, LatB- and eBL-treated roots overshot the vertical and reached maximum angle of approximately 110° after 250 min (Figure 1C). Overshooting of the vertical by LatB- and eBL- treated roots was followed by a correction to the vertical that began at about 300 min after orienting roots horizontally. Although both LatB- and eBL-treated roots exhibited similar kinetics with regard to their overshooting of the vertical, the subsequent overcorrection was more pronounced in eBL-treated roots. eBL-treated roots returned to an angle of about 60° at 450 min after gravistimulation, but eventually stabilized to a 90° growth angle by about 600 min. At the end of the 720 min time course, eBL-treated roots reached a similar angle as controls. By contrast, LatB-treated roots returned to about 90° at 450 min and maintained this growth angle for the duration of the time course (Figure 1C). Epi-Brassinolide Modifies F-Actin Organization in Z. mays Roots The similar effects of LatB and eBL on maize root gravitropism and autotropic root straightening on a 2-D clinostat (see Figure 1) led us to hypothesize that eBL may cause LatB-like effects on the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we studied F-actin organization in maize roots that were treated with LatB and eBL at concentrations that produced comparable root phenotypes (i.e.100 nM for LatB and 500 nM for eBL). After exposure to the compounds, roots were chemically fixed, sectioned and F-actin was labeled with phalloidin conjugated to a fluorophore (Dyachok et al., 2016). Consistent with our previous studies (Hou et al., 2003), distinct qualitative differences in F-actin organization were observed between roots treated with solvent controls and roots treated with 100 nM LatB in the meristem, transition zone and elongation zone. Whereas controls had extensive F-actin networks in various root developmental zones, LatB-treated roots had diffuse labeling or severely fragmented F-actin manifested primarily as bright puncta (Figure 2A). By contrast, roots treated with 500 nM eBL still had abundant F-actin networks in the various root developmental zones that appeared similar to control roots. Since roots treated with 500 nM eBL did not show obvious qualitative differences in F-actin organization compared with control roots, we increased the eBL treatment concentration to 1 and 5 µM. Nonetheless, even after treatment with 1 µM eBL, F-actin in various regions of the root appeared similar to untreated roots. Qualitative disruptions to F-actin only became obvious when eBL concentration was increased to 5 µM. At this concentration some root cells had diffuse fluorescence and fragmented F-actin that resembled LatB-treatment to some degree (Figure 2A). However, unlike LatB-treated roots, roots treated with 5 µM eBL contained more cells with intact F-actin networks that were similar to untreated roots. This result suggested that while eBL disrupts actin, its effects were milder than LatB. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) modified F-actin organization in Z. mays roots. (A) Single optical confocal micrographs of chemically-fixed and longitudinally-sectioned Z. mays roots stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin. Note that LatB-treated roots had diffuse staining and fragmentation of F-actin in the form of puncta and short filaments (arrowheads). Untreated (solvent controls) had extensive F-actin networks. 500 nM and 1 µM eBL on the other hand did not result in any visible effects on F-actin. At 5 µM eBL, some regions of the meristem, transition and elongation zone have diffuse fluorescence (arrows) and fragmented F-actin (arrowheads). (B, C) Combined box and scatter plots showing quantitative analysis of F-actin occupancy (density B) and skewness (bundling C) in root cells of the transition/elongation zone. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Asterisks (*) refers to individual data points and + mark outliers. Bars are means (n > 100 cells) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). Scale bars = 20 μm.To quantify the effect of LatB and eBL on the root F-actin networks, we acquired occupancy values from images of root cells within the transition and elongation zone. We focused on these root zones because they have been shown to contribute most to the differential growth during the gravity response (Baluska et al., 1996). Occupancy is a quantitative metric used to depict F-actin density with higher values indicating a denser F-actin network (Higaki et al., 2010b). Compared with controls, occupancy of F-actin in roots treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL, and 5 µM eBL was lower. Surprisingly, F-actin occupancy was significantly higher in roots treated with 1 µM eBL compared to control roots (Figure 2B). Taken together, our results show that eBL modifies F-actin organization in maize roots by causing a significant reduction in density. However, unlike roots treated with LatB, which showed more widespread disruption of F-actin, roots treated with eBL required higher concentrations (i.e. 5 µM) to detect distinct qualitative and quantitative effects on F-actin structure. Even at this higher concentration, impacts on F-actin appeared to be localized to random regions of the root (Figure 2A). Another metric that we used to quantify eBL effects on F-actin structure is skewness, which measures the degree of asymmetry of fluorescence intensity distribution. Skewness has been shown to be a good indicator of F-actin bundling (Higaki et al., 2010a). We found that while LatB treatment resulted in a small but significant increase in bundling, eBL at all concentrations, did not (Figure 2C). Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP Reporters Decorate Extensive F-Actin Networks in Living M. truncatula Seedlings Our studies on chemically-fixed roots of Z. mays, support the hypothesis that the effects of eBL on root gravitropism and autotropic straightening on a 2-D clinostat are due to disruptions in normal actin function (Figures 1 and 2). However, the results indicate that eBL only had modest effects on overall F-actin organization based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of chemically-fixed Z. mays roots (Figures 2A–C). Therefore, we next asked if effects of eBL on F-actin would be more obvious in living roots. To address this question, transgenic M. truncatula plants that expressed two live cell F-actin reporters (Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP) under the control of the ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) promoter were generated (Wang et al., 2008; Vidali et al., 2009; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Before using the lines for clinorotation assays, we first examined the quality of F-actin labeling in seedling roots. We found that Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP decorated extensive F-actin networks in various developmental regions of seedling roots. Distinct F-actin arrays were present in border cells, meristematic cells and cells in the transition/elongation zone. Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana, both Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP reporters labeled end walls and phragmoplasts in the meristem, and random and longitudinal F-actin cables in the elongation zone of M. truncatula seedling roots (Figure 3A). In agreement with previously published work with fixed and living roots, both reporters did not label distinct F-actin networks in the columella despite the presence of clear F-actin bundles in the peripheral cap and border cells. Only diffuse fluorescence was observed in the central columella of both reporter lines (Figure 3A; Baluska et al., 1997; Blancaflor, 2013). Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP also labeled extensive F-actin arrays in growing root hairs that were reminiscent of F-actin organization in A. thaliana lines expressing these two reporters (Figure 3B; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Moreover, other cell types in transgenic lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP and Lifeact-mGFP including guard cells, minor leaf veins and epidermal cells in nodules exhibited dense F-actin arrays (Figures 3C–E). Although primary root length and growth rate of 5-day-old M. truncatula seedlings expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP were similar to wild type (Figures 3F, G), dry weights of the same lines at 28 days were lower compared to wild type (Figures 3H, I). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Representative images of F-actin in various cells and tissues of M. truncatula seedlings expressing the UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP reporters.

Note that while peripheral cap (pc) and border cells (bc) have distinct F-actin arrays, the columella (c) region has diffuse fluorescent signal. Arrowheads in the root meristem mark the phragmoplasts. (B) Both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP decorate F-actin in growing root hairs. Extensive F-actin networks were also documented in guard cells of cotyledons (C), epidermal cells of minor veins of a young leaf (D) and epidermal cells in a young nodule (E). Scale bars = 10 µm (for A, C, D) 20 µm (for E), 50 µm (for low magnification images in B) and 10 µm (for high magnification images in B). Primary root length and primary root growth rate were not affected in UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP lines, compared to wild type (F, G). Actin reporter lines showed smaller root and shoot dry weight when compared to wild type, after 28 days of growth (H, I). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Bars are means (n > 16 plants) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). Epi-Brassinolide Triggers Enhanced Root Curvature Responses in M. truncatula on a Clinostat, But Only Had Mild Effects on F-Actin Organization We next asked if eBL could elicit similar enhancement of root curvature responses in M. truncatula on a clinostat that was previously observed in Z. mays roots (Figure 1). As 5 μM eBL was required to observe clear effects on F-actin in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots (Figure 2), we used the same concentration for the M. truncatula clinostat assays. Furthermore, we focused our clinostat assays on lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP. The GFP-ABD2-GFP lines were chosen for our root clinostat assays because F-actin in the transition and elongation zone was finer and less bundled compared to Lifeact-mGFP lines, an observation consistent with previous work on A. thaliana (Dyachok et al., 2014). Consistent with previous reports, LatB-treated M. truncatula roots expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat (Figures 4A, B; Hou et al., 2003). Like in Z. mays roots, eBL treatment caused M. truncatula roots to curve strongly on a clinostat (Figures 4A, B). Although, enhanced curvature on a clinostat was observed in LatB- and eBL-treated M. truncatula roots, the final average curvature was less than that observed in Z. mays (Compare Figure 1 and Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL)- and LatB- dampened straightening of M. truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. (A) Representative images of M. truncatula roots grown on a 2-D clinostat for 15 h to test autotropic straightening after withdrawal of the gravity signal. Vertical roots treated with 100 nM LatB and 5 μM eBL for 1 h were mounted on a 2-D clinostat and kept horizontal for 20 min prior to clinorotation. (B) Quantification of angle of curvature after 15 h of clinorotation. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n > 14 roots) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Having established that M. truncatula roots expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP F-actin reporter exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat, we then asked if F-actin organization in living roots was modified by eBL. We focused our analyses on root cells within the transition and elongation zone. Consistent with observations in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, F-actin in M. truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP was clearly disrupted after treatment with 100 nM LatB. While root epidermal cells in the elongation zone of untreated roots had extensive cortical F-actin networks, F-actin in the same region after 1 h exposure to 100 nM LatB were less dense and fragmented (Figure 5A). Moreover, F-actin in live M. truncatula roots treated with LatB had lower occupancy values, which corroborated results with chemically fixed Z. mays roots (Figure 5B). Experiments with eBL were less conclusive, particularly with regard to the impact on F-actin density. Surprisingly, F-actin in roots treated with 5 µM eBL had intact cortical F-actin networks that were qualitatively similar to untreated roots (Figure 5A). Quantitative analysis showed that F-actin occupancy values were consistent with the observation that 5 µM eBL had no significant effects on F-actin density in living roots (Figure 5B). Furthermore, while F-actin skewness increased in LatB-treated roots, this metric was not affected by 5 µM eBL (Figure 5C). Figure 5.

(B–D) Combined box and scatter plots showing quantitative analysis of F-actin occupancy (density), skewness (bundling) and eccentricity in root cells of the transition/elongation zone. Unlike LatB-treatment, no significant differences between eBL and solvent controls were detected with regard to F-actin occupancy (B) and skewness (C). However, a significant difference was observed between eBL and solvent controls with regard to the eccentricity metric, which refers to alignment of F-actin (D). Asterisks (*) refers to individual data points and + mark outliers. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Bars are means (n > 50 cells) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). Scale bar = 20 μm.Next, we asked if eBL had other measurable quantitative impacts on F-actin organization in living M. truncatula roots. For this analysis, the degree of orientation of F-actin in root cell images was analyzed using a metric called eccentricity. Lower eccentricity values indicate a more disordered F-actin network. Modified cortical F-actin eccentricity was reported in Physcomitrella patens ROP4 RNA interference (RNAi) lines (Burkart et al., 2015). Using metrics developed by Burkhart et al. (2015), we found that F-actin in living M. truncatula roots treated with 100 nM LatB and 5 µM eBL had significantly lower eccentricity values than F-actin in untreated roots. This result indicated that both LatB and eBL treatments led to more disordered F-actin (Figure 5D). Epi-Brassinolide Inhibits Global F-Actin Dynamics in Etiolated Hypocotyls of Living M. truncatula Seedlings Because actin function is defined not only by overall organization within cells, but also by dynamics (Staiger et al., 2009; Burkart et al., 2015), the effects of eBL on F-actin dynamics were analyzed. For these experiments, epidermal cells of etiolated barrel medic seedlings expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were used for analyzing F-actin dynamics. We used lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP for these analyses because the F-actin arrays in hypocotyls of these lines were more readily visualized than those expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. Roots were not used for this analysis because they grew out of the field of view within the desired 1 min period required for global actin dynamics analysis. Furthermore, the thick roots from M. truncatula were difficult to keep in the same focal plane during imaging, which complicated the interpretation of results. Cortical F-actin in M. truncatula hypocotyls were captured every second for 1 min and movies were used to quantify global changes in F-actin following the metrics developed by Vidali et al. (2010) (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). These metrics included pixel difference values that capture intensity differences between images every second, and correlation coefficients that indicate the degree of change (Figures 6A, B). A larger difference between pixels over time and a steeper decay in the correlation coefficient indicated a more dynamic F-actin network (Vidali et al., 2010; Dyachok et al., 2014; Burkart et al., 2015). The F-actin network in epidermal cells of eBL-treated etiolated M. truncatula hypocotyls had lower intensity difference values and a more gradual decay of the correlation coefficient compared to solvent control seedlings (Figures 6C, D). Taken together, these data imply that eBL treatment suppressed F-actin dynamics in etiolated M. truncatula hypocotyls. Figure 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this paper, a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat was used to gain additional insights into actin-mediated regulation of directional root growth. These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and amplified root coiling on a clinostat (Figure 1). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on a clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants (Kato et al., 2010; Okamoto et al., 2015; Talts et al., 2016). The hyperbending of inflorescence stems of myosin and actin A. thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism. With an aberrant acto-myosin system in fiber cells, it was proposed that the stems could no longer perceive their posture to initiate a straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). Here, we propose that a similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is a component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on F-actin. Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase (Blancaflor, 2013; Su et al., 2017). In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to a biochemical signal (Zheng et al., 2015). Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Hou et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse (Blancaflor, 2013). However, work on A. thaliana myosin XI mutants (Okamoto et al., 2015) and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Furthermore, given the difficulties in obtaining clear images of F-actin in the columella (Figure 3), we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mechanism of gravity sensing in the root transition zone might be affected by LatB (Wolverton et al., 2002). A number of studies have implicated eBL in directional root growth control. For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of A. thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in F-actin configurations in wild type (Lanza et al., 2012). Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type A. thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modification of F-actin assembly and disassembly (Li et al., 2005). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modifies F-actin organization in A. thaliana roots (Lanza et al., 2012), we found that eBL effects on F-actin organization in fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots were not as pronounced and consistent as those induced by LatB. Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in F-actin in both chemically-fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to find that 1 µM eBL led to increased F-actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (5 µM) than 1 µM led to reduced values (Figure 2B). Moreover, F-actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with 5 µM eBL was not different from untreated controls (Figures 5B, C). LatB-treatment on the other hand, led to an increase in F-actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of F-actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of F-actin in LatB- and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls (Figure 5D). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in F-actin alignment alone is sufficient to account for a large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the F-actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in F-actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically fixing roots at various time points during clinorotation or a system in which live roots expressing the F-actin reporters can be imaged on a clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. Okamoto et al. (2015) proposed that the long F-actin cables in the inflorescence stem fiber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by a population of F-actin in specific root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall F-actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global F-actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated M truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global F-actin dynamics after eBL exposure could modify targeting of plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as PIN2, leading to dampened autotropism (Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global F-actin dynamic data on M. truncatula root cells because of technical difficulties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope field of view. As such, a direct link between root F-actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future, a suitable clinostat assay using M. truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global F-actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live fluorescent protein-based F-actin marker lines in Z. mays could help strengthen the link between F-actin organization and autotropic organ growth (Wu et al., 2013). For more than a decade, genetically-encoded F-actin reporters based on fluorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development (Voigt et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008). In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces a set of M. truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded F-actin reporters. These new F-actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address a range of biological questions. Specifically, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy (Von Wangenheim et al., 2017). Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of F-actin during plant gravity response (Komis et al., 2018). Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of F-actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new M. truncatula lines (Ovečka et al., 2018). Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana plants expressing live cell F-actin reporters (Ketelaar et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2014), mature M. truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP M. truncatula lines should be a valuable addition to existing fluorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes (Ivanov and Harrison, 2014; Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics in a manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modifies F-actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses. Finally, through our work, we introduced a set of M. truncatula lines expressing fluorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.",

Copyright notice ID: 7010715 PMID: 32117357 Abstract When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics. Keywords: autotropism, actin, brassinosteroids, clinostat, cytoskeleton, gravitropism, root developmentIntroduction Plants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from a perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector (Sack, 1997; Tasaka et al., 1999; Kiss, 2000). The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003; Sato et al., 2015). Plant organs typically have a defined gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of a specific organ is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of a defined growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with a GSA of 180˚ and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with a GSA of 0˚. Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have a GSA between these values (Firn and Digby, 1997). Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status (Roychoudhry et al., 2013; Roychoudhry et al., 2017). Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as a composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (i.e. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution (Swarup et al., 2001; Rakusova et al., 2015), there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways (Guisinger and Kiss, 1999; Lofke et al., 2013; Vandenbussche et al., 2013; Pernisova et al., 2016). By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself (Myers et al., 1995) or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending (Tarui and Iino, 1999; Bastien et al., 2013; Okamoto et al., 2015). It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on a clinostat or in microgravity (Stanković et al., 1998b). The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism (Blancaflor, 2002; Bisgrove, 2008). Microtubules and filamentous-actin (F-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are defined by many regulatory proteins (Blancaflor, 2013). Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to a horizontal reorientation was quantified (Blancaflor, 2002). Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of F-actin such as latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin B can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots (Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Blancaflor et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004). The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with F-actin antagonists was recapitulated in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms (Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012). Furthermore, the A. thaliana shoot gravitropic response9 (sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment (Nakamura et al., 2011). Recently, delayed root gravitropism in A. thaliana actin-related protein 3 (arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled F-actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure (Zhou et al., 2016). It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation (Blancaflor, 2013). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally. As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots (Meudt, 1987; Kim et al., 2000; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin (Kim et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2007). In A. thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants), a small GTPase regulator of F-actin dynamics (Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization in A. thaliana roots in a manner similar to that of auxin (Lanza et al., 2012). Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be a component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants. The promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012; Blancaflor, 2013). However, a recent study with A. thaliana mutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB- or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). In the study by Okamoto et al. (2015), inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature of Z. mays roots treated with LatB (Hou et al., 2003). Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in a similar manner as LatB-treated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBL-mediated alterations in F-actin dynamics and organization.Materials and Methods Zea mays Root Growth and Drug Treatments Maize (Zea mays L. cultivar Merit) seeds were soaked for 10 to 12 h in deionized water. After soaking, seeds were planted side by side with the embryo facing down on 45 × 35 cm opaque plastic trays lined with moist germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co. USA). The seeds were covered with a second layer of germination paper and gentle pressure was applied to the paper so that surface tension between the two sheets of paper held the seeds in place. A second opaque plastic tray was placed on top of the first tray so that the two layers of germination paper containing the seeds were secured between the two trays. The trays were oriented vertically in a plastic tub filled with water to a depth of 5–10 cm to keep the germination paper moist. After 48 h, seedlings with 1–2 cm long straight primary roots were selected and treated with working solutions of LatB, eBL or the corresponding solvent control, which consisted of diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To treat roots, a set-up consisting of 1.5 ml microfuge tubes oriented vertically on microfuge holders was prepared. The center of the lid of the microfuge tube was punctured with the tip of a heated metal probe to create a 2 mm diameter hole, and 1 ml of the treatment solution was added to each tube. Selected seedlings were transferred one at a time to each microfuge tube by inserting the roots into the hole so that 20 mm of the root tip was immersed vertically in the solution. Seedlings were stabilized during treatment by mounting the kernel to the microfuge tube with caulking compound. Roots were incubated with 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 nM LatB and eBL and DMSO controls using this set-up for 1 h. Soaking, germination and treatment was done in a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) set to 24°C with 14 h (120 μmoles m-2 s-1)/10 h day/night cycle. Stock solutions of LatB (1mM; Calbiochem, USA) and eBL (10 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were prepared with 100% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and stored at -20°C prior to use. Working solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of stock solution to sterile de-ionized water. Z. mays Clinorotation Assays After treatment, five seedlings were selected from each treatment group and mounted on 10 × 10 cm square Petri dishes with double-sided foam tape. The lid of the Petri dish was lined with two layers of wet germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) to maintain high humidity. The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and mounted on a custom-built two-dimensional (2-D) clinostat located in the same Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for seed germination and root treatment. The Petri dishes were first mounted so that the roots were vertical (Appendix 1). After 60 min the Petri dishes were rotated by 90° so that roots were in a horizontal position. After 20 min, the clinostat was activated and roots were rotated for 20 h at 1 revolution per minute (RPM). Digital images of the roots after clinorotation were captured using a camera mounted on a copy stand. Each treatment was replicated three times using a total of 15–20 seedlings. Root curvature was measured using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).Time-Lapse Imaging of Graviresponding Z. mays Roots Another set of Z. mays seedlings was treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL and the solvent control solution and mounted on square Petri dishes following the methods described above. The plates were positioned so that the roots were in a vertical orientation. After 60 min, the plates were rotated 90° so that the roots were horizontal. Immediately after rotation, images were captured every 15 min for 12 h. Time-lapse movies were generated using the Metamorph 5.0 image acquisition software (Universal Imaging Corp, USA). From the generated time-lapse movies, the root tip angle with respect to the horizontal was measured using ImageJ software. Experiments were repeated at least three independent times with 15-20 seedlings per treatment.F-Actin Labeling and Confocal Microscopy of Fixed Z. mays Roots Labeling and imaging of F-actin was essentially as described by Dyachok et al. (2016). Briefly, the apical 5 mm of roots incubated in LatB, eBL and the corresponding solvent control for 1 h were fixed in 50 mM piperazine- N,N ′ bis [2-ethansesulfonic acid], 2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid pH 7.0 (PME buffer) containing 5% DMSO and 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). After roots were washed with PME buffer, they were sectioned at a thickness of 70 μm using a Vibratome 1500 (Ted Pella Inc., USA). F-actin in the root sections was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, USA) suspended in PME buffer. After mounting sections on glass slides, they were imaged with an inverted Leica TCS-SP8-X confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective. Alexa-Fluor was excited with the 488 nm line of the white light laser and emission was detected at 522 nm. To enhance the resolution of F-actin images obtained from fixed roots for downstream quantitative analysis, the HyVolution deconvolution package (Huygens, The Netherlands) was used to process image data directly acquired with the Leica SP8-X system. Five optical sections taken at 0.5 μm intervals were acquired. Each dataset was then processed using the wizard-driven HyVolution user interface linked with the Leica Application Suite (LAS) software.Generation of M. truncatula Plants Expressing Fluorescent Protein-Based F-Actin Reporters Transgenic M. truncatula lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP and UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP were generated essentially as described in Jiang et al. (2019). Briefly, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 105 harboring Lifeact and ABD2 constructs were streaked on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin and 25 mg ml-1 rifampicin and cultured at 28°C for 2–3 days. A single colony was picked and then cultured in LB liquid media containing the same antibiotics for 16 h or until the OD600 was 0.6–0.8. The trifoliates located second from the top were collected from 4–6 week-old M. truncatula R108 plants grown at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night. The leaves were sterilized with 20% commercial bleach containing a drop of Tween-20 for 10 min and then washed three times with sterile water. The leaves were then infected with the A. tumefaciens suspension that was generated by centrifuging the A. tumefaciens liquid culture at 3,500 rpm for 20 min and then resuspending the pellets in liquid infection medium to an OD600 of 0.2–0.3. The infection procedure included a 10-min vacuum infiltration, a 3–5 min sonication and then another 10-min vacuum infiltration. After this, the infected leaves were blot dried and plated on co-cultivation medium. The trifoliate explants were transferred onto selection medium containing 10 mg ml-1 hygromycin after 24–30 h incubation under 24°C in the dark. Culture of the explants continued for an additional 5–6 weeks under the same conditions or until enough resistant calli were produced. The resistant calli were then transferred onto shoot regeneration medium and cultured under 150 μmoles m-2 s-1 light at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night cycle. After 2–3 months, plantlets were fully regenerated with functional roots. A couple of leaflets were sampled from the regenerated plants for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. DNA samples were PCR amplified with primers for hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (forward 5’- AAGGAATCGGTCAATACACTACATGG -3’ and reverse 5’- AAGACCAATGCGGAGCATATACG -3’). Confirmed transgenic plants were then screened using a fluorescent stereo microscope and those with GFP signal were transferred to soil and allowed to go to seed. Multiple, independent lines of both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP, and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were screened in the subsequent generations until homozygous positive lines were obtained.Growth Characterization of M. truncatula F-Actin Reporter Lines Seeds of both reporter lines and wild type (R108) were scarified in concentrated sulfuric acid for 8 min, washed with cold water, and then surface sterilized for 3 min in a solution containing 30% commercial bleach and 0.1% Tween-20. After decanting the bleach solution, the seeds were rinsed and stored overnight in the dark at room temperature. The seeds were placed onto sterile, moist filter paper in Petri dishes and stratified at 4°C in the dark for 2 days and then transferred to a growth chamber at 22°C and 16/8 h day/night (modified from Boisson-Dernier et al. (2001). After germinating, seedlings were transferred to square agar plates supplemented with ½ Murashige and Skoog medium. The plates were moved back to the growth chamber and positioned vertically to allow the roots to elongate on the agar media surface. The root tip of at least 16 plants per genotype was marked with a black dot. This process was repeated two times every 24 h for a total of 3 days. ImageJ was used to measure the average root elongation per day and this measurement was used as an indicator of the root growth rate. Plants were allowed to grow for four more days in plates, for a total of 7 days. The plates were imaged and RootNav software (University of Nottingham, UK) was used to automatically measure the primary root length (Pound et al., 2013). The plants were then transferred to pots filled with a mixture of turface and vermiculite (3:1), and then grown at 22°C and 16/8 h day/night for three more weeks, for a total of 28 days of growth. After this time, the plants were removed from the pots and the soil mixture was washed away from the roots. Roots and shoots were separated, bagged, and dried at 65°C for one week, before obtaining shoot and root dry weight.Clinorotation and F-Actin Imaging of M. truncatula Expressing F-Actin Reporters M. truncatula seeds were scarified with 150 grit sandpaper (3M, USA). Next, seeds were sterilized with 6% (v/v) sodium hypocholorite in 50 ml Falcon tubes (Corning, USA) for 10 min in room temperature, with intermittent rotation. Post-incubation, the seeds were rinsed six times with sterile deionized water and were spread out on 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma- Aldrich, USA) plates in 100 × 25 mm round petri dishes. Seeds were stratified for 2 days in the dark at 4°C. Plates were flipped upside-down and seeds were germinated by transferring them to a 24°C incubator for 20 h. Six seedlings with straight radicles that emerged into the air were selected and transferred onto a 10 ×10 cm square plates containing 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for subsequent treatment with germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) that was pre-soaked with either 100 nM LatB, 5 μM eBL or DMSO solvent control. The soaked germination paper was laid on the radicles of the seedlings for an hour in room temperature and the plate was set up vertically to enable radicles to continue growing vertically straight. Plates for clinorotation assays were prepared by filling 10 × 10 cm square plates with 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) up to half of the height of the plate. Once the agar had set, half of the agar was cut and removed from the plate with a razor blade. In addition, six shallow indentations for the cotyledons of six seedlings was cut with a razor blade. Each seedling was fitted into its respective indentation, with its cotyledon held by the agar and its radicle suspended into the air in the plate. Next, 52°C molten agar was pipetted on the cotyledons to hold each seedling firmly in its location. After growing seedlings vertically for 1 h, the plates were rotated 90° for 20 min followed by clinorotation for 15 h at 1 rpm on the clinostat. Post-treatment, images of the roots were taken using a camera mounted on a copy stand and root curvature was measured using ImageJ software. To image F-actin, 2-day-old seedlings with straight roots were transplanted onto 64 × 48 mm cover slips coated with a 2 mm thick slab of 1% agar. Transplanting was done by gently lifting the agar slab and placing the root on top of the cover slip. The lifted agar was then used to hold the root in place so that it lay between the agar and coverslip. Roots treated with LatB and eBL for 1 h were imaged immediately. Another set of transplanted seedlings was used to evaluate the quality of F-actin labeling in non-treated seedlings. For this set of seedlings, the cover slip with transplanted seedlings was placed in a 9 cm round Petri dish and transferred to the same Conviron (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for Z. mays clinostat assays. The Petri dishes were tilted at an angle of 60° to enable the root to grow close to the bottom surface of the coverslip. One to 2 days after transplanting, seedling roots were imaged with a Leica SPX-8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany).Live Cell Imaging of Dark Grown UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP M. truncatula Hypocotyls M. truncatula seeds expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were stratified on agar plates with ½ Murashige and Skoog medium at 4°C for 12–24 h. Seeds were exposed to light for 4 h and then kept in darkness for 3–5 days in a Conviron (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) set to 24°C and 14 h (120 μmoles m-2 s-1) and 10 h day/night cycle. The elongated hypocotyls were incubated in 500nM eBL and DMSO solvent control solution for 1 h. Fine actin filaments of epidermal cells adjacent to the hook region were imaged every second for 1 min with an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer, USA) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective (Staiger et al., 2009).Quantification of F-Actin Organization and Dynamics of Z. mays Fixed Roots and M. truncatula Live Roots For occupancy, skewing and eccentricity analysis, HyVolution processed images from fixed maize roots and live barrel medic roots were cropped manually using Adobe Photoshop CS5 so that only individual root cells occupied the image field of view. Each of the cropped images was processed by canceling the background noise followed by marking F-actin with one pixel-wide lines following the methods described in (Wang et al., 2008; Vidali et al., 2009; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Eccentricity was calculated from compact ellipse sections from cropped root images. This process included extraction of the intensity distribution of a low frequency spectrum at 95% CI (Confidence Interval) after applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the F-actin images following Dyachok et al. (2011); Nakashima et al. (2014) and Burkart et al. (2015). Therefore, eccentricity reflects the alignment properties of F-actin within each cell. Algorithms and software for occupancy and eccentricity analysis were written in MATLAB and used to automatically analyze all cell samples. Quantitative analysis of cell dynamics from movies obtained from an UltraView ERS spinning-disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer, USA), was conducted essentially as described in Dyachok et al. (2014) and Vidali et al. (2010). The algorithms and software were developed in MATLAB. Briefly, the software extracted 60 frames in the movie (1 frame per second). The software calculated the correlation and difference of each frame by averaging correlation and difference between this frame and all other frames. The correlation was defined as two-dimensional correlations between two matrixes, and the difference was considered by subtracting two matrixes after preprocessing for each matrix.Results Epi-Brassinolide-Treated Z. mays Roots Exhibit Persistent Curvature on a Slowly Rotating Clinostat and Enhanced Gravitropism Previous reports have shown that LatB and eBL promoted gravitropism in roots (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The enhancement of gravitropic response in LatB-treated roots was more strongly manifested on a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat. For instance, Z. mays roots treated with LatB displayed persistent root curvature on the clinostat, as opposed to untreated roots that straightened (Hou et al., 2003). We hypothesized that the enhanced gravitropism of eBL-treated roots was likely to also be more prominent under clinorotation. Our experiment involved applying a perpendicular gravistimulus to roots for 20 min after pre-treating them for an hour with LatB or eBL followed by clinorotation for 20 h (Appendix 1). We found that eBL-treated roots mirrored the persistent curvature responses of LatB-treated roots (Figure 1A; Hou et al., 2003). Quantification of the angle of root curvature that developed on the clinostat revealed that LatB was more potent than eBL when tested at the same concentrations. For instance, LatB induced a strong curvature response at 100 nM concentration, whereas eBL elicited a similar curvature at a higher 500 nM concentration (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) and LatB enhanced gravitropism and dampened straightening of Z. mays roots. (A) Representative images of Z. mays roots grown on a 2-D clinostat for 20 h to test autotropic straightening after withdrawal of the gravity signal. Vertical roots treated with LatB and eBL for 1 h were mounted on a 2-D clinostat and kept horizontal for 20 min (white arrow indicates the direction of gravity) prior to clinorotation for 20 h. Note that untreated roots (solvent controls) straightened after reaching an angle of about 45° while roots treated with eBL or LatB did not. (B) Dose response of root curvature on a clinostat after eBL and LatB treatment. Angle of curvature was obtained as shown by the yellow arrow above the graph.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n > 12 plants) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Next, we compared the kinetics of gravitropism of Z. mays roots pretreated for 1 h with 100 nM LatB or 500 nM eBL under continuous gravistimulation (i.e. roots reoriented 90° from the vertical without clinorotation). We found that roots treated with the solvent control solution grew downward and reached a maximum angle of about 80° from the horizontal at approximately 200 min. Control roots maintained this angle for the entire 720 min time course. By contrast, LatB- and eBL-treated roots overshot the vertical and reached maximum angle of approximately 110° after 250 min (Figure 1C). Overshooting of the vertical by LatB- and eBL- treated roots was followed by a correction to the vertical that began at about 300 min after orienting roots horizontally. Although both LatB- and eBL-treated roots exhibited similar kinetics with regard to their overshooting of the vertical, the subsequent overcorrection was more pronounced in eBL-treated roots. eBL-treated roots returned to an angle of about 60° at 450 min after gravistimulation, but eventually stabilized to a 90° growth angle by about 600 min. At the end of the 720 min time course, eBL-treated roots reached a similar angle as controls. By contrast, LatB-treated roots returned to about 90° at 450 min and maintained this growth angle for the duration of the time course (Figure 1C).Epi-Brassinolide Modifies F-Actin Organization in Z. mays Roots The similar effects of LatB and eBL on maize root gravitropism and autotropic root straightening on a 2-D clinostat (see Figure 1) led us to hypothesize that eBL may cause LatB-like effects on the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we studied F-actin organization in maize roots that were treated with LatB and eBL at concentrations that produced comparable root phenotypes (i.e.100 nM for LatB and 500 nM for eBL). After exposure to the compounds, roots were chemically fixed, sectioned and F-actin was labeled with phalloidin conjugated to a fluorophore (Dyachok et al., 2016). Consistent with our previous studies (Hou et al., 2003), distinct qualitative differences in F-actin organization were observed between roots treated with solvent controls and roots treated with 100 nM LatB in the meristem, transition zone and elongation zone. Whereas controls had extensive F-actin networks in various root developmental zones, LatB-treated roots had diffuse labeling or severely fragmented F-actin manifested primarily as bright puncta (Figure 2A). By contrast, roots treated with 500 nM eBL still had abundant F-actin networks in the various root developmental zones that appeared similar to control roots. Since roots treated with 500 nM eBL did not show obvious qualitative differences in F-actin organization compared with control roots, we increased the eBL treatment concentration to 1 and 5 µM. Nonetheless, even after treatment with 1 µM eBL, F-actin in various regions of the root appeared similar to untreated roots. Qualitative disruptions to F-actin only became obvious when eBL concentration was increased to 5 µM. At this concentration some root cells had diffuse fluorescence and fragmented F-actin that resembled LatB-treatment to some degree (Figure 2A). However, unlike LatB-treated roots, roots treated with 5 µM eBL contained more cells with intact F-actin networks that were similar to untreated roots. This result suggested that while eBL disrupts actin, its effects were milder than LatB. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) modified F-actin organization in Z. mays roots. (A) Single optical confocal micrographs of chemically-fixed and longitudinally-sectioned Z. mays roots stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin. Note that LatB-treated roots had diffuse staining and fragmentation of F-actin in the form of puncta and short filaments (arrowheads). Untreated (solvent controls) had extensive F-actin networks. 500 nM and 1 µM eBL on the other hand did not result in any visible effects on F-actin. At 5 µM eBL, some regions of the meristem, transition and elongation zone have diffuse fluorescence (arrows) and fragmented F-actin (arrowheads). (B, C) Combined box and scatter plots showing quantitative analysis of F-actin occupancy (density B) and skewness (bundling C) in root cells of the transition/elongation zone. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Asterisks (*) refers to individual data points and + mark outliers. Bars are means (n > 100 cells) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). Scale bars = 20 μm.To quantify the effect of LatB and eBL on the root F-actin networks, we acquired occupancy values from images of root cells within the transition and elongation zone. We focused on these root zones because they have been shown to contribute most to the differential growth during the gravity response (Baluska et al., 1996). Occupancy is a quantitative metric used to depict F-actin density with higher values indicating a denser F-actin network (Higaki et al., 2010b). Compared with controls, occupancy of F-actin in roots treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL, and 5 µM eBL was lower. Surprisingly, F-actin occupancy was significantly higher in roots treated with 1 µM eBL compared to control roots (Figure 2B). Taken together, our results show that eBL modifies F-actin organization in maize roots by causing a significant reduction in density. However, unlike roots treated with LatB, which showed more widespread disruption of F-actin, roots treated with eBL required higher concentrations (i.e. 5 µM) to detect distinct qualitative and quantitative effects on F-actin structure. Even at this higher concentration, impacts on F-actin appeared to be localized to random regions of the root (Figure 2A). Another metric that we used to quantify eBL effects on F-actin structure is skewness, which measures the degree of asymmetry of fluorescence intensity distribution. Skewness has been shown to be a good indicator of F-actin bundling (Higaki et al., 2010a). We found that while LatB treatment resulted in a small but significant increase in bundling, eBL at all concentrations, did not (Figure 2C).Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP Reporters Decorate Extensive F-Actin Networks in Living M. truncatula Seedlings Our studies on chemically-fixed roots of Z. mays, support the hypothesis that the effects of eBL on root gravitropism and autotropic straightening on a 2-D clinostat are due to disruptions in normal actin function (Figures 1 and 2). However, the results indicate that eBL only had modest effects on overall F-actin organization based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of chemically-fixed Z. mays roots (Figures 2A–C). Therefore, we next asked if effects of eBL on F-actin would be more obvious in living roots. To address this question, transgenic M. truncatula plants that expressed two live cell F-actin reporters (Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP) under the control of the ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) promoter were generated (Wang et al., 2008; Vidali et al., 2009; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Before using the lines for clinorotation assays, we first examined the quality of F-actin labeling in seedling roots. We found that Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP decorated extensive F-actin networks in various developmental regions of seedling roots. Distinct F-actin arrays were present in border cells, meristematic cells and cells in the transition/elongation zone. Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana, both Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP reporters labeled end walls and phragmoplasts in the meristem, and random and longitudinal F-actin cables in the elongation zone of M. truncatula seedling roots (Figure 3A). In agreement with previously published work with fixed and living roots, both reporters did not label distinct F-actin networks in the columella despite the presence of clear F-actin bundles in the peripheral cap and border cells. Only diffuse fluorescence was observed in the central columella of both reporter lines (Figure 3A; Baluska et al., 1997; Blancaflor, 2013). Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP also labeled extensive F-actin arrays in growing root hairs that were reminiscent of F-actin organization in A. thaliana lines expressing these two reporters (Figure 3B; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Moreover, other cell types in transgenic lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP and Lifeact-mGFP including guard cells, minor leaf veins and epidermal cells in nodules exhibited dense F-actin arrays (Figures 3C–E). Although primary root length and growth rate of 5-day-old M. truncatula seedlings expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP were similar to wild type (Figures 3F, G), dry weights of the same lines at 28 days were lower compared to wild type (Figures 3H, I). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Representative images of F-actin in various cells and tissues of M. truncatula seedlings expressing the UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP reporters. (A) F-actin in various developmental regions of seedling primary roots. Numbers (1-5) in (A, B) correspond to regions of the bright field image of the root shown in (panel A). 1 = root cap, 2 = border cells, 3 = meristem 4 = elongation zone, 5 = root hairs. Note that while peripheral cap (pc) and border cells (bc) have distinct F-actin arrays, the columella (c) region has diffuse fluorescent signal. Arrowheads in the root meristem mark the phragmoplasts. (B) Both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP decorate F-actin in growing root hairs. Extensive F-actin networks were also documented in guard cells of cotyledons (C), epidermal cells of minor veins of a young leaf (D) and epidermal cells in a young nodule (E). Scale bars = 10 µm (for A, C, D) 20 µm (for E), 50 µm (for low magnification images in B) and 10 µm (for high magnification images in B). Primary root length and primary root growth rate were not affected in UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP lines, compared to wild type (F, G). Actin reporter lines showed smaller root and shoot dry weight when compared to wild type, after 28 days of growth (H, I). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Bars are means (n > 16 plants) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Epi-Brassinolide Triggers Enhanced Root Curvature Responses in M. truncatula on a Clinostat, But Only Had Mild Effects on F-Actin Organization We next asked if eBL could elicit similar enhancement of root curvature responses in M. truncatula on a clinostat that was previously observed in Z. mays roots (Figure 1). As 5 μM eBL was required to observe clear effects on F-actin in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots (Figure 2), we used the same concentration for the M. truncatula clinostat assays. Furthermore, we focused our clinostat assays on lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP. The GFP-ABD2-GFP lines were chosen for our root clinostat assays because F-actin in the transition and elongation zone was finer and less bundled compared to Lifeact-mGFP lines, an observation consistent with previous work on A. thaliana (Dyachok et al., 2014). Consistent with previous reports, LatB-treated M. truncatula roots expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat (Figures 4A, B; Hou et al., 2003). Like in Z. mays roots, eBL treatment caused M. truncatula roots to curve strongly on a clinostat (Figures 4A, B). Although, enhanced curvature on a clinostat was observed in LatB- and eBL-treated M. truncatula roots, the final average curvature was less than that observed in Z. mays (Compare Figure 1 and Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Epi-Brassinolide (eBL)- and LatB- dampened straightening of M. truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. (A) Representative images of M. truncatula roots grown on a 2-D clinostat for 15 h to test autotropic straightening after withdrawal of the gravity signal. Vertical roots treated with 100 nM LatB and 5 μM eBL for 1 h were mounted on a 2-D clinostat and kept horizontal for 20 min prior to clinorotation. (B) Quantification of angle of curvature after 15 h of clinorotation. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Means (n > 14 roots) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test).Having established that M. truncatula roots expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP F-actin reporter exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat, we then asked if F-actin organization in living roots was modified by eBL. We focused our analyses on root cells within the transition and elongation zone. Consistent with observations in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, F-actin in M. truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP was clearly disrupted after treatment with 100 nM LatB. While root epidermal cells in the elongation zone of untreated roots had extensive cortical F-actin networks, F-actin in the same region after 1 h exposure to 100 nM LatB were less dense and fragmented (Figure 5A). Moreover, F-actin in live M. truncatula roots treated with LatB had lower occupancy values, which corroborated results with chemically fixed Z. mays roots (Figure 5B). Experiments with eBL were less conclusive, particularly with regard to the impact on F-actin density. Surprisingly, F-actin in roots treated with 5 µM eBL had intact cortical F-actin networks that were qualitatively similar to untreated roots (Figure 5A). Quantitative analysis showed that F-actin occupancy values were consistent with the observation that 5 µM eBL had no significant effects on F-actin density in living roots (Figure 5B). Furthermore, while F-actin skewness increased in LatB-treated roots, this metric was not affected by 5 µM eBL (Figure 5C). Figure 5.

(B–D) Combined box and scatter plots showing quantitative analysis of F-actin occupancy (density), skewness (bundling) and eccentricity in root cells of the transition/elongation zone. Unlike LatB-treatment, no significant differences between eBL and solvent controls were detected with regard to F-actin occupancy (B) and skewness (C). However, a significant difference was observed between eBL and solvent controls with regard to the eccentricity metric, which refers to alignment of F-actin (D). Asterisks (*) refers to individual data points and + mark outliers. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Bars are means (n > 50 cells) ± S.E. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). Scale bar = 20 μm.Next, we asked if eBL had other measurable quantitative impacts on F-actin organization in living M. truncatula roots. For this analysis, the degree of orientation of F-actin in root cell images was analyzed using a metric called eccentricity. Lower eccentricity values indicate a more disordered F-actin network. Modified cortical F-actin eccentricity was reported in Physcomitrella patens ROP4 RNA interference (RNAi) lines (Burkart et al., 2015). Using metrics developed by Burkhart et al. (2015), we found that F-actin in living M. truncatula roots treated with 100 nM LatB and 5 µM eBL had significantly lower eccentricity values than F-actin in untreated roots. This result indicated that both LatB and eBL treatments led to more disordered F-actin (Figure 5D).Epi-Brassinolide Inhibits Global F-Actin Dynamics in Etiolated Hypocotyls of Living M. truncatula Seedlings Because actin function is defined not only by overall organization within cells, but also by dynamics (Staiger et al., 2009; Burkart et al., 2015), the effects of eBL on F-actin dynamics were analyzed. For these experiments, epidermal cells of etiolated barrel medic seedlings expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were used for analyzing F-actin dynamics. We used lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP for these analyses because the F-actin arrays in hypocotyls of these lines were more readily visualized than those expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. Roots were not used for this analysis because they grew out of the field of view within the desired 1 min period required for global actin dynamics analysis. Furthermore, the thick roots from M. truncatula were difficult to keep in the same focal plane during imaging, which complicated the interpretation of results. Cortical F-actin in M. truncatula hypocotyls were captured every second for 1 min and movies were used to quantify global changes in F-actin following the metrics developed by Vidali et al. (2010) (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). These metrics included pixel difference values that capture intensity differences between images every second, and correlation coefficients that indicate the degree of change (Figures 6A, B). A larger difference between pixels over time and a steeper decay in the correlation coefficient indicated a more dynamic F-actin network (Vidali et al., 2010; Dyachok et al., 2014; Burkart et al., 2015). The F-actin network in epidermal cells of eBL-treated etiolated M. truncatula hypocotyls had lower intensity difference values and a more gradual decay of the correlation coefficient compared to solvent control seedlings (Figures 6C, D). Taken together, these data imply that eBL treatment suppressed F-actin dynamics in etiolated M. truncatula hypocotyls. Figure 6.

These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and amplified root coiling on a clinostat (Figure 1). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on a clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants (Kato et al., 2010; Okamoto et al., 2015; Talts et al., 2016). The hyperbending of inflorescence stems of myosin and actin A. thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism. With an aberrant acto-myosin system in fiber cells, it was proposed that the stems could no longer perceive their posture to initiate a straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). Here, we propose that a similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is a component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on F-actin. Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase (Blancaflor, 2013; Su et al., 2017). In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to a biochemical signal (Zheng et al., 2015). Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Hou et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse (Blancaflor, 2013). However, work on A. thaliana myosin XI mutants (Okamoto et al., 2015) and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stanković et al., 1998b). Furthermore, given the difficulties in obtaining clear images of F-actin in the columella (Figure 3), we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mechanism of gravity sensing in the root transition zone might be affected by LatB (Wolverton et al., 2002). A number of studies have implicated eBL in directional root growth control. For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of A. thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in F-actin configurations in wild type (Lanza et al., 2012). Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type A. thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modification of F-actin assembly and disassembly (Li et al., 2005). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modifies F-actin organization in A. thaliana roots (Lanza et al., 2012), we found that eBL effects on F-actin organization in fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots were not as pronounced and consistent as those induced by LatB. Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in F-actin in both chemically-fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to find that 1 µM eBL led to increased F-actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (5 µM) than 1 µM led to reduced values (Figure 2B). Moreover, F-actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with 5 µM eBL was not different from untreated controls (Figures 5B, C). LatB-treatment on the other hand, led to an increase in F-actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of F-actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of F-actin in LatB- and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls (Figure 5D). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in F-actin alignment alone is sufficient to account for a large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the F-actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in F-actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically fixing roots at various time points during clinorotation or a system in which live roots expressing the F-actin reporters can be imaged on a clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. Okamoto et al. (2015) proposed that the long F-actin cables in the inflorescence stem fiber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by a population of F-actin in specific root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall F-actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global F-actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated M truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global F-actin dynamics after eBL exposure could modify targeting of plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as PIN2, leading to dampened autotropism (Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global F-actin dynamic data on M. truncatula root cells because of technical difficulties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope field of view. As such, a direct link between root F-actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future, a suitable clinostat assay using M. truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global F-actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live fluorescent protein-based F-actin marker lines in Z. mays could help strengthen the link between F-actin organization and autotropic organ growth (Wu et al., 2013). For more than a decade, genetically-encoded F-actin reporters based on fluorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development (Voigt et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008). In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces a set of M. truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded F-actin reporters. These new F-actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address a range of biological questions. Specifically, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy (Von Wangenheim et al., 2017). Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of F-actin during plant gravity response (Komis et al., 2018). Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of F-actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new M. truncatula lines (Ovečka et al., 2018). Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana plants expressing live cell F-actin reporters (Ketelaar et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2014), mature M. truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP M. truncatula lines should be a valuable addition to existing fluorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes (Ivanov and Harrison, 2014; Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics in a manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modifies F-actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses. Finally, through our work, we introduced a set of M. truncatula lines expressing fluorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.Data Availability Statement All datasets for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.Author Contributions LB, AP-G, AC, and EB conceived and designed the research.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt. Keywords: GCaMP3, Arabidopsis, cell type specificity, calcium response, [Ca2+]cyt",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Calcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+ acts as a stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and an efflux of stored Ca2+ from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via a concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the cytoplasm [1]. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [1,2,3]. This low concentration is maintained through H+/Ca2+ antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+ into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [3,4]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+ back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [2], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane. Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate a second messenger cascade [4,5]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+ response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+ as a second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-1. When Ca2+ levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to a specific stimulus, these indicator dyes increased fluorescence [6]. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [6,7]. Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of a suite of fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and other marine organisms [8,9]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these fluorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+ binding [8]. Ca2+ binding induced changes in the conformation of fluorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced fluorescence emission. One example of a genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [1,10]. GCaMP3 is a modified form of GCaMP that features a circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP) flanked by CaM and M13 that gives low fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+ to the CaM domain [11]. To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S) and Ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) [12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cyt changes across entire plant organs [5,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique [Ca2+]cyt signature. While [Ca2+]cyt changes typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within specific tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated a set of lines in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, expressing GCaMP3 targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type specific promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cyt changes in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cyt increases in plants.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Generation of Cell-Type Specific Promoter GCaMP Lines Each promoter was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table S1). The sequence preceding the start codon for each gene was used in each instance. The resulting fragments were digested with PstI and SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector [32]. GCaMP3 was amplified from plasmid DNA and digested with XmaI and BstEII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and then cloned behind each promoter construct in pCAMBIA1390. To generate UBQ10:GCaMP3, a similar approach was taken. GCaMP3 was again amplified from plasmid DNA and then digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and cloned behind the Ubiquitin 10 promoter in a previously described pCAMIA1390 vector [33]. Plasmid containing GCaMP3 was a gift from Loren Looger (Addgene plasmid # 22692; http://n2t.net/addgene:22692; RRID:Addgene_22692; [34]). Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the floral dip method was used to generate Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants expressing the GCaMP3 constructs [35]. All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2. 4.2. Preparation of A. thaliana Seedlings for Imaging Seeds of the various A. thaliana GCaMP3 lines were planted on coverslips coated with a thin layer of MS-supplemented low-melting agarose. This set-up was prepared by pouring 3 mL of autoclaved 0.5% low-melting agarose in 0.5X MS solution (pH 5.7) on 48 × 60 mm No. 1 coverslips (Thermo Scientific, gold seal cover glass reorder no. 3334, Waltham, MA, USA; www.thermoscientific.com) as described in Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5]. Coverslips with polymerized agarose were placed in 9 cm diameter round Petri dishes and stored at 4 °C prior to planting seeds. In another set of experiments, seeds were planted as soon as the agarose polymerized. Petri dishes and coverslips with the planted seeds were kept in 4 °C for 2 days and transferred to a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, MB, Canada) set to 24 °C with 14 h/10 h day/night cycle. Petri dishes with the coverslips were kept vertical to enable the roots to grow down and straight along the surface of the agarose. Seedlings were imaged when primary roots were about 3–4 cm long, which was 5–6 days after transfer to the Conviron. 4.3. Validation of GCaMP3 Expression in Root Cell Types Validation of GCaMP3 expression in the target root cell types was conducted with an inverted Leica TCS SP8-X Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany; http://leica-microsystems.com). Seedlings from the Conviron were secured in a horizontal orientation on the stage of the microscope. Seedling roots were illuminated with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser using a 40× (numerical aperture 1.1) water immersion objective and emitted light detected at 510 nm. For some lines, single optical images were acquired at a pixel resolution of 1024 × 1024. For other lines, a Z-series was acquired by capturing 81 images at 0.4 µm intervals and 3-D images were generated using the LAS visualization software of the Leica confocal microscope. 4.4. Chemical Treatments and Measurement of Ca2+-Dependent GCaMP3 Fluorescence Stock solutions of 1 M ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; A7699-1G), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; G1149-100G), aluminum chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas. No. 7784-13-6) and sodium chloride (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; 3624-19) were made with deionized water and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Working solutions of 1 mM Al3+, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM Glu, and 150 mM NaCl were made by adding the appropriate volume of the stock solution in 0.5X MS at pH 5.7. Working solutions were made fresh prior to the imaging experiments. To measure [Ca2+]cyt-dependent GCaMP3 fluorescence, images of growing roots were acquired every 1 s for 10 to 15 min using the Leica SP8-X confocal microscope. Images were captured at a scanning speed of 600 MHz and pixel resolution of 512 × 300. Baseline GCaMP3 fluorescence of the roots was first acquired for 1 min after placing seedlings on the stage of the microscope. Twenty µL of the treatment solution was then added on top of the agarose medium where the root was growing using an adjustable volume pipette while imaging continued. From the collected images, the average fluorescence intensity was acquired by marking a rectangular region of interest corresponding to the specific cell type using the rectangular selection tool of the SPX-8 LAS software. GCaMP3 fluorescence (F) values were normalized using the formula I= F−F0F0 where F is the fluorescence intensity at some time point and F0 is the lowest fluorescence intensity point for the data set. Normalized fluorescence values were reported as the mean ± SE of at least three independent seedlings per GCaMP3 construct [36]. Another round of intensity video imaging was taken for the 0.5× MS control solution to generate the MS control fluorescence curves.",

Expression of GCaMP3 in Different Root Cell Types of A. thaliana To the best of our knowledge, plant lines expressing genetically encoded [Ca2+]cyt sensors that are available to the scientific community are driven by constitutive promoters. A. thaliana lines expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct, which we generated and used previously to study [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in root hairs [17], is one example. In addition to root hairs, GCaMP3 fluorescence was detected in all cell-types of the primary root of A. thaliana expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct (Figure 1). Using confocal microscopy, strong fluorescence was observed in cells located at the root surface, such as the peripheral root cap and epidermis (Figure 1A,B,D). Moderate levels of fluorescence could also be detected in the underlying cortex (Figure 1C). However, in cells located deeper within the root, such as the columella and endodermis, fluorescence was obscured by the fluorescence from surface cells (Figure 1A,B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Confocal imaging of primary roots of 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3. Representative bright-field and corresponding single-optical section confocal images of the root tip with a focus on the root cap (A), meristem (B), and elongation zone (C,D). c = columella; end = endodermis; epi = epidermis; cor = cortex. Scale bar: 50 μm.This prompted us to generate a set of constructs that drive GCaMP3 expression in specific root cell types. For this purpose, we used promoters described in the SWELL promoter collection including ATHB8 (columella), SCARECROW (SCR, endodermis), Pin-Formed 2 (PIN2, epidermis and cortex), PEP (cortex), and Proline rich protein 3(PRP3, trichoblasts) [16]. For the five constructs, we found that GCaMP3 signal was most prominent in the expected cell types (Figure 2). For example, ATHB8 and SCR promoters drove strong GCaMP3 expression in the columella and endodermis, respectively (Figure 2A,B). For ATHB8:GCaMP3-expressing lines, we also observed weak fluorescence in the peripheral cap cells and the stele. For SCR:GCaMP3, fluorescence in the endodermis was observed in all root developmental zones from the meristem and elongation zone, continuing into the maturation zone. Roots of PEP:GCaMP3- and PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings also showed fluorescence in the expected cell types (i.e., cortex and trichoblast, respectively) (Figure 2C,D). On the other hand, fluorescence was detected in the epidermis and cortex of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines, consistent with observations of Marques-Bueno et al. (2016) [16] (Figure 2E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Expression of GCaMP3 in specific root cell types. Representative bright-field and confocal images of primary roots of 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings expressing ATHB8:GCaMP3 (A), SCR:GCaMP3 (B), and PEP:GCaMP3 (C), respectively. ATHB8:GCaMP3 is expressed in the columella with some fluorescence visible in the stele. SCR:GCaMP3 is expressed in the endodermis and PEP:GCaMP3 is expressed in the cortex. Maximum projection images (top panel in (D)) and computer reconstructed transverse section (lower panel in (D)) of the root maturation zone of seedlings expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 show fluorescence confined to the trichoblasts. A maximum projection image of the root elongation zone of seedlings expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 (E). The small box on the upper right corner of panel E shows a computer reconstructed cross-section of the primary root of a PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing line. The image was generated from 50 optical sections taken at 0.50 μm intervals. Note that GCaMP3 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and cortex. c = columella; ste = stele; epi = epidermis; cor = cortex; end = endodermis; t = trichoblast; a = atrichoblasts. Scale bar: 50 μm. 2.2. Chemical Treatments of Cell-Type Specific GCaMP3 Constructs Studies on Ca2+ signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cyt including cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [5,18,19,20,21,22,23]. We used some of these known [Ca2+]cyt triggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell-specific GCaMP3 lines. We first analyzed the response of the GCaMP3 lines to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (Figure 3). In mammalian systems, ATP is a neurotransmitter that is perceived by plasma membrane bound purinergic receptors, and its signaling role is facilitated through increases in [Ca2+]cyt [24]. While plants do not have the canonical purinergic receptors found in mammals, they perceive ATP via lectin receptor-like kinases and, similar to mammals, ATP elicits a rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt [25,26,27]. Comparable to previous reports, application of ATP to the elongation zone of roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 elicited a rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent fluorescence followed by a gradual decline (Figure 3A) [5,25]. To determine if the increase in [Ca2+]cyt was due exclusively to ATP, we applied the solvent control solution, which consisted of 0.5× Murashige Skoog (MS) solution without ATP to roots. We found that applying MS solution triggered a rise in [Ca2+]cyt that was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to the [Ca2+]cyt change caused by ATP (Figure 3A). This observation suggests that under our growing conditions, adding a drop of solvent control solution to the root can induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt, which could be the result of a touch or hypoosmotic response [19,20,27,28]. Therefore, in testing the cell-type GCaMP3 lines, we included solvent control applications in all of the experiments so we could tease apart [Ca2+]cyt changes due to the desired stimulus from those resulting from a touch or hypoosmotic response. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca2+]cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM ATP application. The leftmost panel shows an inverted fluorescence image of the terminal 300 μm of an A. thaliana primary root to illustrate different cells in which GCaMP3 was expressed. Cell types are color coded with green = epidermis; blue = cortex; orange = endodermis; purple = columella; and the pink cells in the inset in panel C = trichoblast. (A–F) Quantification of [Ca2+]cyt -dependent fluorescence of various lines expressing GCaMP3 after ATP and solvent control (0.5× MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–6 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.Upon applying ATP to roots expressing cell-specific GCaMP3 lines, we found similarities and differences in the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures. For example, the PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, which expressed GCaMP3 in the epidermis and cortex (Figure 2), displayed similar [Ca2+]cyt signatures as UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines in response to ATP and the solvent control solution (Figure 3A,B). This is not surprising given that GCaMP3 is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of the UBQ10 and PIN2 promoters (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered a small increase in [Ca2+]cyt that had similar patterns (Figure 3C). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in cells located in the root interior such as the cortex, endodermis, and columella (supplementary video 1), ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases resembled the patterns of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines. However, the [Ca2+]cyt increases triggered by application of MS control solution were not as prominent in these lines when compared to those lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the epidermis (Figure 3D–F). The next chemical we used to test the cell-specific GCaMP3 lines was glutamic acid (Figure 4). Like ATP, glutamic acid (glutamate) is a neurotransmitter in mammalian cells that can trigger a [Ca2+]cyt increase [5,14]. Application of glutamate to the elongation zone of roots expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct induced a strong initial [Ca2+]cyt increase with a quick return to equilibrium (Figure 4A). The [Ca2+]cyt spikes induced by application of MS controls were also observed in this dataset. Compared to glutamate, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt increase was delayed in roots treated with MS solution. In this case, however, the [Ca2+]cyt spikes triggered by glutamate and the MS control solution were similar in amplitude (Figure 4A). Like the ATP treatment, [Ca2+]cyt response of roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 to glutamate was similar to roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3. Furthermore, [Ca2+]cyt changes in the root elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings in response to the MS control solution was delayed, but exhibited a lower amplitude (Figure 4B). Lines expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 also had a strong initial [Ca2+]cyt peak after glutamate treatment with a rapid return to equilibrium that resembled UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Like UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, application of MS control solution elicited a [Ca2+]cyt response that was delayed when compared to glutamate exposure (Figure 4C). By contrast, PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed a dampened response to glutamate compared to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the root surface (Figure 4D). Close examination of the time course of [Ca2+]cyt signals in the cortex after glutamate application revealed a triphasic response, with two larger peaks and a delayed smaller peak. Surprisingly, the amplitude of glutamate-triggered [Ca2+]cyt increases in the cortex was less than that of MS treated roots (Figure 4D). The lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 and ATHB8:GCaMP3 showed monophasic responses to glutamate with a gradual return to equilibrium, similar to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cells. Furthermore, unlike lines with GCaMP expressed in the cortex and root surface cells, the MS control solution response for endodermis- and columella- targeted GCaMP3 had delayed responses and lower amplitudes (Figure 4E,F).

Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.The third chemical we tested against the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was Al3+ in the form of aluminum chloride (Figure 5). Al3+ is a toxic tri-valent cation that competes with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ to increase the activity of Ca2+-ATPases while disrupting transport of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane [5,29]. Similar to previous treatments, the root elongation zone of seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 showed a monophasic [Ca2+]cyt response to Al3+ (Figure 5A). The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to ATP, glutamate and solvent control application (Figure 3A, Figure 4A and Figure 5A) [5]. In roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3, Al3+ application elicited a biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response that consisted of an initial small peak that was quickly followed by a second larger peak, which was broader than the first peak. The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt response in PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots after Al3+ treatment occurred earlier than the [Ca2+]cyt response triggered by solvent controls (Figure 5B). In roots expressing PRP3:GCaMP3, Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was larger in amplitude and had a broader peak compared to those observed in UBQ10:GCaMP3- and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots (Figure 5C). The [Ca2+]cyt increases in roots expressing GCaMP3 in interior root tissues were less than roots expressing GCaMP3 in the surface tissues. Among the three lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the interior cell types, the columella-specific GCaMP3 line did not show an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt peak (Figure 5F). The PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed a biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response with a distinct first peak followed by a second peak with lower amplitude. Although the amplitude of the [Ca2+]cyt peak induced by application of MS solution was similar to the amplitude of the first Al3+-triggered [Ca2+]cyt peak, the onset of the latter was delayed (Figure 5D). SCR:GCaMP3-expressing roots exhibited an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt response characterized by a broad peak and with a lower amplitude than peaks observed in the root surface- and cortex GCaMP3-expressing lines (Figure 5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca2+]cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM aluminum (Al3+) chloride application.

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–7 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.The final stimulus we used to test the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was salt in the form of NaCl. Na+ is used to regulate the voltage equilibrium in cells, but also has direct effects on the efflux of K+ into the cytosol [30]. Ca2+ is a regulator for the K+ efflux channels [30], so disruption of K+ into the cytosol may cause variation in the resting concentration of Ca2+. In roots expressing the fluorescent-based [Ca2+]cyt sensor Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60), NaCl treatment resulted in cell-specific [Ca2+]cyt transients in the early elongation zone [31]. Consistent with the results of Feng et al. (2018) [31], roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 exhibited late-onset [Ca2+]cyt transients (i.e., >10 min) in cells of the elongation zone (Figure 6A; supplementary video 2). These NaCl-triggered [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the cell-targeted GCaMP3 lines except for the endodermis-localized GCaMP3 line (Figure 6A–D). In certain lines, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients occurred much earlier after NaCl application when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was fastest in roots of PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines followed by PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the columella were only observed several minutes after NaCl application (i.e., 12 min after NaCl application; Figure 6C). Figure 6.

Modification of Growth Conditions and Chemical Application Methods to Mitigate Solvent Control-Induced [Ca2+]cyt Transients As shown in the preceding sections, the 0.5X MS control solution induced [Ca2+]cyt changes in UBQ10:GCaMP3 and lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Although the MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these first experiments were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: (1) using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and (2) pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modifications in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude. Compared to the datasets shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, the [Ca2+]cyt transients triggered by the MS solution were significantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments (Figure 7). The dampened MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added benefit of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modified growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca2+]cyt increases shown in Figure 3. Despite the lower ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients, these [Ca2+]cyt responses were better separated from the [Ca2+]cyt responses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex (Figure 7). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca2+]cyt response to ATP:MS for UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines had broader peaks than those shown in Figure 3. For PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines, the [Ca2+]cyt response was markedly different from the initial ATP treatment (Figure 3C and Figure 7C). Application of ATP after 0.5X MS adaptation caused a strong, monophasic response earlier than either UBQ10:GCaMP3 or PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Lines expressing PEP:GCaMP3 showed a continued elevated [Ca2+]cyt response that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to either UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines or the previous ATP treatment (Figure 3D and Figure 7D). For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3, the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak (Figure 3E,F and Figure 7E,F). After the cell-type specific lines were adapted to the 0.5× MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment (Table 1). Figure 7.

Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the different chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ showed similar responses (except ATHB8:GCaMP3 to Al3+) while adapted ATP:MS showed significantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate (Table 1). However, with such a small sample size, statistical significance may indicate a trend rather than actual significance. NaCl reaction time was not included due to the large variation in responses across each line. 2.4. Evaluation of [Ca2+]cyt Signatures from Similar Root Development Regions and Cell Types In comparing UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with the other cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines, a ROI was selected and the average of normalized fluorescence intensity was plotted. For the most part, the ROI in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was from the root epidermis and the average normalized fluorescence intensity from this ROI was compared with that of individual or groups of cells from the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. This process did not enable direct comparisons of [Ca2+]cyt signatures between the same cell types or root developmental regions. To address this issue, we conducted another set of imaging experiments using ATP-treated UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For these experiments, a more direct comparison was conducted by drawing ROIs in epidermal cells from similar positions along the root longitudinal axis encompassing the meristem, distal elongation zone, and central elongation zone (Figure 8A). In doing so, we found similarities and differences in [Ca2+]cyt signatures between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For example, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures of UBQ10:GCaMP3 in all root developmental regions were identical to those in the distal and central elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. In PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, however, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature had a much greater amplitude in the meristem (Figure 8A,B). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Direct comparison of ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures in equivalent root developmental regions between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the meristem, distal elongation zone (DEZ), and central elongation zone (CEZ) in UBQ10:GCaMP3 (A) and PIN2:GCaMP3 (B) roots (inset in A).

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3-4 ROI per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.We extended our analysis by drawing ROIs in presumptive columella or endodermis of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and comparing the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures from these ROIs with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. For the columella, we found that ATHB8:GCaMP3 lines displayed an ATP-triggered [Ca2+]cyt signature with a sustained peak throughout the 10 min time course. On the other hand, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature from the presumptive columella region of UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was transient (Figure 8C). For the endodermis, the peak of ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was higher in UBQ10:GCaMP3 when compared to SCR:GCaMP3 (Figure 8D).",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion In this paper, we introduced a set of A. thaliana lines expressing the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 targeted to specific root cell types. Roots of these cell type specific GCaMP3 lines responded to chemical treatments such as ATP, glutamate, Al3+, and NaCl by exhibiting increases in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent CGaMP3 fluorescence. Imaging [Ca2+]cyt changes in cell types in response to some of these chemicals using lines in which genetically-encoded [Ca2+]cyt reporters are expressed ubiquitously have been attempted previously. This was done by drawing a region of interest corresponding to a particular tissue/cell type. For example, it was shown that Al3+-induced biphasic [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the root elongation zone occurred predominantly in the cortex when compared with the epidermis [5]. While this has proven effective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [5,27], specifying a region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for fluorescence-based measurements of [Ca2+]cyt can be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. This problem becomes even more challenging for cell types located in the innermost regions of the root such as the columella and endodermis. Moreover, the ability to consistently draw a region of interest to outline the root cortex requires that the root grew in a particular orientation during the imaging experiments [5]. Here, we documented some of the advantages of the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines by comparing [Ca2+]cyt signatures from ROIs marking presumptive columella and endodermis in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. This analysis revealed stark differences in both the amplitude and shape of [Ca2+]cyt signatures. Differences were also uncovered when equivalent root developmental regions were compared, particularly with regard to the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the meristem (Figure 8). The differences are likely due to contaminating signals from other cell types in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines. The use of cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here could potentially mitigate such problems. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cell type specific lines induced by these various chemicals had various patterns when compared with lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed ubiquitously. A similarity in patterns occurred within the root surface cells’ responses to the different chemical treatments and again within the root inner cell types. Lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in innermost root cell types such as the columella and endodermis generally had slower response times when compared to lines with GCaMP3 expressed in root surface cells. The delayed response times in lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the columella and endodermis was observed in all chemical treatments (Table 1; Figure 6). One could argue that because of the innermost location of the columella and endodermis, the delay in the response times might be due to the longer time it takes for the chemical to make contact with the target cells. The fact that columella and endodermis exhibit minimal or no [Ca2+]cyt increase after application of 0.5X MS supports this possibility. An alternative hypothesis is that the delayed [Ca2+]cyt response in the innermost cell types is due to an inward moving [Ca2+]cyt wave, which is not easily revealed when GCaMP3 is expressed ubiquitously or on the root surface. From our data, these inward-directed [Ca2+]cyt waves appear to be most prominent in ATP- and glutamate-treated roots (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 7). The GCaMP3 lines described here could present a significant tool for better understanding the radial direction of [Ca2+]cyt waves in roots. A meaningful set of experiments with GCaMP3 lines expressed in innermost cell types will be to locally apply a small volume of the chemical stimulus to the root epidermis. The line that was most similar to UBQ10:GCaMP3 with regard to chemical-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was PIN2:GCaMP3. This was not surprising given that the PIN2 promoter drives GCaMP3 expression in root epidermal cells, which is the cell type that is readily imaged in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines due to its location on the root surface. With the PEP:GCaMP3 lines described here, we were able observe biphasic, triphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]cyt signatures after Al3+ treatment that were reminiscent of some of the observations made by Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5] (Figure 5). The cortex- and trichoblast-targeted GCaMP3 lines also revealed an earlier onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines (Figure 6). It has been shown that [Ca2+]cyt transients in roots exposed to NaCl is part of the cellular machinery that prevents root cells from rupturing under salinity stress. The plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase, Feronia (FER), is required for root growth recovery after encountering high salinity conditions [31]. Because fer mutants displayed a high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cortex revealed by the PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines could be a mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. The cell type GCaMP3 lines described here should be useful in testing this hypothesis. While testing the various cell type specific GCaMP3 lines, we encountered a number of technical challenges brought about by our seedling growth conditions. In several experiments, we found that applying the 0.5X MS control solution alone could trigger a rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The MS only-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were most prominent in the UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types (e.g., PIN2:GCaMP3 and PRP3:GCaMP3). The [Ca2+]cyt transients observed after MS treatment were reminiscent of touch-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses [20], and recent studies on ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signaling [27], suggesting that we might have been eliciting a touch response as the various solutions were added to the root. In support of this hypothesis, our method for root [Ca2+]cyt imaging involved planting seed of the reporter lines on a thin layer of agarose to secure the root while at the same time allowing for the root cells to be accessible to the various chemical treatments ([5]; see Methods). It is possible that some of the [Ca2+]cyt transients observed in response to MS application resulted from roots that were not securely anchored to the agarose medium. Alternatively, the prevalence of MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases in some of our experiments could be due to osmotic changes when the solution was applied. Because agar for imaging roots was poured in advance, it was possible that liquid in some of the plates may have evaporated during storage. This could have led to some plates having an MS solution that was more concentrated than the treatment solution. To test the possibility that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt changes were due to touch or hypoosmotic shock, we repeated the ATP application experiments using roots that emerged from seeds planted on plates with freshly prepared MS-supplemented agarose. Furthermore, roots were pretreated with MS solution prior to ATP treatment. Under these modified growth and treatment conditions, we found that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were significantly dampened (Figure 3 and Figure 7). Given that [Ca2+]cyt changes are responses that can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli, the results described here highlight the need to carefully consider the growth and treatment conditions, and to include appropriate controls when conducting [Ca2+]cyt imaging experiments. Based on these observations, it is imperative that fresh plates be prepared prior to planting the reporter lines and that roots be pretreated with the solvent control solution for a few hours to allow seedlings to adapt. Some studies have shown [Ca2+]cyt signals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [5,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation from the apical into the sub-apical can also occur [27]. The cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in which GCaMP3 is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex-, endodermis- and columella-specific lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation within the roots. The MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses in lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cyt increases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cyt changes can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment while those lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca2+]cyt response to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored.",

Copyright notice ID: 7503278 PMID: 32887481 Abstract Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt. Keywords: GCaMP3, Arabidopsis, cell type specificity, calcium response, [Ca2+]cyt1. Introduction Calcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+ acts as a stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and an efflux of stored Ca2+ from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via a concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the cytoplasm [1]. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [1,2,3]. This low concentration is maintained through H+/Ca2+ antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+ into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [3,4]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+ back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [2], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane. Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate a second messenger cascade [4,5]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+ response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+ as a second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-1. When Ca2+ levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to a specific stimulus, these indicator dyes increased fluorescence [6]. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [6,7]. Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of a suite of fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and other marine organisms [8,9]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these fluorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+ binding [8]. Ca2+ binding induced changes in the conformation of fluorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced fluorescence emission. One example of a genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [1,10]. GCaMP3 is a modified form of GCaMP that features a circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP) flanked by CaM and M13 that gives low fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+ to the CaM domain [11]. To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S) and Ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) [12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cyt changes across entire plant organs [5,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique [Ca2+]cyt signature. While [Ca2+]cyt changes typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within specific tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated a set of lines in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, expressing GCaMP3 targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type specific promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cyt changes in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cyt increases in plants.2. Results 2.1. Expression of GCaMP3 in Different Root Cell Types of A. thaliana To the best of our knowledge, plant lines expressing genetically encoded [Ca2+]cyt sensors that are available to the scientific community are driven by constitutive promoters. A. thaliana lines expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct, which we generated and used previously to study [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in root hairs [17], is one example. In addition to root hairs, GCaMP3 fluorescence was detected in all cell-types of the primary root of A. thaliana expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct (Figure 1). Using confocal microscopy, strong fluorescence was observed in cells located at the root surface, such as the peripheral root cap and epidermis (Figure 1A,B,D). Moderate levels of fluorescence could also be detected in the underlying cortex (Figure 1C). However, in cells located deeper within the root, such as the columella and endodermis, fluorescence was obscured by the fluorescence from surface cells (Figure 1A,B). Figure 1.

Scale bar: 50 μm.This prompted us to generate a set of constructs that drive GCaMP3 expression in specific root cell types. For this purpose, we used promoters described in the SWELL promoter collection including ATHB8 (columella), SCARECROW (SCR, endodermis), Pin-Formed 2 (PIN2, epidermis and cortex), PEP (cortex), and Proline rich protein 3(PRP3, trichoblasts) [16]. For the five constructs, we found that GCaMP3 signal was most prominent in the expected cell types (Figure 2). For example, ATHB8 and SCR promoters drove strong GCaMP3 expression in the columella and endodermis, respectively (Figure 2A,B). For ATHB8:GCaMP3-expressing lines, we also observed weak fluorescence in the peripheral cap cells and the stele. For SCR:GCaMP3, fluorescence in the endodermis was observed in all root developmental zones from the meristem and elongation zone, continuing into the maturation zone. Roots of PEP:GCaMP3- and PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings also showed fluorescence in the expected cell types (i.e., cortex and trichoblast, respectively) (Figure 2C,D). On the other hand, fluorescence was detected in the epidermis and cortex of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines, consistent with observations of Marques-Bueno et al. (2016) [16] (Figure 2E). Figure 2.

Scale bar: 50 μm.2.2. Chemical Treatments of Cell-Type Specific GCaMP3 Constructs Studies on Ca2+ signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cyt including cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [5,18,19,20,21,22,23]. We used some of these known [Ca2+]cyt triggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell-specific GCaMP3 lines. We first analyzed the response of the GCaMP3 lines to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (Figure 3). In mammalian systems, ATP is a neurotransmitter that is perceived by plasma membrane bound purinergic receptors, and its signaling role is facilitated through increases in [Ca2+]cyt [24]. While plants do not have the canonical purinergic receptors found in mammals, they perceive ATP via lectin receptor-like kinases and, similar to mammals, ATP elicits a rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt [25,26,27]. Comparable to previous reports, application of ATP to the elongation zone of roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 elicited a rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent fluorescence followed by a gradual decline (Figure 3A) [5,25]. To determine if the increase in [Ca2+]cyt was due exclusively to ATP, we applied the solvent control solution, which consisted of 0.5× Murashige Skoog (MS) solution without ATP to roots. We found that applying MS solution triggered a rise in [Ca2+]cyt that was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to the [Ca2+]cyt change caused by ATP (Figure 3A). This observation suggests that under our growing conditions, adding a drop of solvent control solution to the root can induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt, which could be the result of a touch or hypoosmotic response [19,20,27,28]. Therefore, in testing the cell-type GCaMP3 lines, we included solvent control applications in all of the experiments so we could tease apart [Ca2+]cyt changes due to the desired stimulus from those resulting from a touch or hypoosmotic response.

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–6 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.Upon applying ATP to roots expressing cell-specific GCaMP3 lines, we found similarities and differences in the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures. For example, the PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, which expressed GCaMP3 in the epidermis and cortex (Figure 2), displayed similar [Ca2+]cyt signatures as UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines in response to ATP and the solvent control solution (Figure 3A,B). This is not surprising given that GCaMP3 is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of the UBQ10 and PIN2 promoters (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered a small increase in [Ca2+]cyt that had similar patterns (Figure 3C). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in cells located in the root interior such as the cortex, endodermis, and columella (supplementary video 1), ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases resembled the patterns of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines. However, the [Ca2+]cyt increases triggered by application of MS control solution were not as prominent in these lines when compared to those lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the epidermis (Figure 3D–F). The next chemical we used to test the cell-specific GCaMP3 lines was glutamic acid (Figure 4). Like ATP, glutamic acid (glutamate) is a neurotransmitter in mammalian cells that can trigger a [Ca2+]cyt increase [5,14]. Application of glutamate to the elongation zone of roots expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct induced a strong initial [Ca2+]cyt increase with a quick return to equilibrium (Figure 4A). The [Ca2+]cyt spikes induced by application of MS controls were also observed in this dataset. Compared to glutamate, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt increase was delayed in roots treated with MS solution. In this case, however, the [Ca2+]cyt spikes triggered by glutamate and the MS control solution were similar in amplitude (Figure 4A). Like the ATP treatment, [Ca2+]cyt response of roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 to glutamate was similar to roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3. Furthermore, [Ca2+]cyt changes in the root elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings in response to the MS control solution was delayed, but exhibited a lower amplitude (Figure 4B). Lines expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 also had a strong initial [Ca2+]cyt peak after glutamate treatment with a rapid return to equilibrium that resembled UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Like UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, application of MS control solution elicited a [Ca2+]cyt response that was delayed when compared to glutamate exposure (Figure 4C). By contrast, PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed a dampened response to glutamate compared to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the root surface (Figure 4D). Close examination of the time course of [Ca2+]cyt signals in the cortex after glutamate application revealed a triphasic response, with two larger peaks and a delayed smaller peak. Surprisingly, the amplitude of glutamate-triggered [Ca2+]cyt increases in the cortex was less than that of MS treated roots (Figure 4D). The lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 and ATHB8:GCaMP3 showed monophasic responses to glutamate with a gradual return to equilibrium, similar to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cells. Furthermore, unlike lines with GCaMP expressed in the cortex and root surface cells, the MS control solution response for endodermis- and columella- targeted GCaMP3 had delayed responses and lower amplitudes (Figure 4E,F). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca2+]cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM glutamate (Glu) application.

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–4 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.The third chemical we tested against the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was Al3+ in the form of aluminum chloride (Figure 5). Al3+ is a toxic tri-valent cation that competes with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ to increase the activity of Ca2+-ATPases while disrupting transport of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane [5,29]. Similar to previous treatments, the root elongation zone of seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 showed a monophasic [Ca2+]cyt response to Al3+ (Figure 5A). The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to ATP, glutamate and solvent control application (Figure 3A, Figure 4A and Figure 5A) [5]. In roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3, Al3+ application elicited a biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response that consisted of an initial small peak that was quickly followed by a second larger peak, which was broader than the first peak. The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt response in PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots after Al3+ treatment occurred earlier than the [Ca2+]cyt response triggered by solvent controls (Figure 5B). In roots expressing PRP3:GCaMP3, Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was larger in amplitude and had a broader peak compared to those observed in UBQ10:GCaMP3- and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots (Figure 5C). The [Ca2+]cyt increases in roots expressing GCaMP3 in interior root tissues were less than roots expressing GCaMP3 in the surface tissues. Among the three lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the interior cell types, the columella-specific GCaMP3 line did not show an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt peak (Figure 5F). The PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed a biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response with a distinct first peak followed by a second peak with lower amplitude. Although the amplitude of the [Ca2+]cyt peak induced by application of MS solution was similar to the amplitude of the first Al3+-triggered [Ca2+]cyt peak, the onset of the latter was delayed (Figure 5D). SCR:GCaMP3-expressing roots exhibited an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt response characterized by a broad peak and with a lower amplitude than peaks observed in the root surface- and cortex GCaMP3-expressing lines (Figure 5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Time course of [Ca2+]cyt changes in A. thaliana roots after 1 mM aluminum (Al3+) chloride application.

(A–F) Quantification of [Ca2+]cyt-dependent fluorescence of various lines expressing GCaMP3 after Al3+ and solvent control (0.5× MS) application. Black arrows indicate the time of treatment. Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3–7 regions of interest (ROI) per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.The final stimulus we used to test the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines was salt in the form of NaCl. Na+ is used to regulate the voltage equilibrium in cells, but also has direct effects on the efflux of K+ into the cytosol [30]. Ca2+ is a regulator for the K+ efflux channels [30], so disruption of K+ into the cytosol may cause variation in the resting concentration of Ca2+. In roots expressing the fluorescent-based [Ca2+]cyt sensor Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60), NaCl treatment resulted in cell-specific [Ca2+]cyt transients in the early elongation zone [31]. Consistent with the results of Feng et al. (2018) [31], roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 exhibited late-onset [Ca2+]cyt transients (i.e., >10 min) in cells of the elongation zone (Figure 6A; supplementary video 2). These NaCl-triggered [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the cell-targeted GCaMP3 lines except for the endodermis-localized GCaMP3 line (Figure 6A–D). In certain lines, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients occurred much earlier after NaCl application when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was fastest in roots of PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines followed by PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the columella were only observed several minutes after NaCl application (i.e., 12 min after NaCl application; Figure 6C). Figure 6.

Modification of Growth Conditions and Chemical Application Methods to Mitigate Solvent Control-Induced [Ca2+]cyt Transients As shown in the preceding sections, the 0.5X MS control solution induced [Ca2+]cyt changes in UBQ10:GCaMP3 and lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Although the MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these first experiments were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: (1) using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and (2) pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modifications in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude. Compared to the datasets shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, the [Ca2+]cyt transients triggered by the MS solution were significantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments (Figure 7). The dampened MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added benefit of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modified growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca2+]cyt increases shown in Figure 3. Despite the lower ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients, these [Ca2+]cyt responses were better separated from the [Ca2+]cyt responses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex (Figure 7). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca2+]cyt response to ATP:MS for UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines had broader peaks than those shown in Figure 3. For PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines, the [Ca2+]cyt response was markedly different from the initial ATP treatment (Figure 3C and Figure 7C). Application of ATP after 0.5X MS adaptation caused a strong, monophasic response earlier than either UBQ10:GCaMP3 or PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Lines expressing PEP:GCaMP3 showed a continued elevated [Ca2+]cyt response that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to either UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines or the previous ATP treatment (Figure 3D and Figure 7D). For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3, the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak (Figure 3E,F and Figure 7E,F). After the cell-type specific lines were adapted to the 0.5× MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment (Table 1). Figure 7.

Statistical analysis using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post-Hoc test (p ≤ 0.05 for reported significance) was performed for differences in chemical treatments only due to the lack of comparable ROI sections between cell-type lines.

Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the different chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ showed similar responses (except ATHB8:GCaMP3 to Al3+) while adapted ATP:MS showed significantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate (Table 1). However, with such a small sample size, statistical significance may indicate a trend rather than actual significance. NaCl reaction time was not included due to the large variation in responses across each line.2.4. Evaluation of [Ca2+]cyt Signatures from Similar Root Development Regions and Cell Types In comparing UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with the other cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines, a ROI was selected and the average of normalized fluorescence intensity was plotted. For the most part, the ROI in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was from the root epidermis and the average normalized fluorescence intensity from this ROI was compared with that of individual or groups of cells from the cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. This process did not enable direct comparisons of [Ca2+]cyt signatures between the same cell types or root developmental regions. To address this issue, we conducted another set of imaging experiments using ATP-treated UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For these experiments, a more direct comparison was conducted by drawing ROIs in epidermal cells from similar positions along the root longitudinal axis encompassing the meristem, distal elongation zone, and central elongation zone (Figure 8A). In doing so, we found similarities and differences in [Ca2+]cyt signatures between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For example, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures of UBQ10:GCaMP3 in all root developmental regions were identical to those in the distal and central elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. In PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, however, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature had a much greater amplitude in the meristem (Figure 8A,B). Figure 8. Open in a new tab Direct comparison of ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures in equivalent root developmental regions between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and cell-type specific GCaMP3 lines. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the meristem, distal elongation zone (DEZ), and central elongation zone (CEZ) in UBQ10:GCaMP3 (A) and PIN2:GCaMP3 (B) roots (inset in A).

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3-4 ROI per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value.We extended our analysis by drawing ROIs in presumptive columella or endodermis of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and comparing the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures from these ROIs with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. For the columella, we found that ATHB8:GCaMP3 lines displayed an ATP-triggered [Ca2+]cyt signature with a sustained peak throughout the 10 min time course. On the other hand, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature from the presumptive columella region of UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was transient (Figure 8C). For the endodermis, the peak of ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was higher in UBQ10:GCaMP3 when compared to SCR:GCaMP3 (Figure 8D).3. Discussion In this paper, we introduced a set of A. thaliana lines expressing the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 targeted to specific root cell types. Roots of these cell type specific GCaMP3 lines responded to chemical treatments such as ATP, glutamate, Al3+, and NaCl by exhibiting increases in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent CGaMP3 fluorescence. Imaging [Ca2+]cyt changes in cell types in response to some of these chemicals using lines in which genetically-encoded [Ca2+]cyt reporters are expressed ubiquitously have been attempted previously. This was done by drawing a region of interest corresponding to a particular tissue/cell type. For example, it was shown that Al3+-induced biphasic [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the root elongation zone occurred predominantly in the cortex when compared with the epidermis [5]. While this has proven effective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [5,27], specifying a region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for fluorescence-based measurements of [Ca2+]cyt can be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. This problem becomes even more challenging for cell types located in the innermost regions of the root such as the columella and endodermis. Moreover, the ability to consistently draw a region of interest to outline the root cortex requires that the root grew in a particular orientation during the imaging experiments [5]. Here, we documented some of the advantages of the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines by comparing [Ca2+]cyt signatures from ROIs marking presumptive columella and endodermis in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. This analysis revealed stark differences in both the amplitude and shape of [Ca2+]cyt signatures. Differences were also uncovered when equivalent root developmental regions were compared, particularly with regard to the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the meristem (Figure 8). The differences are likely due to contaminating signals from other cell types in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines. The use of cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here could potentially mitigate such problems. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cell type specific lines induced by these various chemicals had various patterns when compared with lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed ubiquitously. A similarity in patterns occurred within the root surface cells’ responses to the different chemical treatments and again within the root inner cell types. Lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in innermost root cell types such as the columella and endodermis generally had slower response times when compared to lines with GCaMP3 expressed in root surface cells. The delayed response times in lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the columella and endodermis was observed in all chemical treatments (Table 1; Figure 6). One could argue that because of the innermost location of the columella and endodermis, the delay in the response times might be due to the longer time it takes for the chemical to make contact with the target cells. The fact that columella and endodermis exhibit minimal or no [Ca2+]cyt increase after application of 0.5X MS supports this possibility. An alternative hypothesis is that the delayed [Ca2+]cyt response in the innermost cell types is due to an inward moving [Ca2+]cyt wave, which is not easily revealed when GCaMP3 is expressed ubiquitously or on the root surface. From our data, these inward-directed [Ca2+]cyt waves appear to be most prominent in ATP- and glutamate-treated roots (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 7). The GCaMP3 lines described here could present a significant tool for better understanding the radial direction of [Ca2+]cyt waves in roots. A meaningful set of experiments with GCaMP3 lines expressed in innermost cell types will be to locally apply a small volume of the chemical stimulus to the root epidermis. The line that was most similar to UBQ10:GCaMP3 with regard to chemical-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was PIN2:GCaMP3. This was not surprising given that the PIN2 promoter drives GCaMP3 expression in root epidermal cells, which is the cell type that is readily imaged in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines due to its location on the root surface. With the PEP:GCaMP3 lines described here, we were able observe biphasic, triphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]cyt signatures after Al3+ treatment that were reminiscent of some of the observations made by Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5] (Figure 5). The cortex- and trichoblast-targeted GCaMP3 lines also revealed an earlier onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines (Figure 6). It has been shown that [Ca2+]cyt transients in roots exposed to NaCl is part of the cellular machinery that prevents root cells from rupturing under salinity stress. The plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase, Feronia (FER), is required for root growth recovery after encountering high salinity conditions [31]. Because fer mutants displayed a high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cortex revealed by the PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines could be a mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. The cell type GCaMP3 lines described here should be useful in testing this hypothesis. While testing the various cell type specific GCaMP3 lines, we encountered a number of technical challenges brought about by our seedling growth conditions. In several experiments, we found that applying the 0.5X MS control solution alone could trigger a rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The MS only-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were most prominent in the UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types (e.g., PIN2:GCaMP3 and PRP3:GCaMP3). The [Ca2+]cyt transients observed after MS treatment were reminiscent of touch-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses [20], and recent studies on ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signaling [27], suggesting that we might have been eliciting a touch response as the various solutions were added to the root. In support of this hypothesis, our method for root [Ca2+]cyt imaging involved planting seed of the reporter lines on a thin layer of agarose to secure the root while at the same time allowing for the root cells to be accessible to the various chemical treatments ([5]; see Methods). It is possible that some of the [Ca2+]cyt transients observed in response to MS application resulted from roots that were not securely anchored to the agarose medium. Alternatively, the prevalence of MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases in some of our experiments could be due to osmotic changes when the solution was applied. Because agar for imaging roots was poured in advance, it was possible that liquid in some of the plates may have evaporated during storage. This could have led to some plates having an MS solution that was more concentrated than the treatment solution. To test the possibility that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt changes were due to touch or hypoosmotic shock, we repeated the ATP application experiments using roots that emerged from seeds planted on plates with freshly prepared MS-supplemented agarose. Furthermore, roots were pretreated with MS solution prior to ATP treatment. Under these modified growth and treatment conditions, we found that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were significantly dampened (Figure 3 and Figure 7). Given that [Ca2+]cyt changes are responses that can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli, the results described here highlight the need to carefully consider the growth and treatment conditions, and to include appropriate controls when conducting [Ca2+]cyt imaging experiments. Based on these observations, it is imperative that fresh plates be prepared prior to planting the reporter lines and that roots be pretreated with the solvent control solution for a few hours to allow seedlings to adapt. Some studies have shown [Ca2+]cyt signals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [5,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation from the apical into the sub-apical can also occur [27]. The cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in which GCaMP3 is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex-, endodermis- and columella-specific lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation within the roots. The MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses in lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cyt increases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cyt changes can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment while those lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca2+]cyt response to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Generation of Cell-Type Specific Promoter GCaMP Lines Each promoter was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table S1). The sequence preceding the start codon for each gene was used in each instance. The resulting fragments were digested with PstI and SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector [32]. GCaMP3 was amplified from plasmid DNA and digested with XmaI and BstEII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and then cloned behind each promoter construct in pCAMBIA1390. To generate UBQ10:GCaMP3, a similar approach was taken. GCaMP3 was again amplified from plasmid DNA and then digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA; http://neb.com) and cloned behind the Ubiquitin 10 promoter in a previously described pCAMIA1390 vector [33]. Plasmid containing GCaMP3 was a gift from Loren Looger (Addgene plasmid # 22692; http://n2t.net/addgene:22692; RRID:Addgene_22692; [34]). Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the floral dip method was used to generate Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants expressing the GCaMP3 constructs [35]. All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2.4.2. Preparation of A. thaliana Seedlings for Imaging Seeds of the various A. thaliana GCaMP3 lines were planted on coverslips coated with a thin layer of MS-supplemented low-melting agarose. This set-up was prepared by pouring 3 mL of autoclaved 0.5% low-melting agarose in 0.5X MS solution (pH 5.7) on 48 × 60 mm No. 1 coverslips (Thermo Scientific, gold seal cover glass reorder no. 3334, Waltham, MA, USA; www.thermoscientific.com) as described in Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5]. Coverslips with polymerized agarose were placed in 9 cm diameter round Petri dishes and stored at 4 °C prior to planting seeds. In another set of experiments, seeds were planted as soon as the agarose polymerized. Petri dishes and coverslips with the planted seeds were kept in 4 °C for 2 days and transferred to a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, MB, Canada) set to 24 °C with 14 h/10 h day/night cycle. Petri dishes with the coverslips were kept vertical to enable the roots to grow down and straight along the surface of the agarose. Seedlings were imaged when primary roots were about 3–4 cm long, which was 5–6 days after transfer to the Conviron.4.3. Validation of GCaMP3 Expression in Root Cell Types Validation of GCaMP3 expression in the target root cell types was conducted with an inverted Leica TCS SP8-X Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany; http://leica-microsystems.com). Seedlings from the Conviron were secured in a horizontal orientation on the stage of the microscope. Seedling roots were illuminated with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser using a 40× (numerical aperture 1.1) water immersion objective and emitted light detected at 510 nm. For some lines, single optical images were acquired at a pixel resolution of 1024 × 1024. For other lines, a Z-series was acquired by capturing 81 images at 0.4 µm intervals and 3-D images were generated using the LAS visualization software of the Leica confocal microscope.4.4. Chemical Treatments and Measurement of Ca2+-Dependent GCaMP3 Fluorescence Stock solutions of 1 M ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; A7699-1G), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; G1149-100G), aluminum chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas. No. 7784-13-6) and sodium chloride (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; 3624-19) were made with deionized water and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Working solutions of 1 mM Al3+, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM Glu, and 150 mM NaCl were made by adding the appropriate volume of the stock solution in 0.5X MS at pH 5.7. Working solutions were made fresh prior to the imaging experiments. To measure [Ca2+]cyt-dependent GCaMP3 fluorescence, images of growing roots were acquired every 1 s for 10 to 15 min using the Leica SP8-X confocal microscope. Images were captured at a scanning speed of 600 MHz and pixel resolution of 512 × 300. Baseline GCaMP3 fluorescence of the roots was first acquired for 1 min after placing seedlings on the stage of the microscope. Twenty µL of the treatment solution was then added on top of the agarose medium where the root was growing using an adjustable volume pipette while imaging continued. From the collected images, the average fluorescence intensity was acquired by marking a rectangular region of interest corresponding to the specific cell type using the rectangular selection tool of the SPX-8 LAS software. GCaMP3 fluorescence (F) values were normalized using the formula I= F−F0F0 where F is the fluorescence intensity at some time point and F0 is the lowest fluorescence intensity point for the data set. Normalized fluorescence values were reported as the mean ± SE of at least three independent seedlings per GCaMP3 construct [36]. Another round of intensity video imaging was taken for the 0.5× MS control solution to generate the MS control fluorescence curves.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/17/6385/s1, Supplementary video 1 Time lapse video of [Ca2+]cyt changes in the columella cells of ATHB8:GCaMP3 lines in response to ATP.

    "abstract": "SPIRRIG and SCAR/WAVE are molecular determinants of actin-mediated root hair development in Arabidopsis.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth, a process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves a balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi compartments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a). Open in a new tab Root epidermal cells called trichoblasts are the cell types that form root hairs. Work in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that trichoblasts are specified to become root hair-forming cells early during root development through the patterned assembly of protein complexes of transcriptional activators and repressors in different cell files (Schiefelbein et al., 2014; Shibata et al., 2018). Upon establishing their identity, trichoblasts undergo two developmental stages that lead to root hair outgrowth. The first stage is the establishment of a root hair initiation domain (RHID) that eventually leads to a conspicuous root hair bulge at the basal (root-tip oriented) end of the trichoblast (Grierson et al., 2014; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). Several proteins accumulate at the RHID, most prominently, the Rho of Plants (ROP) small GTPases and their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activators (Denninger et al., 2019). The second stage is tip growth. In addition to small GTPases, the cytoskeleton, the endomembrane trafficking machinery, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide lipids, hormones (e.g. auxin and ethylene), and reactive oxygen species are other major players in signaling pathways that modulate root hair development (Bascom et al., 2018a; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). The filamentous-actin (F-actin) and microtubule cytoskeletons orchestrate root hair development. The actin cytoskeleton in particular has been studied widely during tip growth, as it functions as tracks for the trafficking of cellular cargo to the cell apex (Stephan, 2017; Bascom et al., 2018a; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). Many insights into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in tip growth have been demonstrated through work with Arabidopsis mutants and pharmacological approaches involving the use of chemicals that disrupt F-actin. For example, the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B (LatB) inhibits tip growth, while also inducing the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes with irregular shapes (Bibikova et al., 1999; Gibbon et al., 1999). In this regard, Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the root hair-expressed vegetative ACTIN2 (ACT2) gene are characterized by root hairs that mirror those treated with LatB (Ringli et al., 2002; Yoo et al., 2012). Furthermore, ACT2 and ACT7 mutants display an apical (shoot-ward) shift in the position of the RHID compared to the wild-type (Kiefer et al., 2015). To fulfill its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton is organized into higher order networks that correspond to the growth strategy of the cell. This is evident in tip-growing cells, whereby the base and shank of the cell consist mostly of thick, longitudinal F-actin bundles, while the apex contains actin fringes, rings, patches, or a fine meshwork, depending on the plant species or cell type (Stephan, 2017). To sustain tip growth, the integrity and organization of these tip-focused F-actin arrays must be maintained, a task facilitated by a diverse collection of actin-binding proteins and actin nucleators (Li et al., 2015; Paez-Garcia, 2018; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). The actin-related protein (ARP2/3) complex and its activator, suppressor of cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex (W/SC), is one of the most well-characterized actin nucleators in plants (Deeks and Hussey, 2005; Szymanski, 2005; Yanagisawa et al., 2013). Upon conversion from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation, the ARP2/3 complex promotes F-actin nucleation from the sides of existing filaments by forming a surface that mimics stable actin dimers (Blanchoin et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2001; Rodal et al., 2005). Activation of ARP2/3 for efficient nucleation of F-actin requires the W/SC nucleation promoting factor (NPF) complex. In addition to W/SC, the NPF consists of the proteins SRA1, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC300/BRICK1 (BRK1) (Basu et al., 2004, 2005; El-Assal et al., 2004; Djakovic et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005b, 2008; Jörgens et al., 2010). Studies of Arabidopsis trichome development have been most instrumental in revealing insights into the function of W/SC-ARP2/3 in plants. Plant counterparts to the mammalian W/SC-ARP2/3 subunits were first uncovered through the cloning of disrupted genes in a set of DISTORTED (DIS) Arabidopsis trichome mutants (Hülskamp et al., 1994; Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2004; Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005a). W/SC is the only known NPF for ARP2/3, and BRK1 and SCAR mutants display null arp2/3 trichome phenotypes (Le et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). In addition to trichome development, the W/SC-ARP2/3 actin filament-nucleating module has been implicated in specifying leaf pavement cell shape, light and auxin-dependent root growth, stomatal gating, gravitropism, responses to salinity stress, and plant immunity (Li et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005a; Dyachok et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2016; Isner et al., 2017; Pratap Sahi et al., 2018; Badet et al., 2019). The W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have been shown to play essential roles in some tip growing cells, such as the protonemal cells of the moss Physcomitrium (formerly Physcomitrella) patens. This was shown when RNA interference of transcripts encoding selected subunits of the moss W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes resulted in substantial protonemal tip growth defects (Harries et al., 2005; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006; Finka et al., 2008). The importance of the W/SC andARP2/3 complexes was further demonstrated by Perroud and Quatrano (2006, 2008), who showed that two of its components, BRK1 and ARPC4, accumulated in tips of moss protonemal cells. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants with mutations in components of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes displayed minimal or no defects in root hair or pollen tube growth (Li et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003), and none of the subunits have been conclusively shown to exhibit clear polar localization in these cell types. Therefore, the extent by which the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes function in tip growing cells of plants remains to be determined. SPIRRIG (SPI) is one of eight genes that has been considered to be a member of the DIS group, but compared to other DIS mutants, the trichome phenotypes of spi are less severe and the mutant does not display early stage cell swelling that is diagnostic of the DIS group (Schwab et al., 2003). SPI was shown to encode a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo and concanavalin A-like lectin domains and C-terminally located pleckstrin homology, beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH), and WD40 repeat domains (Saedler et al., 2009). BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis, and receptor signaling. This family of proteins is of clinical importance as they have been implicated in a variety of human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmunity syndrome, and autism (Cullinane et al., 2013). In addition to mild trichome defects, Arabidopsis SPI mutants have short root hairs characterized by fragmented vacuoles, suggesting that SPI, like other eukaryotic BEACH domain-containing proteins, functions in membrane trafficking (Saedler et al., 2009). Additionally, Steffens et al. (2017) showed that SPI physically interacts with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, reinforcing its role in membrane remodeling. SPI was also demonstrated to localize to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis epidermal cells, thereby suggesting a novel role for SPI in post-transcriptional regulation (Steffens et al., 2015). Because SPI had a substantial but incomplete overlap with distorted mutant phenotypes, it was suggested that SPI might be involved in actin-mediated cell developmental processes (Saedler et al., 2009), and perhaps function in coordination with W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes. However, SPI is not a known W/SC or ARP2/3 subunit; therefore, its relationship to ARP2/3 function is unclear. Moreover, the uncertainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype when SPI is mutated, remains unknown. In the current study, we addressed these questions by generating a fully functional SPI fluorescent protein fusion and documented its spatial and temporal localization during root hair development. In addition, we used live cell microscopy to simultaneously image the dynamics of SPI and W/SC and correlate SPI localization with root hair tip-focused F-actin. Taken together, our results point to potential functional relationships among SPI, W/SC, and actin during root hair development.",

    "results": "Results Isolation of a new SPIRRIG mutant allele We previously described a forward genetic screen that led to the isolation of three nonallelic recessive Arabidopsis mutants that were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of LatB. The hypersensitive to LatB1 (hlb1) and hlb3 mutants have been described previously (Sparks et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). hlb1 was disrupted in a gene encoding a trans-Golgi network-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in actin-mediated membrane recycling (Sparks et al., 2016), whereas the genetic lesion in hlb3 was found to encode the class II actin nucleator formin (Sun et al., 2019). Here, we report on hlb2, the third of these recessive mutants. Like hlb1 and hlb3, primary root growth was more severely inhibited by LatB in hlb2 compared to the wild-type. In the absence of LatB or at low (i.e. 25 nM) LatB concentrations, the primary root length of hlb2 was similar to the wild-type. Differences in root length between wild-type and hlb2 became apparent when seedlings were grown on a concentration of 50-nM LatB and higher (Supplemental Figure S1, A–C). Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 was confined to a region between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that hlb2 had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position: 720,152–720,161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. This 10-base pair deletion led to an open-reading frame shift at the Asp1526 codon, resulting in a truncated protein (Supplemental Figure S2A). AT1G03060 encodes the BEACH domain-containing protein SPI (Saedler et al., 2009; Supplemental Figure S2A). Because the first spi mutant alleles were reported to have short root hairs (Saedler et al., 2009), we examined root hairs of hlb2. The growth rate of hlb2 root hairs was approximately 70% slower than the wild-type, with some root hairs forming only small bulges (Supplemental Figure S2, B and C). Moreover, hlb2 had mild trichome defects that were reminiscent of the phenotypes of previously isolated spi mutant alleles (Supplemental Figure S2D; Saedler et al., 2009). To further verify if HLB2 is SPI, we obtained a mutant from the publicly available SALK collection (SALK_065311), which had a T-DNA insertion in the 10th exon of the SPI gene (Supplemental Figure S2A; Alonso et al., 2003). The SALK_065311 line we obtained is the same as the spi-3 mutant allele reported previously in Steffens et al. (2015). In addition to having similar root hair and trichome defects to hlb2, primary roots of spi-3 were hypersensitive to LatB (Supplemental Figure S2E), and a cross between hlb2 and SALK_065311 failed to complement each other in the F1 hybrid. Taken together, these results indicate that hlb2 is a new spi mutant allele. Based on earlier nomenclature (Steffens et al., 2015), we renamed hlb2 as spi-5 (Supplemental Figure S2A). The spi-5 mutant allele was used for all subsequent experiments. SPIRRIG localizes to the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs SPI fluorescent protein fusions were previously demonstrated to associate with P-bodies and endosomes (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). However, these constructs have not been shown to complement the defective root hair and trichome phenotypes of spi. Due to the large size of SPI, we were unable to generate native promoter-driven fluorescent protein fusions to the full-length SPI complementary DNA or genomic DNA. To overcome this problem, SPI was tagged with the 3x-Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) for energy transfer (YPet; Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) using a method called recombineering. This method involves tagging the gene of interest in the context of transformation-competent bacterial artificial chromosomes to ensure that all regulatory sequences are included in the fluorescent protein fusion (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). Once spi was transformed with a recombineered SPI-YPet construct, primary root hypersensitivity to LatB, short root hairs, and defective trichome phenotypes were rescued, indicating that the construct was functional (Figure 1A;Supplemental Figure S3). Transgenic complementation of spi with SPI-YPet provided additional evidence that HLB2 is SPI. Confocal microscopy of more than 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings revealed that SPI-YPet signal was strongest in the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs (Figure 1, B and C; (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). Low magnification time-lapse movies showed that 100% of rapidly elongating root hairs had robust SPI-YPet signal at the tips (Supplemental Movie S1). Weak or no SPI-YPet fluorescence was detected at the RHID and during early root hair bulge formation, but the signal intensified as the root hairs transitioned to tip growth (Figure 1C;Supplemental Movie S3). SPI-YPet signal dissipated as the root hairs matured and the tip growth rate declined (Figure 1, B and C; Supplemental Movie S4). A linear regression analysis showed that the intensity of SPI-YPet fluorescence in root hair tips is significantly positively correlated to rapid root hair growth (Figure 1D). These results indicate that the SPI protein has functions related to root hair elongation, which is consistent with the short root hair phenotypes of spi. Figure 1.

Faint SPI-YPet signal is found in bulging root hairs or those that have stopped elongating (arrowheads). Images are representative of approximately 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings. Bar = 10 µm. D, Scatter plot showing correlation analysis of root hair tip SPI-YPet fluorescence and root hair tip growth. The mean fluorescence in the oval in region 1 divided by the oval in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio in the Y-axis. Line shows linear regression fit with R2 value = 0.308 and P = 1.72 × 10−5 (n=5–7 root hairs per time point) SPIRRIG is transported to the root hair tip via post-Golgi compartments The prominent SPI-YPet signal at the tips of elongating root hairs is reminiscent of the localization patterns of post-Golgi markers such as RAB small GTPases, which are known to function in tip-directed secretion (Preuss et al., 2004). We therefore hypothesized that SPI is trafficked to the tips of root hairs via post-Golgi compartments. To test this hypothesis, we treated seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with Brefeldin A (BFA). BFA is a fungal toxin that is routinely used to investigate endomembrane dynamics because it prevents vesicle formation for exocytosis by inhibiting ADP ribosylation factor GEFs (ARF-GEFs), while still enabling endocytosis and some retrograde pathways to continue (Baluška, 2002, Doyle et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis roots, BFA binds to the ARF-GEF GNOM, which is localized to early endosomes in the endocytic pathway, and possibly also in the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Robinson et al., 2008). Consequently, BFA treatment in Arabidopsis roots causes the formation of TGN/endosomal agglomerations called BFA-induced compartments. Treatment of seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with 50-µM BFA induced the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in root hairs (Figure 2, A–C). The average number of BFA-induced compartments per root hair was 3.69 ± 4.05 (sd). We also quantified the effect of BFA by obtaining the fluorescence ratio of the SPI-YPet agglomerates to the fluorescence of the root hair cytoplasm that did not contain any agglomerates (Figure 2D, inset). The higher fluorescence ratio of BFA-treated root hairs compared to untreated controls reinforces our qualitative observations of the sensitivity of SPI-YPet to BFA (Figure 2D). The appearance of fluorescent puncta at the shank of root hairs also suggests that SPI-YPet is trafficked to the tip via post-Golgi compartments (Supplemental Movies S2–S4). These results indicate that SPI-YPet is associated with endomembranes and is trafficked to the root hair tips via BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. Figure 2. Open in a new tab SPI-YPet is localized to BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. A, B, Low-magnification images showing several root hairs expressing SPI-YPet.

C, Bright field and corresponding fluorescence image of representative untreated and BFA-treated elongating root hair showing the accumulation of SPI-YPet at the apical dome in solvent control-treated seedlings (arrow).

D, Box plot of BFA-induced agglomerates of SPI-YPet in untreated control root hairs and after treatment with 50-µM BFA.

Each dot represents individual measurement from 8 to 10 root hairs per group from 9 to 12 plantsThe slow root hair growth of spi and the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates after BFA treatment suggest that spi may be defective in tip-directed protein secretion, which would partly explain the short root hair phenotypes of spi. To address this question, we expressed the secreted (SEC)-red fluorescent protein (RFP), which contains a cleavable sporamin signal peptide that accumulates in the apoplast (Faso et al., 2009), and observed changes in endocytosis using the membrane selective dye FM 1–43 in both spi and wild-type genotypes (Bolte et al., 2004; Jelínková et al., 2010; Malínská et al., 2014). Similar to previous reports, rapidly elongating wild-type root hairs had a tip-focused gradient of SEC-RFP (Sparks et al., 2016; Figure 2E). In contrast, slow-growing root hairs of spi lacked these tip-focused SEC-RFP gradients (Figure 2E). We quantified tip-focused SEC-RFP in elongating wild-type and spi root hairs by obtaining the ratio of tip fluorescence to the subapical cytoplasm (Figure 2F, inset). The lower fluorescence ratio of spi root hairs compared to the wild-type confirmed our qualitative observations (Figure 2F). These results were corroborated by examining FM 1-43 dye uptake. spi root hairs showed a significantly reduced tip-focused FM 1-43 gradient compared to the wild-type (Supplemental Figure S4, A–C). Altogether, the loss of tip-focused secretion indicated that the spi mutants had defects in tip-directed bulk flow exocytosis. SPIRRIG maintains root hair tip-focused F-actin In a study of other spi mutant alleles, the similarities in phenotypes among spi, w/sc, and arp2/3 mutants suggested that SPI could function in actin-dependent cellular processes (Saedler et al., 2009). However, because the trichome defects of spi were mild compared to other w/sc and arp2/3 mutants, no obvious actin phenotypes were observed in spi trichomes (Schwab et al., 2003). To clarify the relationship between SPI and actin, we focused on investigating actin organization in root hairs, since these structures displayed the most obvious growth defects in SPI-altered plants. To study actin organization, we expressed the live F-actin reporter UBQ10: mGFP-Lifeact in spi (Vidali et al., 2010). This particular F-actin reporter was selected because it prominently labels the tip-focused F-actin meshwork typically observed in root hairs that are rapidly growing (Sparks et al., 2016). In the wild-type, fine F-actin networks were observed in the root hair bulge, which had a weaker signal compared to the thicker actin bundles in other regions of the trichoblast (Figure 3A). As the root hair bulge expanded and the root hair transitioned to rapid tip growth, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, which consisted of short filaments and dynamic puncta, became more conspicuous (Figure 3, B–E; Supplemental Movie S5; Sparks et al., 2016)). When wild-type root hairs stopped elongating, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was replaced by thick F-actin cables (Figure 3F). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The tip-focused F-actin meshwork is disrupted in root hairs of spi. A–D, Time course of F-actin organization in a wild-type root hair from bulge formation to rapid tip growth. Weakly fluorescing F-actin networks (double asterisks) in the root hair bulge (A) reorganize into prominent tip-focused meshworks as the root hair transitions to rapid tip growth (arrows in B–D). E, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks (arrow) remain prominent in a long, rapidly elongating wild-type root hair. F, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks in wild-type root hairs are replaced with F-actin bundles (arrowheads) that protrude to the tip when growth stops. G–J, Time course of F-actin organization in a spi root hair bulge that is unable to transition to tip growth. Distinct F-actin meshworks are unable to form in root hair bulges that terminate tip growth (double asterisks, I). Thick F-actin bundles eventually form in these short, nongrowing root hair bulges (arrowhead, J). K–N, F-actin organization in slow-growing spi root hairs. Some spi root hairs show the tip-focused F-actin meshworks typically observed in the wild-type (arrow, K, L). However, tip-focused F-actin meshworks in slow-growing spi root hairs either dissipate (double asterisks, M) or prematurely form thick F-actin bundles that protrude to the tip (arrow, N). Images from (A) to (N) are based on maximum projection images of 20–25 optical sections taken at 0.5-µm intervals. O, Representative maximum projection images and corresponding computer-generated cross-sections of wild-type and spi root hair tips.

Each dot represents individual measurement from four to five root hairs per group from one to two plants. All scale bars = 10 µmF-actin organization in the tips of spi root hairs was different from that of the wild-type. As noted, some root hairs of spi were only able to form small bulges due to premature termination of tip-growth (Supplemental Figure S2). In spi root hairs, the distinct F-actin meshwork observed in wild-type root hairs was unable to form. Instead, F-actin in these spi root hair bulges contained thick F-actin cables that resembled those of wild-type root hairs that had terminated growth (Figure 3, G and H). However, the thick F-actin cables in nongrowing spi root hair bulges were unstable, as they dissipated (Figure 3I) and reformed again at a later time (Figure 3J). In the small population of spi root hairs that were able to undergo tip growth, a few exhibited a tip-focused F-actin meshwork that resembled those observed in elongating wild-type root hairs (Figure 3K). However, most of these slow-growing spi root hairs lacked a tip-focused F-actin meshwork (Figure 3, L and M; Supplemental Movie S5) or had thick F-actin bundles protruding to the tip, a feature that was reminiscent of nongrowing, mature wild-type root hairs (Figure 3N). We quantified the disruption of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi by measuring F-actin fluorescence from computer-reconstructed transverse sections of the root hair tip and by taking the ratio of the average fluorescence over background signal. A higher ratio indicates a higher signal of tip-focused F-actin (Figure 3O). Our analysis showed that the fluorescence ratio in spi root hairs was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type root hairs, supporting visual observations that the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi root hairs is disrupted (Figure 3P). To ensure that the mGFP-Lifectact probe did not interfere with normal root hair elongation or F-actin organization, we compared the growth rates of the wild-type and spi with and without the reporter. The root hair growth rates of wild-type root hairs without the mGFP-Lifeact probe were not significantly different from that of wild-type root hairs expressing the reporter. Similarly, the growth rate of spi expressing mGFP-Lifectact was not significantly different from that of spi without the reporter (Figure 3Q). We generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact to examine the correlation between SPI and F-actin in growing root hairs. In elongating root hairs of dual labeled seedlings, SPI-YPet and the mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork overlapped at the tips of actively elongating root hairs (Figure 4A;Supplemental Movie S6). In one time-lapse sequence, when the root hair stopped growing at the 80–120 min time points, both SPI-YPet and mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork dissipated from the root tip (Figure 4A). Quantification of both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact from at least three root hair time-lapse sequences revealed that the appearances of both markers at the tip were highly correlated to each other (Figure 4, B and C). This supports the notion that root hair tip-localized SPI is strongly associated with the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, and as such is involved in sustaining normal root hair elongation in coordination with actin. Figure 4. Open in a new tab SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact co-localizes at the root tip in elongating root hairs. A, Time course of a root hair simultaneously expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact.

Images are single median optical sections. Bars = 10 µm. B, Method for obtaining SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact ratios at the root hair tip for data shown in (C). A rectangular ROI at the tip and sub apex was used to measure fluorescence. C, Scatter plot showing correlation analysis of root hair tip mRuby-Lifeact fluorescence and SPI-YPet fluorescence within the same root hair. The mean fluorescence in the rectangle in region 1 divided by the rectangle in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio for each reporter. For each ratio value, root hair growth rate was obtained by measuring the displacement of the root hair tip after a 10 min interval. Line shows linear regression fit with R2 value = 0.725 and P = 2.127 × 10−8 (n = 26 time points from three root hair sequences) BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the root hair initiation domain The identification of SPI as one of the genes in the DIS group that also included genes encoding subunits of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes (Saedler et al., 2009) raises the possibility that SPI might function in root hair developmental pathways mediated by W/SC-ARP2/3. Furthermore, the observation that SPI-YPET accumulation at the root hair tip (Figure 1) mirrors the enrichment of BRK1-YFP and ARPC4-GFP at the apex of Physcomitrium protonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008) raises the possibility that the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes are localized to the root hair. In an attempt to link SPI with the W/SC and ARP2/3 pathways, we imaged roots of brk1 complemented with BRK1promoter:BRK1-YFP (hereafter referred to as BRK1-YFP; Figure 5, A–C; Dyachok et al., 2008). Unlike SPI-YPet, we did not observe a BRK1-YFP fluorescence gradient in rapidly elongating root hairs. However, closer examination of trichoblasts revealed prominent BRK1-YFP signal at the plasma membrane of the RHID that mirrored the localization of other known early root hair initiation site markers such as ROP (Figure 5A). Unlike ROP, which has a persistent plasma membrane localization throughout root hair development (Molendijk et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2002), BRK1-YFP signal was transient and dissipated as root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth (Figure 5B;Supplemental Movie S7). This observation was in contrast to the intensification of SPI-YPet fluorescence as root hairs proceeded with rapid tip growth (see Figure 1). In agreement with our visual observations, a linear regression analysis showed that BRK1-YFP fluorescence is inversely proportional to the root hair growth rate (Figure 5C). Figure 5.

Statistical significance was determined using nonparametric, two sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov pairwise test.

To address this question, we imaged a recombineered SCAR2-mCherry fusion expressed in the scar1 scar2 scar3 scar4 (scar1234) quadruple mutant background. Like BRK1-YFP, SCAR2-mCherry marked the RHID and dissipated when rapid root hair tip growth commenced (Figure 5D). The accumulation of BRK1-YFP and SCAR2-mCherry at the RHID led us to hypothesize that brk1 and scar1234 might have defects in root hair initiation. One parameter that has been studied extensively as an indicator of root hair initiation defects is planar polarity, which is a measure of root hair position along the length of the trichoblast (Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). We found that the root hair positions of brk1 and scar1234 shifted apically (i.e. toward the shoot) compared to the wild-type (Figure 5F). The planar polarity defects of brk1 were rescued by expressing BRK1-YFP in brk1, while partial complementation of scar1234 was achieved by expressing SCAR2-mCherry in scar1234 (Figure 5F). We also investigated if the ARP2/3 pathway was involved in RHID, since the W/SC complex can interact with the ARP2/3 pathway. APR2/3 subunit mutants arp2, arp3, and arpc5 exhibited significantly apically shifted root hairs that were similar to those of brk1 and scar1234 (Figure 5F). Nonetheless, we did not observe polarized accumulation of ARPC5-GFP at the RHID or at root hair tips (Supplemental Figure S5). These results suggest that the ARP2/3 pathway may interact with the W/SC complex at the RHID but is not essential for root hair positioning. Taken together, our results reveal that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID that are required for specifying the position of root hair emergence and can do so in both an ARP2/3-dependent and -independent manner. SPI is required for the depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed contrasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former intensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated (Figures 1 and 5). To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3. Similar to BRK1-YFP, BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the RHID and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded (Figure 6A). Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1-mRuby3 dissipated (Figure 6A;Supplemental Movie S8). To better understand the relationship between SPI and BRK1, we expressed BRK1-YFP in spi and SPI-YPet in brk1. Unlike BRK1-YFP in the complemented brk1 background (Figure 5B), BRK1-YFP signal in spi persisted throughout the entire imaging time course (Figure 6B). In several cases, BRK1-YFP remained visible in nongrowing root hair bulges of spi for more than 60 min. The persistence of BRK1-YFP signal was also observed in short root hair outgrowths of spi (Figure 6C;Supplemental Movie S9). To support our visual observations with quantitative data, we selected root hairs of spi and brk1 expressing BRK1-YFP that were of approximately equal lengths. From these root hairs, the ratio of BRK1-YFP tip fluorescence to subapical fluorescence was obtained (Figure 6D). These analyses showed that BRK1-YFP signal persisted in spi, as demonstrated by the higher fluorescence ratio (Figure 6E). In contrast, BRK1-YFP in brk1 root hairs disappeared from RHID when root hairs experienced rapid tip growth and thus did not exhibit a fluorescence gradient at the root tips (Figure 6, D and E). In addition, SPI-YPet in brk1 exhibited similar dynamics to SPI-YPet in the complemented spi (Figure 6F). In brk1, SPI-YPet signal was weak during early root hair bulge formation and intensified as root hair tip growth accelerated (Figure 6F). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that SPI contributes to the stability of BRK1 during the transition from root hair initiation to rapid tip growth. On the other hand, BRK1 does not appear to have direct effects on SPI during root hair initiation or rapid tip growth. Figure 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion Our work uncovers important insights into the mechanism underlying actin-mediated root hair development. A major result from our studies is the revelation that SPI is a root hair tip-localized protein. Although SPI fused to fluorescent proteins was reported to localize to endosomes and P-bodies, such studies have been limited to transient expression assays in biolistically bombarded leaves (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). As such, a mechanistic link between reported SPI subcellular localization patterns and cell growth phenotypes (i.e. short root hairs and distorted trichome shapes) described in the original spi mutant alleles has been unclear. The large size of SPI and the possibility that it is targeted to discrete cellular domains could have hindered transgenic complementation and subsequent in planta localization efforts. Through our work, we demonstrated that a SPI-YPet fusion generated through recombineering complemented spi (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). In doing so, we provide compelling evidence that SPI is a root hair tip-enriched BEACH domain-containing protein. Our studies indicate that SPI mediates root hair tip growth by maintaining the tip-focused fine F-actin meshwork, although the precise mechanism by which this is accomplished is unknown. The root hair tip-focused F-actin meshwork is the functional equivalent of domain-specific actin structures found in other tip-growing cells, such as cortical actin fringes in pollen tubes and actin spots in moss protonemata (Bascom et al., 2018a). Although the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was able to form in a population of spi root hairs, it often dissipated or was replaced by thick actin cables, a feature of mature wild-type root hairs that are terminating tip growth. Although the presence of tip-focused SPI-YPet was strongly correlated with the maintenance of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, direct causal links between SPI and F-actin have yet to be established. An alternative explanation is that tip growth-induced reduction due to the absence of SPI could lead to downstream, indirect effects on actin organization. The root hair phenotypes and corresponding depletion of tip-focused F-actin in spi is reminiscent of studies of BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammalian cells, particularly in neurons, which have often been compared to tip-growing plant cells (Baluška, 2010). For instance, neuronal dendritic spines are cytoplasmic protrusions that modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian nervous system. Actin is a major component of dendritic spines that plays a central role in driving the dynamic shape changes and secretory activities of these cytoplasmic protrusions during synaptic signaling (Cingolani and Goda, 2008). In animals, neurobeachin (Nbea) is a BEACH domain-containing protein that has a similar domain architecture to SPI. Cultured neurons of Nbea mice knockouts had fewer dendritic spine protrusions and depleted F-actin at the synapse than the wild-type (Niesmann et al., 2011). Another BEACH domain-containing protein called FAN was shown to be crucial for the formation of filopodia, i.e. actin-rich plasma membrane extensions that enable motile cells to probe their environment (Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008). FAN-deficient fibroblasts had reduced filopodia formation and were unable to reorganize their actin cytoskeletons in response to upstream activation by tumor necrosis factors (Haubert et al., 2007). Taken together, these results indicate that actin-mediated regulation of cell polarity by BEACH domain-containing proteins is likely to be conserved across animals and plants. The formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in response to BFA indicates that SPI is associated with post-Golgi compartments. This result is consistent with observations made with BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammals. For example, Nbea was shown to localize to vesicular endomembranes adjacent to the TGN, and like SPI, the distribution of Nbea-positive post-Golgi compartments was altered by BFA (Wang et al., 2000). Furthermore, the Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) Nbea homolog SEL-2 was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding that sel-2 mutants mistarget proteins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolateral surface (de Souza et al., 2007). Here, the protein secretory marker SEC-RFP, which is typically trafficked to the tips of elongating wild-type root hairs (Sparks et al., 2016), was uniformly distributed in spi root hairs. The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients in spi root hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. Another significant result from our studies is the discovery that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID. The localization of BRK1 and SCAR2 to the RHID and their dissipation as root hair tip growth commenced contrasts with findings in Physcomitrium in which a functional BRK1-YFP distinctly labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Like BRK1-YFP, an ARPC4-GFP construct labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008), whereas no clear tip-focused labeling of ARPC5-GFP was observed in root hairs (Supplemental Figure S5). The observation that BRK1-YFP prominently localized to the RHID but dissipated during active root hair tip growth was surprising given that Arabidopsis BRK1 complemented the defective filamentous growth of Physcomitrium BRK1 knockouts (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Physcomitrium BRK1 and ARPC4 mutants have clear tip growth defects, while Arabidopsis mutants in the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have only weak to no tip growth abnormalities (Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008). This suggests that seed plants might have evolved a specialized function for the W/SC complex at the site of root hair emergence and early bulge formation with only a minor role in driving actin-dependent tip growth. Moreover, a recent discovery regarding the emergence of an ARP2/3 independent W/SC pathway in the regulation of F-actin dynamics for sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis pollen tubes further indicates that this occurrence may be more common in seed plants. On the other hand, the knockouts of an Arabidopsis SPI ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha led to short rhizoids, indicating that SPI has conserved functions across land plants in regulating tip growth (Honkanen et al., 2016). In other single cell types such as diffusely growing trichomes, W/SC and ARP2/3 subunits likely play a more prominent role than SPI based on their more severe trichome phenotypes when the expression of their encoding genes is suppressed. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal in spi root hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, it is tempting to speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways. This possibility is supported by studies in mammals pointing to a role for BEACH domain-containing proteins in protein degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. In mouse models, for example, the BEACH domain-containing protein WDR81 was shown to be essential for the removal of autophagy-dependent ubiquitinated proteins (Liu et al., 2017). In this regard, it is worth noting that the W/SC-ARP2/3 pathway was demonstrated to function in stress-induced autophagy (Wang et al., 2016) and that proteasome inhibitors stabilized SCAR during dark-induced primary root growth inhibition (Dyachok et al., 2011). It is possible that SPI-mediated proteolytic pathways and BRK1 coordinate their activities to specify the levels of W/SC at the RHID that enable the transition to actin-dependent rapid tip growth. However, such a scenario is complicated by the observation that the formation of tip-directed SPI-YPet does not appear to require BRK1. This suggests that SPI’s appearance at the root hair tip is likely regulated by other factors besides the W/SC complex. Alternatively, the failure of BRK1 to disappear from the RHID in spi mutants may be caused by a general failure to transition to normal tip growth. Future studies will require subjecting root hairs to conditions that prematurely terminate tip growth to determine if BRK1 signals persist. In summary, our work provides data that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development. A crucial result from our work is the discovery that SPI and the W/SC subunits BRK1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization patterns in root hairs that point to potential functional relationships among these proteins during root hair development. In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and W/SC and ask whether SPI physically interacts with actin or subunits of W/SC to better explain the functional links between SPI and W/SC.",

SPIRRIG and SCAR/WAVE are molecular determinants of actin-mediated root hair development in Arabidopsis.Abstract Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.Introduction Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth, a process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves a balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi compartments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a). Open in a new tabRoot epidermal cells called trichoblasts are the cell types that form root hairs. Work in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that trichoblasts are specified to become root hair-forming cells early during root development through the patterned assembly of protein complexes of transcriptional activators and repressors in different cell files (Schiefelbein et al., 2014; Shibata et al., 2018). Upon establishing their identity, trichoblasts undergo two developmental stages that lead to root hair outgrowth. The first stage is the establishment of a root hair initiation domain (RHID) that eventually leads to a conspicuous root hair bulge at the basal (root-tip oriented) end of the trichoblast (Grierson et al., 2014; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). Several proteins accumulate at the RHID, most prominently, the Rho of Plants (ROP) small GTPases and their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activators (Denninger et al., 2019). The second stage is tip growth. In addition to small GTPases, the cytoskeleton, the endomembrane trafficking machinery, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide lipids, hormones (e.g. auxin and ethylene), and reactive oxygen species are other major players in signaling pathways that modulate root hair development (Bascom et al., 2018a; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). The filamentous-actin (F-actin) and microtubule cytoskeletons orchestrate root hair development. The actin cytoskeleton in particular has been studied widely during tip growth, as it functions as tracks for the trafficking of cellular cargo to the cell apex (Stephan, 2017; Bascom et al., 2018a; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). Many insights into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in tip growth have been demonstrated through work with Arabidopsis mutants and pharmacological approaches involving the use of chemicals that disrupt F-actin. For example, the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B (LatB) inhibits tip growth, while also inducing the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes with irregular shapes (Bibikova et al., 1999; Gibbon et al., 1999). In this regard, Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the root hair-expressed vegetative ACTIN2 (ACT2) gene are characterized by root hairs that mirror those treated with LatB (Ringli et al., 2002; Yoo et al., 2012). Furthermore, ACT2 and ACT7 mutants display an apical (shoot-ward) shift in the position of the RHID compared to the wild-type (Kiefer et al., 2015). To fulfill its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton is organized into higher order networks that correspond to the growth strategy of the cell. This is evident in tip-growing cells, whereby the base and shank of the cell consist mostly of thick, longitudinal F-actin bundles, while the apex contains actin fringes, rings, patches, or a fine meshwork, depending on the plant species or cell type (Stephan, 2017). To sustain tip growth, the integrity and organization of these tip-focused F-actin arrays must be maintained, a task facilitated by a diverse collection of actin-binding proteins and actin nucleators (Li et al., 2015; Paez-Garcia, 2018; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). The actin-related protein (ARP2/3) complex and its activator, suppressor of cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex (W/SC), is one of the most well-characterized actin nucleators in plants (Deeks and Hussey, 2005; Szymanski, 2005; Yanagisawa et al., 2013). Upon conversion from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation, the ARP2/3 complex promotes F-actin nucleation from the sides of existing filaments by forming a surface that mimics stable actin dimers (Blanchoin et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2001; Rodal et al., 2005). Activation of ARP2/3 for efficient nucleation of F-actin requires the W/SC nucleation promoting factor (NPF) complex. In addition to W/SC, the NPF consists of the proteins SRA1, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC300/BRICK1 (BRK1) (Basu et al., 2004, 2005; El-Assal et al., 2004; Djakovic et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005b, 2008; Jörgens et al., 2010). Studies of Arabidopsis trichome development have been most instrumental in revealing insights into the function of W/SC-ARP2/3 in plants. Plant counterparts to the mammalian W/SC-ARP2/3 subunits were first uncovered through the cloning of disrupted genes in a set of DISTORTED (DIS) Arabidopsis trichome mutants (Hülskamp et al., 1994; Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2004; Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005a). W/SC is the only known NPF for ARP2/3, and BRK1 and SCAR mutants display null arp2/3 trichome phenotypes (Le et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). In addition to trichome development, the W/SC-ARP2/3 actin filament-nucleating module has been implicated in specifying leaf pavement cell shape, light and auxin-dependent root growth, stomatal gating, gravitropism, responses to salinity stress, and plant immunity (Li et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005a; Dyachok et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2016; Isner et al., 2017; Pratap Sahi et al., 2018; Badet et al., 2019). The W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have been shown to play essential roles in some tip growing cells, such as the protonemal cells of the moss Physcomitrium (formerly Physcomitrella) patens. This was shown when RNA interference of transcripts encoding selected subunits of the moss W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes resulted in substantial protonemal tip growth defects (Harries et al., 2005; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006; Finka et al., 2008). The importance of the W/SC andARP2/3 complexes was further demonstrated by Perroud and Quatrano (2006, 2008), who showed that two of its components, BRK1 and ARPC4, accumulated in tips of moss protonemal cells. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants with mutations in components of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes displayed minimal or no defects in root hair or pollen tube growth (Li et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003), and none of the subunits have been conclusively shown to exhibit clear polar localization in these cell types. Therefore, the extent by which the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes function in tip growing cells of plants remains to be determined. SPIRRIG (SPI) is one of eight genes that has been considered to be a member of the DIS group, but compared to other DIS mutants, the trichome phenotypes of spi are less severe and the mutant does not display early stage cell swelling that is diagnostic of the DIS group (Schwab et al., 2003). SPI was shown to encode a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo and concanavalin A-like lectin domains and C-terminally located pleckstrin homology, beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH), and WD40 repeat domains (Saedler et al., 2009). BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis, and receptor signaling. This family of proteins is of clinical importance as they have been implicated in a variety of human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmunity syndrome, and autism (Cullinane et al., 2013). In addition to mild trichome defects, Arabidopsis SPI mutants have short root hairs characterized by fragmented vacuoles, suggesting that SPI, like other eukaryotic BEACH domain-containing proteins, functions in membrane trafficking (Saedler et al., 2009). Additionally, Steffens et al. (2017) showed that SPI physically interacts with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, reinforcing its role in membrane remodeling. SPI was also demonstrated to localize to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis epidermal cells, thereby suggesting a novel role for SPI in post-transcriptional regulation (Steffens et al., 2015). Because SPI had a substantial but incomplete overlap with distorted mutant phenotypes, it was suggested that SPI might be involved in actin-mediated cell developmental processes (Saedler et al., 2009), and perhaps function in coordination with W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes. However, SPI is not a known W/SC or ARP2/3 subunit; therefore, its relationship to ARP2/3 function is unclear. Moreover, the uncertainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype when SPI is mutated, remains unknown. In the current study, we addressed these questions by generating a fully functional SPI fluorescent protein fusion and documented its spatial and temporal localization during root hair development. In addition, we used live cell microscopy to simultaneously image the dynamics of SPI and W/SC and correlate SPI localization with root hair tip-focused F-actin. Taken together, our results point to potential functional relationships among SPI, W/SC, and actin during root hair development.Results Isolation of a new SPIRRIG mutant allele We previously described a forward genetic screen that led to the isolation of three nonallelic recessive Arabidopsis mutants that were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of LatB. The hypersensitive to LatB1 (hlb1) and hlb3 mutants have been described previously (Sparks et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). hlb1 was disrupted in a gene encoding a trans-Golgi network-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in actin-mediated membrane recycling (Sparks et al., 2016), whereas the genetic lesion in hlb3 was found to encode the class II actin nucleator formin (Sun et al., 2019). Here, we report on hlb2, the third of these recessive mutants. Like hlb1 and hlb3, primary root growth was more severely inhibited by LatB in hlb2 compared to the wild-type. In the absence of LatB or at low (i.e. 25 nM) LatB concentrations, the primary root length of hlb2 was similar to the wild-type. Differences in root length between wild-type and hlb2 became apparent when seedlings were grown on a concentration of 50-nM LatB and higher (Supplemental Figure S1, A–C). Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 was confined to a region between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that hlb2 had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position: 720,152–720,161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. This 10-base pair deletion led to an open-reading frame shift at the Asp1526 codon, resulting in a truncated protein (Supplemental Figure S2A). AT1G03060 encodes the BEACH domain-containing protein SPI (Saedler et al., 2009; Supplemental Figure S2A). Because the first spi mutant alleles were reported to have short root hairs (Saedler et al., 2009), we examined root hairs of hlb2. The growth rate of hlb2 root hairs was approximately 70% slower than the wild-type, with some root hairs forming only small bulges (Supplemental Figure S2, B and C). Moreover, hlb2 had mild trichome defects that were reminiscent of the phenotypes of previously isolated spi mutant alleles (Supplemental Figure S2D; Saedler et al., 2009). To further verify if HLB2 is SPI, we obtained a mutant from the publicly available SALK collection (SALK_065311), which had a T-DNA insertion in the 10th exon of the SPI gene (Supplemental Figure S2A; Alonso et al., 2003). The SALK_065311 line we obtained is the same as the spi-3 mutant allele reported previously in Steffens et al. (2015). In addition to having similar root hair and trichome defects to hlb2, primary roots of spi-3 were hypersensitive to LatB (Supplemental Figure S2E), and a cross between hlb2 and SALK_065311 failed to complement each other in the F1 hybrid. Taken together, these results indicate that hlb2 is a new spi mutant allele. Based on earlier nomenclature (Steffens et al., 2015), we renamed hlb2 as spi-5 (Supplemental Figure S2A). The spi-5 mutant allele was used for all subsequent experiments.SPIRRIG localizes to the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs SPI fluorescent protein fusions were previously demonstrated to associate with P-bodies and endosomes (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). However, these constructs have not been shown to complement the defective root hair and trichome phenotypes of spi. Due to the large size of SPI, we were unable to generate native promoter-driven fluorescent protein fusions to the full-length SPI complementary DNA or genomic DNA. To overcome this problem, SPI was tagged with the 3x-Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) for energy transfer (YPet; Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) using a method called recombineering. This method involves tagging the gene of interest in the context of transformation-competent bacterial artificial chromosomes to ensure that all regulatory sequences are included in the fluorescent protein fusion (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). Once spi was transformed with a recombineered SPI-YPet construct, primary root hypersensitivity to LatB, short root hairs, and defective trichome phenotypes were rescued, indicating that the construct was functional (Figure 1A;Supplemental Figure S3). Transgenic complementation of spi with SPI-YPet provided additional evidence that HLB2 is SPI. Confocal microscopy of more than 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings revealed that SPI-YPet signal was strongest in the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs (Figure 1, B and C; (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). Low magnification time-lapse movies showed that 100% of rapidly elongating root hairs had robust SPI-YPet signal at the tips (Supplemental Movie S1). Weak or no SPI-YPet fluorescence was detected at the RHID and during early root hair bulge formation, but the signal intensified as the root hairs transitioned to tip growth (Figure 1C;Supplemental Movie S3). SPI-YPet signal dissipated as the root hairs matured and the tip growth rate declined (Figure 1, B and C; Supplemental Movie S4). A linear regression analysis showed that the intensity of SPI-YPet fluorescence in root hair tips is significantly positively correlated to rapid root hair growth (Figure 1D). These results indicate that the SPI protein has functions related to root hair elongation, which is consistent with the short root hair phenotypes of spi. Figure 1.

Line shows linear regression fit with R2 value = 0.308 and P = 1.72 × 10−5 (n=5–7 root hairs per time point)SPIRRIG is transported to the root hair tip via post-Golgi compartments The prominent SPI-YPet signal at the tips of elongating root hairs is reminiscent of the localization patterns of post-Golgi markers such as RAB small GTPases, which are known to function in tip-directed secretion (Preuss et al., 2004). We therefore hypothesized that SPI is trafficked to the tips of root hairs via post-Golgi compartments. To test this hypothesis, we treated seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with Brefeldin A (BFA). BFA is a fungal toxin that is routinely used to investigate endomembrane dynamics because it prevents vesicle formation for exocytosis by inhibiting ADP ribosylation factor GEFs (ARF-GEFs), while still enabling endocytosis and some retrograde pathways to continue (Baluška, 2002, Doyle et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis roots, BFA binds to the ARF-GEF GNOM, which is localized to early endosomes in the endocytic pathway, and possibly also in the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Robinson et al., 2008). Consequently, BFA treatment in Arabidopsis roots causes the formation of TGN/endosomal agglomerations called BFA-induced compartments. Treatment of seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with 50-µM BFA induced the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in root hairs (Figure 2, A–C). The average number of BFA-induced compartments per root hair was 3.69 ± 4.05 (sd). We also quantified the effect of BFA by obtaining the fluorescence ratio of the SPI-YPet agglomerates to the fluorescence of the root hair cytoplasm that did not contain any agglomerates (Figure 2D, inset). The higher fluorescence ratio of BFA-treated root hairs compared to untreated controls reinforces our qualitative observations of the sensitivity of SPI-YPet to BFA (Figure 2D). The appearance of fluorescent puncta at the shank of root hairs also suggests that SPI-YPet is trafficked to the tip via post-Golgi compartments (Supplemental Movies S2–S4). These results indicate that SPI-YPet is associated with endomembranes and is trafficked to the root hair tips via BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. Figure 2. Open in a new tab SPI-YPet is localized to BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. A, B, Low-magnification images showing several root hairs expressing SPI-YPet.

C, Bright field and corresponding fluorescence image of representative untreated and BFA-treated elongating root hair showing the accumulation of SPI-YPet at the apical dome in solvent control-treated seedlings (arrow).

D, Box plot of BFA-induced agglomerates of SPI-YPet in untreated control root hairs and after treatment with 50-µM BFA.

F, Box plot of SEC-RFP root hair tip accumulation expressed as fluorescence ratio. Ratio values were obtained by dividing mean fluorescence in oval region in 1 over region 2 (inset).

Each dot represents individual measurement from 8 to 10 root hairs per group from 9 to 12 plantsThe slow root hair growth of spi and the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates after BFA treatment suggest that spi may be defective in tip-directed protein secretion, which would partly explain the short root hair phenotypes of spi. To address this question, we expressed the secreted (SEC)-red fluorescent protein (RFP), which contains a cleavable sporamin signal peptide that accumulates in the apoplast (Faso et al., 2009), and observed changes in endocytosis using the membrane selective dye FM 1–43 in both spi and wild-type genotypes (Bolte et al., 2004; Jelínková et al., 2010; Malínská et al., 2014). Similar to previous reports, rapidly elongating wild-type root hairs had a tip-focused gradient of SEC-RFP (Sparks et al., 2016; Figure 2E). In contrast, slow-growing root hairs of spi lacked these tip-focused SEC-RFP gradients (Figure 2E). We quantified tip-focused SEC-RFP in elongating wild-type and spi root hairs by obtaining the ratio of tip fluorescence to the subapical cytoplasm (Figure 2F, inset). The lower fluorescence ratio of spi root hairs compared to the wild-type confirmed our qualitative observations (Figure 2F). These results were corroborated by examining FM 1-43 dye uptake. spi root hairs showed a significantly reduced tip-focused FM 1-43 gradient compared to the wild-type (Supplemental Figure S4, A–C). Altogether, the loss of tip-focused secretion indicated that the spi mutants had defects in tip-directed bulk flow exocytosis.SPIRRIG maintains root hair tip-focused F-actin In a study of other spi mutant alleles, the similarities in phenotypes among spi, w/sc, and arp2/3 mutants suggested that SPI could function in actin-dependent cellular processes (Saedler et al., 2009). However, because the trichome defects of spi were mild compared to other w/sc and arp2/3 mutants, no obvious actin phenotypes were observed in spi trichomes (Schwab et al., 2003). To clarify the relationship between SPI and actin, we focused on investigating actin organization in root hairs, since these structures displayed the most obvious growth defects in SPI-altered plants. To study actin organization, we expressed the live F-actin reporter UBQ10: mGFP-Lifeact in spi (Vidali et al., 2010). This particular F-actin reporter was selected because it prominently labels the tip-focused F-actin meshwork typically observed in root hairs that are rapidly growing (Sparks et al., 2016). In the wild-type, fine F-actin networks were observed in the root hair bulge, which had a weaker signal compared to the thicker actin bundles in other regions of the trichoblast (Figure 3A). As the root hair bulge expanded and the root hair transitioned to rapid tip growth, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, which consisted of short filaments and dynamic puncta, became more conspicuous (Figure 3, B–E; Supplemental Movie S5; Sparks et al., 2016)). When wild-type root hairs stopped elongating, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was replaced by thick F-actin cables (Figure 3F). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The tip-focused F-actin meshwork is disrupted in root hairs of spi. A–D, Time course of F-actin organization in a wild-type root hair from bulge formation to rapid tip growth. Weakly fluorescing F-actin networks (double asterisks) in the root hair bulge (A) reorganize into prominent tip-focused meshworks as the root hair transitions to rapid tip growth (arrows in B–D). E, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks (arrow) remain prominent in a long, rapidly elongating wild-type root hair. F, Tip-focused F-actin meshworks in wild-type root hairs are replaced with F-actin bundles (arrowheads) that protrude to the tip when growth stops. G–J, Time course of F-actin organization in a spi root hair bulge that is unable to transition to tip growth. Distinct F-actin meshworks are unable to form in root hair bulges that terminate tip growth (double asterisks, I). Thick F-actin bundles eventually form in these short, nongrowing root hair bulges (arrowhead, J). K–N, F-actin organization in slow-growing spi root hairs. Some spi root hairs show the tip-focused F-actin meshworks typically observed in the wild-type (arrow, K, L). However, tip-focused F-actin meshworks in slow-growing spi root hairs either dissipate (double asterisks, M) or prematurely form thick F-actin bundles that protrude to the tip (arrow, N). Images from (A) to (N) are based on maximum projection images of 20–25 optical sections taken at 0.5-µm intervals. O, Representative maximum projection images and corresponding computer-generated cross-sections of wild-type and spi root hair tips. Only growing root hairs with a clear cytoplasmic cap were selected for analysis.

Each dot represents individual measurement from four to five root hairs per group from one to two plants. All scale bars = 10 µmF-actin organization in the tips of spi root hairs was different from that of the wild-type. As noted, some root hairs of spi were only able to form small bulges due to premature termination of tip-growth (Supplemental Figure S2). In spi root hairs, the distinct F-actin meshwork observed in wild-type root hairs was unable to form. Instead, F-actin in these spi root hair bulges contained thick F-actin cables that resembled those of wild-type root hairs that had terminated growth (Figure 3, G and H). However, the thick F-actin cables in nongrowing spi root hair bulges were unstable, as they dissipated (Figure 3I) and reformed again at a later time (Figure 3J). In the small population of spi root hairs that were able to undergo tip growth, a few exhibited a tip-focused F-actin meshwork that resembled those observed in elongating wild-type root hairs (Figure 3K). However, most of these slow-growing spi root hairs lacked a tip-focused F-actin meshwork (Figure 3, L and M; Supplemental Movie S5) or had thick F-actin bundles protruding to the tip, a feature that was reminiscent of nongrowing, mature wild-type root hairs (Figure 3N). We quantified the disruption of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi by measuring F-actin fluorescence from computer-reconstructed transverse sections of the root hair tip and by taking the ratio of the average fluorescence over background signal. A higher ratio indicates a higher signal of tip-focused F-actin (Figure 3O). Our analysis showed that the fluorescence ratio in spi root hairs was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type root hairs, supporting visual observations that the tip-focused F-actin meshwork in spi root hairs is disrupted (Figure 3P). To ensure that the mGFP-Lifectact probe did not interfere with normal root hair elongation or F-actin organization, we compared the growth rates of the wild-type and spi with and without the reporter. The root hair growth rates of wild-type root hairs without the mGFP-Lifeact probe were not significantly different from that of wild-type root hairs expressing the reporter. Similarly, the growth rate of spi expressing mGFP-Lifectact was not significantly different from that of spi without the reporter (Figure 3Q). We generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact to examine the correlation between SPI and F-actin in growing root hairs. In elongating root hairs of dual labeled seedlings, SPI-YPet and the mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork overlapped at the tips of actively elongating root hairs (Figure 4A;Supplemental Movie S6). In one time-lapse sequence, when the root hair stopped growing at the 80–120 min time points, both SPI-YPet and mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork dissipated from the root tip (Figure 4A). Quantification of both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact from at least three root hair time-lapse sequences revealed that the appearances of both markers at the tip were highly correlated to each other (Figure 4, B and C). This supports the notion that root hair tip-localized SPI is strongly associated with the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, and as such is involved in sustaining normal root hair elongation in coordination with actin.

The mean fluorescence in the rectangle in region 1 divided by the rectangle in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio for each reporter. For each ratio value, root hair growth rate was obtained by measuring the displacement of the root hair tip after a 10 min interval. Line shows linear regression fit with R2 value = 0.725 and P = 2.127 × 10−8 (n = 26 time points from three root hair sequences)BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the root hair initiation domain The identification of SPI as one of the genes in the DIS group that also included genes encoding subunits of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes (Saedler et al., 2009) raises the possibility that SPI might function in root hair developmental pathways mediated by W/SC-ARP2/3. Furthermore, the observation that SPI-YPET accumulation at the root hair tip (Figure 1) mirrors the enrichment of BRK1-YFP and ARPC4-GFP at the apex of Physcomitrium protonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008) raises the possibility that the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes are localized to the root hair. In an attempt to link SPI with the W/SC and ARP2/3 pathways, we imaged roots of brk1 complemented with BRK1promoter:BRK1-YFP (hereafter referred to as BRK1-YFP; Figure 5, A–C; Dyachok et al., 2008). Unlike SPI-YPet, we did not observe a BRK1-YFP fluorescence gradient in rapidly elongating root hairs. However, closer examination of trichoblasts revealed prominent BRK1-YFP signal at the plasma membrane of the RHID that mirrored the localization of other known early root hair initiation site markers such as ROP (Figure 5A). Unlike ROP, which has a persistent plasma membrane localization throughout root hair development (Molendijk et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2002), BRK1-YFP signal was transient and dissipated as root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth (Figure 5B;Supplemental Movie S7). This observation was in contrast to the intensification of SPI-YPet fluorescence as root hairs proceeded with rapid tip growth (see Figure 1). In agreement with our visual observations, a linear regression analysis showed that BRK1-YFP fluorescence is inversely proportional to the root hair growth rate (Figure 5C). Figure 5.

E, Brightfield microscopy images of representative trichoblasts from 6-d-old seedlings showing apical shift in root hair position of brk1 compared to the wild-type, and complementation of brk1 planar polarity phenotypes by BRK1-YFP.

To address this question, we imaged a recombineered SCAR2-mCherry fusion expressed in the scar1 scar2 scar3 scar4 (scar1234) quadruple mutant background. Like BRK1-YFP, SCAR2-mCherry marked the RHID and dissipated when rapid root hair tip growth commenced (Figure 5D). The accumulation of BRK1-YFP and SCAR2-mCherry at the RHID led us to hypothesize that brk1 and scar1234 might have defects in root hair initiation. One parameter that has been studied extensively as an indicator of root hair initiation defects is planar polarity, which is a measure of root hair position along the length of the trichoblast (Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). We found that the root hair positions of brk1 and scar1234 shifted apically (i.e. toward the shoot) compared to the wild-type (Figure 5F). The planar polarity defects of brk1 were rescued by expressing BRK1-YFP in brk1, while partial complementation of scar1234 was achieved by expressing SCAR2-mCherry in scar1234 (Figure 5F). We also investigated if the ARP2/3 pathway was involved in RHID, since the W/SC complex can interact with the ARP2/3 pathway. APR2/3 subunit mutants arp2, arp3, and arpc5 exhibited significantly apically shifted root hairs that were similar to those of brk1 and scar1234 (Figure 5F). Nonetheless, we did not observe polarized accumulation of ARPC5-GFP at the RHID or at root hair tips (Supplemental Figure S5). These results suggest that the ARP2/3 pathway may interact with the W/SC complex at the RHID but is not essential for root hair positioning. Taken together, our results reveal that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID that are required for specifying the position of root hair emergence and can do so in both an ARP2/3-dependent and -independent manner.SPI is required for the depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed contrasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former intensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated (Figures 1 and 5). To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3. Similar to BRK1-YFP, BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the RHID and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded (Figure 6A). Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1-mRuby3 dissipated (Figure 6A;Supplemental Movie S8). To better understand the relationship between SPI and BRK1, we expressed BRK1-YFP in spi and SPI-YPet in brk1. Unlike BRK1-YFP in the complemented brk1 background (Figure 5B), BRK1-YFP signal in spi persisted throughout the entire imaging time course (Figure 6B). In several cases, BRK1-YFP remained visible in nongrowing root hair bulges of spi for more than 60 min. The persistence of BRK1-YFP signal was also observed in short root hair outgrowths of spi (Figure 6C;Supplemental Movie S9). To support our visual observations with quantitative data, we selected root hairs of spi and brk1 expressing BRK1-YFP that were of approximately equal lengths. From these root hairs, the ratio of BRK1-YFP tip fluorescence to subapical fluorescence was obtained (Figure 6D). These analyses showed that BRK1-YFP signal persisted in spi, as demonstrated by the higher fluorescence ratio (Figure 6E). In contrast, BRK1-YFP in brk1 root hairs disappeared from RHID when root hairs experienced rapid tip growth and thus did not exhibit a fluorescence gradient at the root tips (Figure 6, D and E). In addition, SPI-YPet in brk1 exhibited similar dynamics to SPI-YPet in the complemented spi (Figure 6F). In brk1, SPI-YPet signal was weak during early root hair bulge formation and intensified as root hair tip growth accelerated (Figure 6F). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that SPI contributes to the stability of BRK1 during the transition from root hair initiation to rapid tip growth. On the other hand, BRK1 does not appear to have direct effects on SPI during root hair initiation or rapid tip growth. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth is delayed in spi.

F, Accumulation of SPI-YPet at the root hair tip is not altered in brk1. Bar = 20 µmDiscussion Our work uncovers important insights into the mechanism underlying actin-mediated root hair development. A major result from our studies is the revelation that SPI is a root hair tip-localized protein. Although SPI fused to fluorescent proteins was reported to localize to endosomes and P-bodies, such studies have been limited to transient expression assays in biolistically bombarded leaves (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). As such, a mechanistic link between reported SPI subcellular localization patterns and cell growth phenotypes (i.e. short root hairs and distorted trichome shapes) described in the original spi mutant alleles has been unclear. The large size of SPI and the possibility that it is targeted to discrete cellular domains could have hindered transgenic complementation and subsequent in planta localization efforts. Through our work, we demonstrated that a SPI-YPet fusion generated through recombineering complemented spi (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). In doing so, we provide compelling evidence that SPI is a root hair tip-enriched BEACH domain-containing protein. Our studies indicate that SPI mediates root hair tip growth by maintaining the tip-focused fine F-actin meshwork, although the precise mechanism by which this is accomplished is unknown. The root hair tip-focused F-actin meshwork is the functional equivalent of domain-specific actin structures found in other tip-growing cells, such as cortical actin fringes in pollen tubes and actin spots in moss protonemata (Bascom et al., 2018a). Although the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was able to form in a population of spi root hairs, it often dissipated or was replaced by thick actin cables, a feature of mature wild-type root hairs that are terminating tip growth. Although the presence of tip-focused SPI-YPet was strongly correlated with the maintenance of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, direct causal links between SPI and F-actin have yet to be established. An alternative explanation is that tip growth-induced reduction due to the absence of SPI could lead to downstream, indirect effects on actin organization. The root hair phenotypes and corresponding depletion of tip-focused F-actin in spi is reminiscent of studies of BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammalian cells, particularly in neurons, which have often been compared to tip-growing plant cells (Baluška, 2010). For instance, neuronal dendritic spines are cytoplasmic protrusions that modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian nervous system. Actin is a major component of dendritic spines that plays a central role in driving the dynamic shape changes and secretory activities of these cytoplasmic protrusions during synaptic signaling (Cingolani and Goda, 2008). In animals, neurobeachin (Nbea) is a BEACH domain-containing protein that has a similar domain architecture to SPI. Cultured neurons of Nbea mice knockouts had fewer dendritic spine protrusions and depleted F-actin at the synapse than the wild-type (Niesmann et al., 2011). Another BEACH domain-containing protein called FAN was shown to be crucial for the formation of filopodia, i.e. actin-rich plasma membrane extensions that enable motile cells to probe their environment (Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008). FAN-deficient fibroblasts had reduced filopodia formation and were unable to reorganize their actin cytoskeletons in response to upstream activation by tumor necrosis factors (Haubert et al., 2007). Taken together, these results indicate that actin-mediated regulation of cell polarity by BEACH domain-containing proteins is likely to be conserved across animals and plants. The formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in response to BFA indicates that SPI is associated with post-Golgi compartments. This result is consistent with observations made with BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammals. For example, Nbea was shown to localize to vesicular endomembranes adjacent to the TGN, and like SPI, the distribution of Nbea-positive post-Golgi compartments was altered by BFA (Wang et al., 2000). Furthermore, the Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) Nbea homolog SEL-2 was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding that sel-2 mutants mistarget proteins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolateral surface (de Souza et al., 2007). Here, the protein secretory marker SEC-RFP, which is typically trafficked to the tips of elongating wild-type root hairs (Sparks et al., 2016), was uniformly distributed in spi root hairs. The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients in spi root hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. Another significant result from our studies is the discovery that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID. The localization of BRK1 and SCAR2 to the RHID and their dissipation as root hair tip growth commenced contrasts with findings in Physcomitrium in which a functional BRK1-YFP distinctly labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Like BRK1-YFP, an ARPC4-GFP construct labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008), whereas no clear tip-focused labeling of ARPC5-GFP was observed in root hairs (Supplemental Figure S5). The observation that BRK1-YFP prominently localized to the RHID but dissipated during active root hair tip growth was surprising given that Arabidopsis BRK1 complemented the defective filamentous growth of Physcomitrium BRK1 knockouts (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Physcomitrium BRK1 and ARPC4 mutants have clear tip growth defects, while Arabidopsis mutants in the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have only weak to no tip growth abnormalities (Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008). This suggests that seed plants might have evolved a specialized function for the W/SC complex at the site of root hair emergence and early bulge formation with only a minor role in driving actin-dependent tip growth. Moreover, a recent discovery regarding the emergence of an ARP2/3 independent W/SC pathway in the regulation of F-actin dynamics for sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis pollen tubes further indicates that this occurrence may be more common in seed plants. On the other hand, the knockouts of an Arabidopsis SPI ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha led to short rhizoids, indicating that SPI has conserved functions across land plants in regulating tip growth (Honkanen et al., 2016). In other single cell types such as diffusely growing trichomes, W/SC and ARP2/3 subunits likely play a more prominent role than SPI based on their more severe trichome phenotypes when the expression of their encoding genes is suppressed. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal in spi root hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, it is tempting to speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways. This possibility is supported by studies in mammals pointing to a role for BEACH domain-containing proteins in protein degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. In mouse models, for example, the BEACH domain-containing protein WDR81 was shown to be essential for the removal of autophagy-dependent ubiquitinated proteins (Liu et al., 2017). In this regard, it is worth noting that the W/SC-ARP2/3 pathway was demonstrated to function in stress-induced autophagy (Wang et al., 2016) and that proteasome inhibitors stabilized SCAR during dark-induced primary root growth inhibition (Dyachok et al., 2011). It is possible that SPI-mediated proteolytic pathways and BRK1 coordinate their activities to specify the levels of W/SC at the RHID that enable the transition to actin-dependent rapid tip growth. However, such a scenario is complicated by the observation that the formation of tip-directed SPI-YPet does not appear to require BRK1. This suggests that SPI’s appearance at the root hair tip is likely regulated by other factors besides the W/SC complex. Alternatively, the failure of BRK1 to disappear from the RHID in spi mutants may be caused by a general failure to transition to normal tip growth. Future studies will require subjecting root hairs to conditions that prematurely terminate tip growth to determine if BRK1 signals persist. In summary, our work provides data that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development. A crucial result from our work is the discovery that SPI and the W/SC subunits BRK1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization patterns in root hairs that point to potential functional relationships among these proteins during root hair development. In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and W/SC and ask whether SPI physically interacts with actin or subunits of W/SC to better explain the functional links between SPI and W/SC.Materials and methods Forward-genetic screening and map-based cloning The A. thaliana hlb mutants from which the spi-5 mutant allele was identified were isolated from a population of T-DNA seeds (Arabidopsis Biological Research Center stock CS31100). Plants generated from these seeds were transformed with the activation tagging pSKI015 plasmid (Weigel et al., 2000; Sparks et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). Briefly, mutagenized seeds were surface sterilized in 95% (v/v) ethanol and 20% bleach (v/v), followed by three washes in sterile deionized water. A solution of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium with vitamins (PhytoTech Labs, USA) and 1% (w/v) sucrose was prepared, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.7. After adding 0.5% agar (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich), the solution was autoclaved and allowed to cool at room temperature. Upon reaching 55°C, a stock solution of 10-mM LatB (CalBiochem-EMD Chemicals) in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to make a final LatB concentration of 100 nM. Sterilized seeds were suspended in the MS–agar–LatB medium and gently swirled to evenly distribute the seeds. The seed–MS–agar–LatB mixture was poured to a thickness of 2 mm on the bases of 10 cm × 10 cm Petri dishes. After incubating the plates at 4°C for 48 h, they were positioned vertically in a Conviron plant growth chamber set to 24°C with a 14-h light (120 µmol m−2 s−1)/10-h dark cycle. Six days after transfer to the Conviron growth chamber, seedlings that exhibited severe growth inhibition were transplanted to LatB-free medium and grown to maturity. For LatB hypersensitivity assays, seeds from selected plants and the hlb2 mutant were planted on the surface of a 3 mm layer of polymerized 0.5× MS—1% agar growth medium in gridded square 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plates and grown in the same Conviron used for screening. Four-day-old seedlings with primary roots that were ∼1 cm long were selected. Selected seedlings were transplanted to a new set of square Petri dishes containing MS medium supplemented with 50-nM LatB or MS supplemented with the appropriate volume of LatB solvent (i.e. DMSO). During transplantation, the tip of the root was positioned at the grid line of the Petri dish and maintained in a vertical orientation. Four days after transplanting, images of the roots were captured with a Nikon Insight digital camera mounted on a copy stand. Primary root length was expressed as the distance between the position of the root tip 4 d after transplantation and the grid line where the root tip was positioned during transplantation (Supplemental Figure S1). To identify the HLB2 gene, homozygous hlb2 (Col-0 ecotype) was out-crossed to the Landsberg erecta ecotype to generate seeds for map-based cloning because attempts to identify the responsible mutation for the hlb2 phenotype using TAIL-PCR had been unsuccessful. Segregating F2 seedlings were surface sterilized as described above and grown for 3 d. These seedlings were then transferred to MS medium containing 50 nM LatB and root lengths were marked on the plates to track root growth. Transferred seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 d in the growth chamber and seedlings that showed root hypersensitivity to 50-nM LatB were selected for mapping. Briefly, DNA was extracted (Edwards et al., 1991) from approximately 2,600 LatB sensitive seedlings and cloned with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers to chromosome one between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci (Lukowitz et al., 2000), which spanned 248 kb and contained 77 annotated genes. Primers were then designed to several candidate genes based on the sequenced 248-kb region. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the hlb2 mutation had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position 720, 152–720, 161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. In addition, we obtained a T-DNA insertional mutant (SALK_065311) from the ABRC with a predicted insertion in SPI. After genotyping, SALK_065311 was subjected to similar LatB hypersensitivity and growth assays as hlb2 as mentioned above. Allelism was determined by examining the F1 progeny from a cross between hlb2 × SALK_065311. Following the nomenclature of Steffens et al. (2015), SALK_065311 and hlb2 were named spi-3 and spi-5, respectively.Generation of fluorescent protein-tagged constructs and plant lines The SPI protein was tagged at the C-terminus with the fluorescent protein 3x-YPet via the recombineering method (Zhou et al., 2011). Agrobacterium tumefaciens UIA143 pMP90 harboring a SPI-YPet recombineering construct was used to transform the spi-5 mutant by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic lines were isolated based on resistance to kanamycin and restoration of the wild-type root length. The SPI-YPet transgene was amplified with primers (5′-ATTCCACAAGCAACCAGTCAC-3′ and 5′-AACAGAGTTGAGAGTGGCTCG-3′) and sequenced to confirm the correct configuration. Final validation of SPI-YPet expression was accomplished by screening selected lines under the confocal microscope for YPet fluorescence and complementation of the short root hair phenotype. SCAR2-mCherry lines were also generated by recombineering in which an mCherry tag was fused to an internal region of SCAR2 (Sharan et al., 2009). The mCherry tag was inserted after amino acid 585 in SCAR2 to generate SCAR2-i2mCherry. Recombineering primers were designed as follows: the forward primer contained 50 SCAR2 nucleotides upstream from the insertion site of SCAR2 and 18 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the mCherry cassette, which had a 5× Glycine, 1 Alanine linker. The reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides after the insert site of SCAR2 and 24 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the mCherry cassette. The JAtY75L14 clone was transformed into the recombineering competent Escherichia coli strain SW105 and recombined with the SCAR2-i2mCherry recombineering cassettes. A flippase recombination reaction removed the ampicillin resistance marker. The sequence between the two test primers was verified by DNA sequencing. The clones were transformed into Agrobacterium and then into scar1234 plants (Dyachok et al., 2008). Because both scar1234 plants and the recombineering clones were Basta resistant, plants on MS plates were screened by eye for rescued trichome phenotypes. Rescued plants were genotyped with the recombineering test primers and screened for fluorescence under a confocal microscope. The BRK1promoter: BRK1-YFP introduced into the brk1-1 mutant and ARPC5-GFP are described in Dyachok et al. (2008) and Yanagisawa et al. (2015), respectively. For the BRK1-mRuby3 construct, the fluorescent protein 3x-mRUBY3 was tagged with a C-terminal linker (10 Alanine, Glycine) using Thermo Fisher Scientific GeneArt to include BamH1 and XbaI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Codon optimization for Arabidopsis was performed on the 3x-mRUBY3 and internal linkers prior to synthesis. The 3X-mRuby3 fragment was inserted as a BamH1/XbaI into the plasmid pBRK:YFPpEZRK (Dyachok et al., 2008).The Agrobacterium floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998) was used to transform brk1-2 plants, and transformation was confirmed when this construct fully restored defective brk1-2 trichomes. Plants expressing BRK1-YFP were crossed with spi-5 to generate BRK1-YFP in the spi-5 background. In parallel, plants expressing SPI-YPet were crossed with brk1 to obtain SPI-YPet in the brk1 background. Spi-5 was directly transformed with the UBQ10:mGFP-Lifeact construct by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Spi-5 expressing SEC-RFP was generated by crossing spi-5 with SEC7-RFP-expressing wild-type plants, and progeny in subsequent generations that exhibited fluorescence and the spi root hair phenotypes were selected for analysis.Generation of dual fluorescent protein-labeled plant lines To generate plant lines co-expressing SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3, SPI-YPet in spi-5 was crossed with BRK1-mRuby3 in the brk1-2 background. Progeny from subsequent generations that exhibited yellow and red fluorescence and rescued root hair and trichome phenotypes were selected for the analysis. For lines expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby3-Lifeact (Bascom et al., 2018b), SPI-YPet in the spi-5 background was directly transformed with a UBQ10:Lifeact-mRuby3 construct. Seedlings that showed both YPet and mRuby3 fluorescence were selected under the confocal microscope.Evaluation of root hair growth rate Seeds were surface-sterilized in ethanol and bleach as described above. To evaluate root hair growth rate, seeds were planted on 48 × 64 mm coverslips coated with 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% (w/v) Gelzan CM (Sigma Aldrich, USA) according to Dyachok et al. (2016). The coverslips were placed in 9-cm round Petri dishes and the seeds stratified at 4°C for 48 h. After stratification, the coverslip system with planted seed were kept in a 24°C growth chamber under a 14-h light (120 µmol m−2s−1)/10-h dark cycle for 5–6 d. To quantify root hair growth rate, time-lapse sequences of elongating root hairs at intervals of 10 min over a period of 60 min from a region of the primary root located between 2 and 3 mm from the root tip were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope using a 10× objective. Root hair lengths at various time points were extracted from digital images using ImageJ (v1.51) software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The displacement of the root hair tip after each 10-min interval was obtained and divided by 10 to obtain growth rate as µm/min.Chemical treatments of root hairs For BFA treatment, a stock solution of 10 mM was made by dissolving BFA powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO. Subsequently, the working solution of 50 µM was diluted in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution, and loaded into a 1-mL syringe. The BFA solution was injected directly next to the roots of 4- to 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on coverslips and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to microscopy. FM 1-43 dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 10-mM stock solution. The dye was diluted to 4 µM in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution. The dye was loaded into a 1-mL syringe, and the solution was injected next to the roots as described above.Microscopy and image analysis Live cell imaging of root hairs using confocal microscopy was performed on 4- or 5-d-old seedlings grown on the 48 mm × 64 mm coverslip system described above. Coverslips with seedlings were placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted Leica SP8-X point scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) or an UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with 40 × water (numerical aperture = 1.10) or 100 × oil (numerical aperture = 1.40) immersion objectives. SPI-YPet and YFP-BRK1 were imaged by illuminating roots growing along the coverslip surface with the 514 nm line of the SP8-XArgon laser and emission detected at 527 nm. Images of root hairs expressing SCAR2-mCherry, BRK1-mRuby3, Lifeact-mRuby, and SEC7-RFP were acquired by illumination with the tunable SP8-X white light laser (560-580 nm) and detecting emission at 610 nm. Excitation and emission parameters for GFP (GFP-ARPC5 and mGFP-Lifeact) were 488 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Time-lapse movies or single time point images were collected using Volocity acquisition version 6.3.5 (Improvision) or SPX-8 LAS software, for the UltraView and Leica SP8-X, respectively. Quantification of fluorescence from root hair images was conducted on 8-bit confocal images acquired at a single fixed focal plane that spanned the median of the cell (SPI-YPet, BRK1-YFP, SEC-RFP, and BFA and FM 1-43 treatments) or from maximum projected images (mGFP-Lifeact). For SPI-YPet and SEC-RFP, an oval region of interest (ROI) at the root hair tip was drawn and mean fluorescence within this area was acquired using ImageJ. Fluorescence was expressed as the ratio of mean fluorescence within the root tip ROI to background fluorescence. For SPI-YPet, the background used was the region adjacent to but outside of the root hair tip (Figure 1C), while for SEC-RFP, the background used was an area on the sub-apical region of the root hair tip (Figure 2F). For BRK1-YFP, a ROI was drawn along the apical-most root hair tip that was approximately 20 pixels wide using the selection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence within this area to background fluorescence was obtained (Figure 2C). For BFA, a variable ROI was selected based on the size of BFA-induced agglomerates using the selection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence was calculated based on similarly sized ROI in the cytoplasmic region. For FM 1-43 experiment, the same quantification technique as for SEC-RFP was used. Root hair growth rate data for scatter plots in Figures 1 and 5 were derived from the same root hair images in which fluorescence images were acquired under a Leica SP8-X. For the former, an image of a root hair was taken at time 0 and every 5 min thereafter. Scatter plots to determine the relationship between growth rate and tip-focused fluorescence were generated in R (R Core Team, 2019) using the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). Linear regression analysis between two variables was performed using the lme4 package in R software (Bates et al., 2015; R Core Team, 2019). Root hair growth rate for Figure 3Q was obtained directly on a Nikon TE300 from root hairs growing in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% Gelzan in 5-cm diameter round Petri dishes. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min over a period of 60 min. The growth rate refers to the displacement of the root hair tip in micrometer divided by time elapsed (min). To quantify tip-focused F-actin, 25 optical sections were taken at 0.5-µm intervals using an UltraView spinning-disc confocal microscope. Raw Ultraview Z-stacks were exported to Imaris image analysis software version 9.2.0 (Bitplane). Transverse sections of the root hair tip were obtained from Z-stacks using the surpass view interface of Imaris software and exported as 8-bit TIFF files. From these images, an ROI spanning the circular area of the root hair tip was drawn using ImageJ and mean fluorescence was extracted (Figure 3O). The ratio of the tip fluorescence to background was obtained from 18 to 21 root hairs. Pairwise t tests and ANOVA tests were performed using the lsmeans package (Lenth, 2016) in R (R Core Team, 2019). Violin plots for planar polarity in Figure 5F were designed with the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). Pairwise Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was selected to compare the shapes of two empirical cumulative distributions for planar polarity of two genotypes using the basic package in R (R Core Team, 2019). Statistical results of t tests and ANOVA are shown in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively.Accession numbers Sequence data from this article can be found in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative or GenBank/EMBL databases under the following accession numbers: SPI (AT1G03060), BRK1 (AT2G22640), SCAR1 (AT2G34150), SCAR2 (AT2G38440), SCAR3 (AT1G29170), and SCAR4 (AT5G01730)Supplemental data The following materials are available in the online version of this article.
