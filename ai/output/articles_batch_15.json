    "abstract": "Abstract The change in gravitational force has a significant effect on biological tissues and the entire organism. As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity (µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). Overall, the space environment appears to increase energy demands in response to the µG setting. Keywords: microgravity, neural stem cells, secretome, spaceflight, metabolomics, cell metabolism",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The increasing duration of space missions and consequent need to adapt to the inhospitable conditions of the space environment present new challenges to astronauts. The health and safety of present and future space travelers remains paramount. Long periods of exposure to µG may have detrimental effects on tissues and their regenerative potential, partly due to changes observed in stem cell populations [1,2]. In particular, the human brain suffers alterations in the structure and electrocortical function induced by microgravity (µG). These alterations manifest when the space crew returns to Earth as problems with motor coordination increase intracranial pressure, and a vestibular system containing otoliths is unable to sense the presence of gravity [3,4,5]. At the cellular level, Silvano et al. reported transient cell cycle arrest and cellular stress followed by apoptosis on murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs). The cells recovered their normal cell cycle and stemness upon returning to normal gravity [6]. Our own studies and those from other groups have shown an increase in cell proliferation and metabolic activity of human NSCs on a spaceflight or under simulated µG (sim- µG), in part due to an increase in mitochondrial function [7,8]. Mattei et al. studied early brain development under simulated µG using human embryonic stem cell-derived neural organoids. Although the organoids were able to form, they reported alterations in the rostral-caudal patterning, indicating that µG favors differentiation toward caudal neural progenitors [9]. The impact of a lack of gravitational force on biological systems can be observed soon after the exposure begins. After a 24 h incubation in a sim-µG, a human seminoma cell line exhibited markers of oxidative stress, such as enlarged mitochondria and increased intracellular ROS, protein and lipid oxidation, and SOD [10]. Human gastric mucosal cells showed signs of stress and inflammation following 3 days of sim-µG, whereas oxidative stress on the same cells was detected after 7 days of exposure to microgravity [11]. Our own studies on fetal human NSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) revealed increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after exposing OLPs to sim-µG for 3 days increased the TCA cycle and the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids [12]. A more detailed study on mitochondrial function in rat hippocampus was performed by Wang et al., following 7 days in a tail suspension model of microgravity. They found downregulation in mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV, in isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases, as well as upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes PRX6 and DJ-1 [13]. In this study, we sought to ascertain “gravity sensitive” small molecules secreted by NSCs after short-term exposure to space µG. Our results demonstrate that µG increases energy production, mainly through the TCA cycle, and triggers stress response mechanisms as means for adaptation.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells and Space Flight Information A homogeneous population of NSCs was obtained from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS). The original cells, known as “CS83iCTR-33nxx” (such as skin cells), were “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement, flown to the International Space Station (ISS), and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 at 37 °C. NSCs were seeded using STM culture medium designed in our laboratory [14]. For the space flight, NSCs were seeded onto mesh carriers (2 mm × 3 mm) and placed inside a Type IV cell culture chamber. They were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 at 37 °C. We used the Automated Type IV chamber intended to collect the secretome of NSCs for 3 days while in space to determine their proliferation by BrdU incorporation (Figure 1). After 3 days of incubation, the culture medium was pumped out of the cell chamber, and the units were stored at 4 °C. After splash-down, samples were transported in a controlled environment. Upon arrival to UCLA, the NSCs were retrieved from the hardware, plated onto poly-d-lysine coated flasks in our proprietary stem cell chemically defined medium (STM) [15], and allowed to recover from space flight and splash-down. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Synopsis of the automated experiments. (a) On board SpaceX-16. (b) Timeline displaying initial media change at T + 2 d after NSCs reached space. After 3 days (T + 5 d), the second culture medium was recovered into the second tank just prior to unberth, and stored at 4 °C. This conditioned medium contains the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboarding the ISS. During ascent, descent, and space flight, cells were maintained at 37 °C. Upon arrival to our laboratory, the culture media were recovered separately and placed in numbered tubes with the addition of a cocktail of proteases inhibitors, and saved frozen at −80 °C. (c) View of the cell chamber, where mesh carriers with cells and the travel culture medium travelled. (d,e) Tanks that contained the fresh medium to be released at T + 2 to start the experiment. Tank 2 (E arrow) contained the second fresh medium with which the cells came back to Earth. There was not a 1 G control onboard the space station, as tests were performed two years prior to determine the optimal conditions for the cells. The STaARS-1 EF facility was created by STaARS, inspired by this study to reduce the time astronauts would have to invest in these experiments. This facility was activated, monitored, and controlled from STaARS’ headquarters in Houston, TX. We used a total of four units that were flown aboard SpaceX-16 on 5 December 2018. Image adapted from Vergnes et al. [16]. 2.2. Secretome Collection The culture medium that fed cells during the 3 distinct time points (during the space flight, during the 3 day exposure on the ISS, and following the 3 day exposure but prior to splash-down) were recovered and saved frozen at −80 °C. This medium is commonly known as the conditioned medium and contains proteins, peptides, metabolites, and many more products usually secreted by the cells into the medium. For the purpose of this manuscript, we named this conditioned medium the “secretome”. We use the term “space CM” in comparative figures to differentiate this from conditioned medium derived from ground control or naïve cells. 2.3. Metabolomic Profile of the Secretome The metabolic profile was obtained for each group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens. Three groups of samples were compared: blank (n = 5), which consisted of the culture medium alone, incubated in the same incubator used for our cell cultures; NSCs (n = 5) in 1 G; and NSCs incubated in SPC-flown NSCs (n = 5). The secretome was subjected to methanol extraction, then split into aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative, or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards, followed by visual inspection for quality control, as previously described [17]. Random forest analysis was performed as described [18,19]. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” indicates the population mean [16]. For this study, we considered solely the molecules that presented a significant difference (p < 0.05) between groups, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00. The metabolomics study, compound identification, and statistical analysis were performed as recently published [20]. We used groups of n = 5. For SPC, 1 G, and control medium, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed with ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare between the data; p < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated, taking into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies (Q < 0.05), and was used as an indication of high confidence in the data. Both Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were also performed in ArrayStudio.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Random Forest and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis We performed metabolomic analysis on the culture medium from control Earth-grounded NSCs (GC-NSCs; 1 G) and space-flown NSCs (SPC-NSCs; 0 G). The 3D “secretome” (conditioned culture medium) was produced and collected for 3 days, starting on T + 2 and concluding on T + 5, as illustrated in Figure 1. Therefore, it contains solely the molecules secreted by NSCs while in space (active experiment). A control for changes that may occur in the culture medium under 1 G conditions was added to the analysis. In order to gain insight into the potential biomarkers produced by NSCs under the conditions of space flight vs. ground control, we used the Random Forest Analysis (RFA) approach, which uses a forest of decision trees to identify molecules that are important to predict groups. The RFA assessment of blank, ground control, and SPC-flown NSCs was very effective. The biochemical importance plot highlighted a number of amino acids and their catabolites related to glutaminolysis (Ala, Asp, Gln, alpha-ketoglutaramate), BCAA catabolism (1-carboxyethylisoleucine, 1-carboxyethylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate), nitrogen balance (urea, creatine, N-acetyl-putrescine), glucose and succinate involved in energy production, and lipids and lipid precursors (glycerol, choline, glycerophosphorylcholine) related to the synthesis of phospholipids and cellular membranes (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Random forest analysis (RFA). The assessment of blank, ground control, and SPC-flown NSCs was highly effective. The biochemical importance plot highlighted biochemicals related to a number of super family pathways: amino acids associated with glutaminolysis (Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln), amino acid metabolites from BCAA catabolism (1-carboxyethylisoleucine, 1-carboxyethylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, alpha-ketoglutaramate), metabolites from nitrogen metabolism (urea, creatine, N-acetyl-putrescine), lipids associated with metabolism of phospholipids (malonate, glycerol, choline, glycerophosphorylcholine), and nucleotide metabolism (hypoxanthine, 2′-deoxycytidine). Random forest classification using named metabolites in media of blank compared to 1 G and 0 G NSCs gave a predictive accuracy of 100%. Random chance would be expected to yield a predictive accuracy of 33%. We found two molecules with unclear identities: X25035, which is most likely a peptide, and X25865. RFA was performed as previously described [20]. 3.2. NSCs in Space (SPC-NSCs) Have High Energy Demands A total of 221 biochemicals were identified, with significantly different levels of expression between the NSCs-SPC and NSCs-GC secretomes. From them, 79 were increased and 142 were decreased in NSCs-SPC, with respect to NSCs-GC (Figure 3a). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of this data-set revealed three distinct groups of samples clustered together with a clear separation between them, indicating different biochemical profiles in each group’s secretome (Figure 3b). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Global biochemical changes. (a) The statistical comparison of metabolites secreted by NSCs during the 3 days aboard the ISS vs. those secreted by GC-NSCs revealed a total of 221 biochemical alterations, of which 79 increased and 142 decreased. This secretome was produced and collected over 3 days, starting on T + 2 and concluding on T + 5, using the automated hardware. Therefore, it contains only those molecules secreted during the 3 days onboard the ISS. Only statistically significant species were considered in the analysis. (b) Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that each of the three sample groups (NSC-SPC [red], NSC-GC [blue], and control medium [yellow]) have a different biochemical profile of its secretome after 3 days, based on its gravitational status.By grouping biochemicals by metabolic pathways, we found increased levels of glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate and a concomitant reduction in glutamine and alanine aminoacids, which indicates an increase in glutaminolysis to provide substrates to the Tri-Carboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) for generation of energy (Figure 4). We also observed increased catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and an overall reduction in mitochondrial and cytoplasmic intermediate metabolite levels at 0 G compared to cells that remained at 1 G; Tthe reduction was most evident in the cytoplasmic levels. These findings, along with the fact that levels of BCAA were similar between the two conditions, suggest recent activation of BCAA catabolism (Figure 5a). BCAA catabolism leads to the production of acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle to generate energy, and propionyl-CoA, which can be directed to either the TCA cycle or the gluconeogenesis pathway. In both cases, the main aim of BCAA catabolism is the production of energy (Figure 5b). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Glutaminolysis.

(b) Scheme of the BCAA metabolic pathways. (c) Example of the levels of 2 metabolites.We then looked at the status of the glycolytic pathway. Higher levels of pyruvate accompanied by lower levels of lactate suggested that cells preferentially utilized the glycolytic pathway for a more efficient TCA energetic pathway (Figure 6), or that lactate was used as an oxidative substrate for energy metabolism [21]. These observations are in concert with the activation of amino acids’ catabolism as a supplementary source of energy, which may indicate that NSCs-SPC require more energy to adapt to 0 G conditions.

Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Example of 2 metabolites levels. (c) Scheme of the glycolytic pathway.The NAD+/NADH system is an important player in energy metabolism, accumulating energy by reduction of NAD+ and releasing it by oxidation of NADH. Analysis of metabolic intermediates in the synthesis of NAD+ showed that 3 days in space strongly stimulated the synthesis of NAD+ through a de novo pathway as opposed to the salvage pathway, as visualized by a marked increase in nicotinate and reduction in nicotinamide intermediates (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab NADH synthesis. (a) Table depicting fold change ratio of intermediates of the NADH synthesis pathway intermediates from NSC-SPC (0 G) vs. NSC-GC (1 G) after 3 days of incubation. Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Scheme of the “de novo” and “salvage” pathways.Amino acid metabolism generates nitrogen waste metabolites. Several fates for this nitrogen exist, including incorporation into creatine or polyamines, transport to the liver via glutamine, and the subsequent production of urea. The levels of creatine, creatinine and urea are reduced in NSCs-SPC compared to NSCs-GC, despite the increased metabolism of amino acids. However, there is a significant increase in the levels of these metabolites after 39 days in space (unpublished results), which suggests that we are witnessing the beginning of the adaptive mechanism to 0 G. Interestingly, polyamine metabolism revealed a significant increase in spermidine, while its precursor putrescine and its metabolites acetylated for degradation—N-acetyl-putrescine and N-acetyl-spermidine—remained low (Figure 8). Considering the involvement of spermidine in cell homeostasis and particularly in autophagy, the increased levels after only 3 days in space may reveal another adaptive mechanism to cope with the stress imposed by low gravity. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Nitrogen Metabolism. (a) Table depicting the fold change ratio of nitrogen metabolism intermediates between 0 G vs. 1 G secretomes after 3 days of incubation. Nitrogen metabolites are divided into urea cycle, creatine metabolism, and polyamine metabolism pathways. Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Scheme of the integrated nitrogen metabolism.The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) evaluates the variable clustering patterns of the metabolites from space-flown NSCs, compared to the ground control. In addition to several amino acids (and related metabolites), the TCA metabolites alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate were higher in NSCs-SPC, consistent with an increase in energy production as discussed above. There was also a reduction in phospholipids (phosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphorylcholine) and ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutirate), with an increase in glycerol-3-phosphate, suggesting that lipids may be used as a source for energy in addition to glucose and amino acids. In the nucleotide area, there was an overall reduction in nitrogen bases and metabolic intermediaries (N-methyl adenosine, orotate, xanthine) (Figure 9). Figure 9. Open in a new tab The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) evaluates the variable clustering patterns of the metabolites from space--lown NSCs and ground control. We show the data in a table format, where the rows represent individual metabolites and the columns represent the secretome sample from which molecules were detected: STM medium (yellow), GC-NSCs (blue), and SPC-NSCs (red). The color of the cell reflects the concentration of each metabolite to its corresponding sample, relative to the mean concentration level across the entire set of tissue samples. Respectively, the colors red, blue, and white within the table indicate an increase, decrease, or no significant change of metabolites. The pathways that the metabolites belong to are indicated to the right of the HCA. The HCA compares the metabolite change between the 0 G, 1 G, and control groups. n = 5 samples per group. HCA data analysis was generated using ArrayStudio.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion The effect of microgravity on the human body has been increasingly studied over the past several decades, in part due to the higher frequency of space trips, increased duration of space missions, and planning for future space exploration involving long-term flights with humans. The change in gravitational forces, as with any modification in environmental conditions, induces adaptive responses in living organisms. Understanding the gravitational biology of specific cells and organs is essential for successful travel and long-term survival in space. A comprehensive multi-Omics study from NASA’s GeneLab analyzed tissue samples from astronauts, with data pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary and consistent alteration caused by space travel [22]. Systemic alteration in mitochondrial function causes leaking of ROS and a reduction in antioxidant defenses, leading to increased oxidative stress, which accounts for most of the disorders affecting astronauts’ health [23]. Our aim is to investigate the adaptive changes that Central Nervous System (CNS) cells experience in a µG environment. In this work we focused on neural stem cells (NSCs), which have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and contribute to maintaining the integrity and function of the nervous system in health and disease. Our previous work reported an increased proliferation of NSCs following space travel, which was accompanied by higher oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, indicating increased metabolic activity of the cells in space compared to control NSCs grounded on Earth [7]. Here, we present evidence supporting an increase in the production and consumption of energy through a metabolomic analysis of the cell culture medium. Changes in the levels of intermediates of glycolysis, such as increases in pyruvate and glycerate in the SPC-NSC culture medium, are indicators of activated glycolysis. This activates the TCA cycle for more efficient aerobic energy production, as lactate levels declined significantly in 1 G-NSCs. In line with our findings, Chiang and collaborators exposed human NSCs to simulated µG and found an increase in cell proliferation, supported by enhanced mitochondrial function [8]. In another work, cultures of human biliary stem cells in simulated µG (sim- µG) also displayed activation of the glycolytic pathway, although with the production of fermentation and ketosis byproducts [24]. We have previously reported that simulated µG triggered increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis in another CNS population, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), as soon as 24 h after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after 3 days of exposure of OLPs to sim-μG confirmed increased activity in the TCA cycle [25] flux in sim-μG [26]. It appears that soon after being exposed to sim-μG, cells have an acute increase in their need for energy, stimulating glycolysis and leading toward the less efficient anaerobic path, with higher lactic acid production. As the energy demands remain high, the glycolytic pathway transitions toward the TCA aerobic pathway. In the present study, another indication of the increase in demand and production of energy elicited by µG is demonstrated by the active catabolism of BCAA observed in SPC-NSC, as the end products acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA also serve as substrates for the TCA cycle. Furthermore, the amino acid glutamine renders alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA intermediary that is poured into the cycle to increase energy production. As more energy is required by cells in µG, more NAD is needed, as the NAD/NADH system is an essential player in energy metabolism. Energy is necessary for all cellular processes and NAD+ plays a key role as an effector substrate for sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38 which trigger signaling processes to maintain tissue physiology under environmental stresses [27]. As subproducts of amino acid catabolism, the polyamine spermidine plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and is involved in cell growth and proliferation, tissue regeneration, DNA and RNA stabilization, enzymatic modulation, and regulation of translation, among others [28,29,30]. More importantly, it induces autophagy through inhibition of several acetyltransferases, including EP300 [31,32]. Via time-lapse microscopy, we observed significant activation of autophagy-like behavior in our cells upon return from space, and by proteomic analysis of NSCs-SPC secretome (manuscript submitted for publication). However, we have exhausted our current samples, and would require a second space flight in order to elucidate whether the phenomenon observed is indeed autophagy. The occurrence of autophagy has also been described in ARPE19 retina cells exposed to sim-μG, where an increase in the production of ROS and mitochondria dysfunction led to the activation of autophagy, and mitophagy [24]. Most of the studies on short-term exposure to microgravity were carried out on sim-µG on the Earth’s surface. Our study was carried out onboard the ISS, and samples were also exposed to all the stresses a biological system experiences during the space flight. However, one limitation of this study is the lack of a NSC culture at 1 G onboard the ISS to control for stress from takeoff and travel, as well as for ionizing radiation. Ionizing Radiation (IR) and μG exposure act synergistically in space, producing interactions between adaptive pathways and defense responses [33]. IR generates ROS/RNS, giving rise to oxidative stress and damage [1,34]. This poses a risk for the CNS, due to its high sensitivity to oxidative injury in the context of elevated levels of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, and low levels of antioxidant defenses. In a mouse spleen model of low dose radiation exposure, γ-radiation, or high energy particle radiation, the authors observed enrichment of metabolites involved in purine metabolism, TCA, fatty acids, acylcarnitine, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the γ irradiated samples, while later responses shifted towards more prominent responses in groups with high energy particle irradiations, suggesting a mitochondrial implication and possible long-term effects on DNA repair [35]. The added effect of IR to sim-µG was reported by Mao et al. in a study performed in mice brains exposed to either low-dose γ-radiation or hindlimb suspension (model for sim-µG), or to both conditions, for 21 days. Higher levels of oxidative stress and NADP oxidase 2, and lower levels of SOD were observed in the combined treatment group [35]. The potential influence of IR on the NSCs in our study is likely mitigated by the short-term exposure of the NSCs to IR and the protection that the Earth’s magnetic field exerts against Solar Particle Events, since the ISS is in a low Earth orbit, although it does not shield from Galactic Cosmic Radiation, which is composed of high-charge and energy particles. In conclusion, microgravity poses numerous challenges to the health of astronauts, and the central nervous system is not exempt. The lack of gravity induces a stress response in NSCs, with a resultant increase in energy production and autophagy-like behavior. This may have important implications in the planning of future space travel, especially for trips of extended duration, to ensure that astronauts have sufficient energy available to sustain CNS homeostasis and to optimize their cognitive and physiological function under times of increased stress.",

As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity (µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). Overall, the space environment appears to increase energy demands in response to the µG setting. Keywords: microgravity, neural stem cells, secretome, spaceflight, metabolomics, cell metabolism1. Introduction The increasing duration of space missions and consequent need to adapt to the inhospitable conditions of the space environment present new challenges to astronauts. The health and safety of present and future space travelers remains paramount. Long periods of exposure to µG may have detrimental effects on tissues and their regenerative potential, partly due to changes observed in stem cell populations [1,2]. In particular, the human brain suffers alterations in the structure and electrocortical function induced by microgravity (µG). These alterations manifest when the space crew returns to Earth as problems with motor coordination increase intracranial pressure, and a vestibular system containing otoliths is unable to sense the presence of gravity [3,4,5]. At the cellular level, Silvano et al. reported transient cell cycle arrest and cellular stress followed by apoptosis on murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs). The cells recovered their normal cell cycle and stemness upon returning to normal gravity [6]. Our own studies and those from other groups have shown an increase in cell proliferation and metabolic activity of human NSCs on a spaceflight or under simulated µG (sim- µG), in part due to an increase in mitochondrial function [7,8]. Mattei et al. studied early brain development under simulated µG using human embryonic stem cell-derived neural organoids. Although the organoids were able to form, they reported alterations in the rostral-caudal patterning, indicating that µG favors differentiation toward caudal neural progenitors [9]. The impact of a lack of gravitational force on biological systems can be observed soon after the exposure begins. After a 24 h incubation in a sim-µG, a human seminoma cell line exhibited markers of oxidative stress, such as enlarged mitochondria and increased intracellular ROS, protein and lipid oxidation, and SOD [10]. Human gastric mucosal cells showed signs of stress and inflammation following 3 days of sim-µG, whereas oxidative stress on the same cells was detected after 7 days of exposure to microgravity [11]. Our own studies on fetal human NSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) revealed increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after exposing OLPs to sim-µG for 3 days increased the TCA cycle and the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids [12]. A more detailed study on mitochondrial function in rat hippocampus was performed by Wang et al., following 7 days in a tail suspension model of microgravity. They found downregulation in mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV, in isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases, as well as upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes PRX6 and DJ-1 [13]. In this study, we sought to ascertain “gravity sensitive” small molecules secreted by NSCs after short-term exposure to space µG. Our results demonstrate that µG increases energy production, mainly through the TCA cycle, and triggers stress response mechanisms as means for adaptation.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells and Space Flight Information A homogeneous population of NSCs was obtained from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS). The original cells, known as “CS83iCTR-33nxx” (such as skin cells), were “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement, flown to the International Space Station (ISS), and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 at 37 °C. NSCs were seeded using STM culture medium designed in our laboratory [14]. For the space flight, NSCs were seeded onto mesh carriers (2 mm × 3 mm) and placed inside a Type IV cell culture chamber. They were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 at 37 °C. We used the Automated Type IV chamber intended to collect the secretome of NSCs for 3 days while in space to determine their proliferation by BrdU incorporation (Figure 1). After 3 days of incubation, the culture medium was pumped out of the cell chamber, and the units were stored at 4 °C. After splash-down, samples were transported in a controlled environment. Upon arrival to UCLA, the NSCs were retrieved from the hardware, plated onto poly-d-lysine coated flasks in our proprietary stem cell chemically defined medium (STM) [15], and allowed to recover from space flight and splash-down. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Synopsis of the automated experiments. (a) On board SpaceX-16. (b) Timeline displaying initial media change at T + 2 d after NSCs reached space. After 3 days (T + 5 d), the second culture medium was recovered into the second tank just prior to unberth, and stored at 4 °C. This conditioned medium contains the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboarding the ISS. During ascent, descent, and space flight, cells were maintained at 37 °C. Upon arrival to our laboratory, the culture media were recovered separately and placed in numbered tubes with the addition of a cocktail of proteases inhibitors, and saved frozen at −80 °C.

Tank 2 (E arrow) contained the second fresh medium with which the cells came back to Earth. There was not a 1 G control onboard the space station, as tests were performed two years prior to determine the optimal conditions for the cells. The STaARS-1 EF facility was created by STaARS, inspired by this study to reduce the time astronauts would have to invest in these experiments. This facility was activated, monitored, and controlled from STaARS’ headquarters in Houston, TX. We used a total of four units that were flown aboard SpaceX-16 on 5 December 2018. Image adapted from Vergnes et al. [16].2.2. Secretome Collection The culture medium that fed cells during the 3 distinct time points (during the space flight, during the 3 day exposure on the ISS, and following the 3 day exposure but prior to splash-down) were recovered and saved frozen at −80 °C. This medium is commonly known as the conditioned medium and contains proteins, peptides, metabolites, and many more products usually secreted by the cells into the medium. For the purpose of this manuscript, we named this conditioned medium the “secretome”. We use the term “space CM” in comparative figures to differentiate this from conditioned medium derived from ground control or naïve cells.2.3. Metabolomic Profile of the Secretome The metabolic profile was obtained for each group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens. Three groups of samples were compared: blank (n = 5), which consisted of the culture medium alone, incubated in the same incubator used for our cell cultures; NSCs (n = 5) in 1 G; and NSCs incubated in SPC-flown NSCs (n = 5). The secretome was subjected to methanol extraction, then split into aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative, or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards, followed by visual inspection for quality control, as previously described [17]. Random forest analysis was performed as described [18,19]. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” indicates the population mean [16]. For this study, we considered solely the molecules that presented a significant difference (p < 0.05) between groups, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00. The metabolomics study, compound identification, and statistical analysis were performed as recently published [20]. We used groups of n = 5. For SPC, 1 G, and control medium, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed with ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare between the data; p < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated, taking into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies (Q < 0.05), and was used as an indication of high confidence in the data. Both Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were also performed in ArrayStudio.3. Results 3.1. Random Forest and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis We performed metabolomic analysis on the culture medium from control Earth-grounded NSCs (GC-NSCs; 1 G) and space-flown NSCs (SPC-NSCs; 0 G). The 3D “secretome” (conditioned culture medium) was produced and collected for 3 days, starting on T + 2 and concluding on T + 5, as illustrated in Figure 1. Therefore, it contains solely the molecules secreted by NSCs while in space (active experiment). A control for changes that may occur in the culture medium under 1 G conditions was added to the analysis. In order to gain insight into the potential biomarkers produced by NSCs under the conditions of space flight vs. ground control, we used the Random Forest Analysis (RFA) approach, which uses a forest of decision trees to identify molecules that are important to predict groups. The RFA assessment of blank, ground control, and SPC-flown NSCs was very effective. The biochemical importance plot highlighted a number of amino acids and their catabolites related to glutaminolysis (Ala, Asp, Gln, alpha-ketoglutaramate), BCAA catabolism (1-carboxyethylisoleucine, 1-carboxyethylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate), nitrogen balance (urea, creatine, N-acetyl-putrescine), glucose and succinate involved in energy production, and lipids and lipid precursors (glycerol, choline, glycerophosphorylcholine) related to the synthesis of phospholipids and cellular membranes (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Random forest analysis (RFA). The assessment of blank, ground control, and SPC-flown NSCs was highly effective. The biochemical importance plot highlighted biochemicals related to a number of super family pathways: amino acids associated with glutaminolysis (Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln), amino acid metabolites from BCAA catabolism (1-carboxyethylisoleucine, 1-carboxyethylvaline, 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, alpha-ketoglutaramate), metabolites from nitrogen metabolism (urea, creatine, N-acetyl-putrescine), lipids associated with metabolism of phospholipids (malonate, glycerol, choline, glycerophosphorylcholine), and nucleotide metabolism (hypoxanthine, 2′-deoxycytidine). Random forest classification using named metabolites in media of blank compared to 1 G and 0 G NSCs gave a predictive accuracy of 100%. Random chance would be expected to yield a predictive accuracy of 33%. We found two molecules with unclear identities: X25035, which is most likely a peptide, and X25865. RFA was performed as previously described [20].3.2. NSCs in Space (SPC-NSCs) Have High Energy Demands A total of 221 biochemicals were identified, with significantly different levels of expression between the NSCs-SPC and NSCs-GC secretomes. From them, 79 were increased and 142 were decreased in NSCs-SPC, with respect to NSCs-GC (Figure 3a). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of this data-set revealed three distinct groups of samples clustered together with a clear separation between them, indicating different biochemical profiles in each group’s secretome (Figure 3b). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Global biochemical changes. (a) The statistical comparison of metabolites secreted by NSCs during the 3 days aboard the ISS vs. those secreted by GC-NSCs revealed a total of 221 biochemical alterations, of which 79 increased and 142 decreased. This secretome was produced and collected over 3 days, starting on T + 2 and concluding on T + 5, using the automated hardware. Therefore, it contains only those molecules secreted during the 3 days onboard the ISS. Only statistically significant species were considered in the analysis. (b) Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that each of the three sample groups (NSC-SPC [red], NSC-GC [blue], and control medium [yellow]) have a different biochemical profile of its secretome after 3 days, based on its gravitational status.By grouping biochemicals by metabolic pathways, we found increased levels of glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate and a concomitant reduction in glutamine and alanine aminoacids, which indicates an increase in glutaminolysis to provide substrates to the Tri-Carboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) for generation of energy (Figure 4). We also observed increased catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and an overall reduction in mitochondrial and cytoplasmic intermediate metabolite levels at 0 G compared to cells that remained at 1 G; Tthe reduction was most evident in the cytoplasmic levels. These findings, along with the fact that levels of BCAA were similar between the two conditions, suggest recent activation of BCAA catabolism (Figure 5a). BCAA catabolism leads to the production of acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle to generate energy, and propionyl-CoA, which can be directed to either the TCA cycle or the gluconeogenesis pathway. In both cases, the main aim of BCAA catabolism is the production of energy (Figure 5b). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Glutaminolysis.

(b) Scheme of the BCAA metabolic pathways. (c) Example of the levels of 2 metabolites.We then looked at the status of the glycolytic pathway. Higher levels of pyruvate accompanied by lower levels of lactate suggested that cells preferentially utilized the glycolytic pathway for a more efficient TCA energetic pathway (Figure 6), or that lactate was used as an oxidative substrate for energy metabolism [21]. These observations are in concert with the activation of amino acids’ catabolism as a supplementary source of energy, which may indicate that NSCs-SPC require more energy to adapt to 0 G conditions. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Glycolysis. (a) Table displaying fold change ratio of the glycolytic pathway metabolites at 3 days of 0 G vs. 1 G NCS secretome. Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Example of 2 metabolites levels. (c) Scheme of the glycolytic pathway.The NAD+/NADH system is an important player in energy metabolism, accumulating energy by reduction of NAD+ and releasing it by oxidation of NADH. Analysis of metabolic intermediates in the synthesis of NAD+ showed that 3 days in space strongly stimulated the synthesis of NAD+ through a de novo pathway as opposed to the salvage pathway, as visualized by a marked increase in nicotinate and reduction in nicotinamide intermediates (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab NADH synthesis. (a) Table depicting fold change ratio of intermediates of the NADH synthesis pathway intermediates from NSC-SPC (0 G) vs. NSC-GC (1 G) after 3 days of incubation. Values in red rectangles represent increased levels of the metabolites in space compared to ground control, whereas green rectangles highlight the opposite and white rectangles represent no change. (b) Scheme of the “de novo” and “salvage” pathways.Amino acid metabolism generates nitrogen waste metabolites. Several fates for this nitrogen exist, including incorporation into creatine or polyamines, transport to the liver via glutamine, and the subsequent production of urea. The levels of creatine, creatinine and urea are reduced in NSCs-SPC compared to NSCs-GC, despite the increased metabolism of amino acids. However, there is a significant increase in the levels of these metabolites after 39 days in space (unpublished results), which suggests that we are witnessing the beginning of the adaptive mechanism to 0 G. Interestingly, polyamine metabolism revealed a significant increase in spermidine, while its precursor putrescine and its metabolites acetylated for degradation—N-acetyl-putrescine and N-acetyl-spermidine—remained low (Figure 8). Considering the involvement of spermidine in cell homeostasis and particularly in autophagy, the increased levels after only 3 days in space may reveal another adaptive mechanism to cope with the stress imposed by low gravity. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Nitrogen Metabolism. (a) Table depicting the fold change ratio of nitrogen metabolism intermediates between 0 G vs. 1 G secretomes after 3 days of incubation. Nitrogen metabolites are divided into urea cycle, creatine metabolism, and polyamine metabolism pathways.

(b) Scheme of the integrated nitrogen metabolism.The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) evaluates the variable clustering patterns of the metabolites from space-flown NSCs, compared to the ground control. In addition to several amino acids (and related metabolites), the TCA metabolites alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate were higher in NSCs-SPC, consistent with an increase in energy production as discussed above. There was also a reduction in phospholipids (phosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphorylcholine) and ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutirate), with an increase in glycerol-3-phosphate, suggesting that lipids may be used as a source for energy in addition to glucose and amino acids. In the nucleotide area, there was an overall reduction in nitrogen bases and metabolic intermediaries (N-methyl adenosine, orotate, xanthine) (Figure 9). Figure 9. Open in a new tab The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) evaluates the variable clustering patterns of the metabolites from space--lown NSCs and ground control. We show the data in a table format, where the rows represent individual metabolites and the columns represent the secretome sample from which molecules were detected: STM medium (yellow), GC-NSCs (blue), and SPC-NSCs (red). The color of the cell reflects the concentration of each metabolite to its corresponding sample, relative to the mean concentration level across the entire set of tissue samples. Respectively, the colors red, blue, and white within the table indicate an increase, decrease, or no significant change of metabolites. The pathways that the metabolites belong to are indicated to the right of the HCA. The HCA compares the metabolite change between the 0 G, 1 G, and control groups. n = 5 samples per group. HCA data analysis was generated using ArrayStudio.4. Discussion The effect of microgravity on the human body has been increasingly studied over the past several decades, in part due to the higher frequency of space trips, increased duration of space missions, and planning for future space exploration involving long-term flights with humans. The change in gravitational forces, as with any modification in environmental conditions, induces adaptive responses in living organisms. Understanding the gravitational biology of specific cells and organs is essential for successful travel and long-term survival in space. A comprehensive multi-Omics study from NASA’s GeneLab analyzed tissue samples from astronauts, with data pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary and consistent alteration caused by space travel [22]. Systemic alteration in mitochondrial function causes leaking of ROS and a reduction in antioxidant defenses, leading to increased oxidative stress, which accounts for most of the disorders affecting astronauts’ health [23]. Our aim is to investigate the adaptive changes that Central Nervous System (CNS) cells experience in a µG environment. In this work we focused on neural stem cells (NSCs), which have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and contribute to maintaining the integrity and function of the nervous system in health and disease. Our previous work reported an increased proliferation of NSCs following space travel, which was accompanied by higher oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, indicating increased metabolic activity of the cells in space compared to control NSCs grounded on Earth [7]. Here, we present evidence supporting an increase in the production and consumption of energy through a metabolomic analysis of the cell culture medium. Changes in the levels of intermediates of glycolysis, such as increases in pyruvate and glycerate in the SPC-NSC culture medium, are indicators of activated glycolysis. This activates the TCA cycle for more efficient aerobic energy production, as lactate levels declined significantly in 1 G-NSCs. In line with our findings, Chiang and collaborators exposed human NSCs to simulated µG and found an increase in cell proliferation, supported by enhanced mitochondrial function [8]. In another work, cultures of human biliary stem cells in simulated µG (sim- µG) also displayed activation of the glycolytic pathway, although with the production of fermentation and ketosis byproducts [24]. We have previously reported that simulated µG triggered increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis in another CNS population, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), as soon as 24 h after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after 3 days of exposure of OLPs to sim-μG confirmed increased activity in the TCA cycle [25] flux in sim-μG [26]. It appears that soon after being exposed to sim-μG, cells have an acute increase in their need for energy, stimulating glycolysis and leading toward the less efficient anaerobic path, with higher lactic acid production. As the energy demands remain high, the glycolytic pathway transitions toward the TCA aerobic pathway. In the present study, another indication of the increase in demand and production of energy elicited by µG is demonstrated by the active catabolism of BCAA observed in SPC-NSC, as the end products acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA also serve as substrates for the TCA cycle. Furthermore, the amino acid glutamine renders alpha-ketoglutarate, a TCA intermediary that is poured into the cycle to increase energy production. As more energy is required by cells in µG, more NAD is needed, as the NAD/NADH system is an essential player in energy metabolism. Energy is necessary for all cellular processes and NAD+ plays a key role as an effector substrate for sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38 which trigger signaling processes to maintain tissue physiology under environmental stresses [27]. As subproducts of amino acid catabolism, the polyamine spermidine plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and is involved in cell growth and proliferation, tissue regeneration, DNA and RNA stabilization, enzymatic modulation, and regulation of translation, among others [28,29,30]. More importantly, it induces autophagy through inhibition of several acetyltransferases, including EP300 [31,32]. Via time-lapse microscopy, we observed significant activation of autophagy-like behavior in our cells upon return from space, and by proteomic analysis of NSCs-SPC secretome (manuscript submitted for publication). However, we have exhausted our current samples, and would require a second space flight in order to elucidate whether the phenomenon observed is indeed autophagy. The occurrence of autophagy has also been described in ARPE19 retina cells exposed to sim-μG, where an increase in the production of ROS and mitochondria dysfunction led to the activation of autophagy, and mitophagy [24]. Most of the studies on short-term exposure to microgravity were carried out on sim-µG on the Earth’s surface. Our study was carried out onboard the ISS, and samples were also exposed to all the stresses a biological system experiences during the space flight. However, one limitation of this study is the lack of a NSC culture at 1 G onboard the ISS to control for stress from takeoff and travel, as well as for ionizing radiation. Ionizing Radiation (IR) and μG exposure act synergistically in space, producing interactions between adaptive pathways and defense responses [33]. IR generates ROS/RNS, giving rise to oxidative stress and damage [1,34]. This poses a risk for the CNS, due to its high sensitivity to oxidative injury in the context of elevated levels of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, and low levels of antioxidant defenses. In a mouse spleen model of low dose radiation exposure, γ-radiation, or high energy particle radiation, the authors observed enrichment of metabolites involved in purine metabolism, TCA, fatty acids, acylcarnitine, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the γ irradiated samples, while later responses shifted towards more prominent responses in groups with high energy particle irradiations, suggesting a mitochondrial implication and possible long-term effects on DNA repair [35]. The added effect of IR to sim-µG was reported by Mao et al. in a study performed in mice brains exposed to either low-dose γ-radiation or hindlimb suspension (model for sim-µG), or to both conditions, for 21 days. Higher levels of oxidative stress and NADP oxidase 2, and lower levels of SOD were observed in the combined treatment group [35]. The potential influence of IR on the NSCs in our study is likely mitigated by the short-term exposure of the NSCs to IR and the protection that the Earth’s magnetic field exerts against Solar Particle Events, since the ISS is in a low Earth orbit, although it does not shield from Galactic Cosmic Radiation, which is composed of high-charge and energy particles. In conclusion, microgravity poses numerous challenges to the health of astronauts, and the central nervous system is not exempt. The lack of gravity induces a stress response in NSCs, with a resultant increase in energy production and autophagy-like behavior. This may have important implications in the planning of future space travel, especially for trips of extended duration, to ensure that astronauts have sufficient energy available to sustain CNS homeostasis and to optimize their cognitive and physiological function under times of increased stress.Acknowledgments We are grateful to the NASA Space Biology Project team at Ames Research Center, David Tomko, Kevin Sato, Elizabeth Taylor, ARC Space Biology Project Manager, the support personnel at the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, and to Anne Sescleifer for revising the manuscript.Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.E.-J.; methodology, A.E.-J.; formal analysis, J.C.B.; writing—original draft preparation, J.C.B.; writing—review and editing, A.E.-J.; funding acquisition, A.E.-J.

    "introduction": "Introduction Future exploration class space expeditions will be some of the most difficult, dangerous, and dynamic operations in the history of mankind, ranging from Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration. They will push the limits of human performance and critically rely on the integrity of a range of organ systems and functions. With the advent of longer spaceflight missions space agencies have recognized the importance of better understanding the effects of environmental, operational, and psychological hazards during exploratory class missions on brain and behavior. The potential damage to neural structures in response to spaceflight and its behavioral implications are not well understood. At the same time adverse behavioral conditions, psychiatric disorders, and sensorimotor deficits are considered some of the most serious but also least understood risks during future long-duration space missions. Many other spaceflight risks are ranked lower or have been mitigated. In addition to the physiological effects of microgravity, the spacecraft setting can involve exposure to multiple environmental toxicants and operational stressors1 that all have the potential to affect neurobehavioral performance (Fig. 1). Behavioral health and performance are governed by an interplay between the central nervous system (CNS), the environment and individual phenotypes that is characterized by constantly updating and balancing genetic, molecular, cellular, physiological and cognitive demands and resources. The CNS, and particularly the brain, have emerged as a pivotal area of research because of their vulnerability to various spaceflight stressors. There is increasing evidence that spaceflight is associated with various adaptations of the brain, including intracranial fluid shifts, gray matter changes, white matter declines, and sensory reweighting and neural compensation2. However, the exact changes in brain structure and function and their meaning and mechanisms, as well as the role of mission duration, sex, and phenotypic vulnerabilities are unknown. Likewise, data on the implications of brain changes relative to behavioral and operational risks are lacking. Given that errors, misjudgments, and accidents may have serious consequences, and can lead to loss of expensive equipment and compromise mission success, identifying and predicting the effects of spaceflight on human performance and understanding their neural correlates and molecular fingerprints will be critical for successful future exploration class missions3,4.

Next, we address potential countermeasures to mitigate these risks. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs, and how addressing these knowledge gaps can benefit people and industrial applications on Earth.Key knowledge gaps Brain and behavior—which cognitive domains are affected? There is now considerable evidence that spaceflight conditions can negatively affect the brain. Koppelmans and colleagues (2016) reported extensive volumetric gray matter decreases, including large areas covering the temporal and frontal poles and around the orbits in response to spaceflight5. The same research group also observed white structural disruption in areas critical for visuo-motor control and higher-order visuo-spatial processing after spaceflight6. Notably, other groups reported increases in white matter immediately after spaceflight that persisted seven months after return to Earth7. Robust effects have also been observed for ventricular volume expansions8–13, which did not return to preflight levels six months9,13 and even up to one year after landing10. The implications of these changes on human performance and behavior are unclear. Some of the most robust effects have been found for postural control. Using task functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Hupfeld and colleagues (2022) demonstrated widespread reductions in cortical deactivation in somatosensory and visual areas after spaceflight that were associated with postural changes in balance decline14. Likewise, it was also shown that spaceflight-induced changes in cortical thickness of vestibular and sensorimotor regions, including the posterior insula and the superior temporal gyrus, predicted postural balance performance15. The effects on cognitive performance (as compared to sensorimotor control) are less clear16. While various neurobehavioral effects have been observed in response to specific spaceflight stressors (e.g., sleep deprivation, hypoxia, hypercapnia and irradiation), most data collected during spaceflight show stability, or performance increases throughout the mission17,18. The inconclusive findings can at least somewhat be attributed to study designs and methodological limitations such as mission duration, the type of tasks to assess cognitive performance, and the number and spacing of data sampling time points. For instance, Moore and colleagues (2019) observed significant impairments in manual dexterity, degradation in manual tracking, during dual tasking, and a car driving simulator task immediately upon return from space19. Notably, the effects recovered quickly (3–5 days post-landing), and the authors attributed their findings to post-flight blunting in low-frequency (‘tilt’) otolith function in addition to fatigue and environmental factors unique to prolonged stays in a spacecraft (e.g., increased CO2 levels, altered day/night cycles, high workload, confined space)19. Such effects could have a profound impact on operator proficiency such as controling a vehicle during the exploration of novel terrains, or performing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. It may also be possible that certain effects are delayed, and are only detected after weeks to months. For example, the NASA Twin Study showed that year-long human spaceflight does not immediately affect cognitive performance but reveals some adverse effects 6 months after return to Earth20. The temporal dynamics of cognitive performance trajectories during and after spaceflight are still to be explored. Along the same lines it is unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship between neurobehavioral adaptations and mission duration. It is therefore critical that future studies will go beyond 6-month duration missions, and consider following up space crews throughout the recovery of plus one year. Previous cognitive assessments also seem to have been driven by classical neuropsychological test paradigms. It is possible that spaceflight would benefit from more complex tasks that are specifically targeted to the astronaut population, and capture cognitive domains associated with visuo-spatial processing that are expected to be tightly coupled with operational tasks5,6. Moreover, it is expected that such tasks could be relevantly affected by gravitational changes because its close link to the vestibular system, which goes beyond maintaining gaze and balance. Interactions between the otoliths and semicircular canals critically contribute to spatial perception including self-motion, orientation, and navigation. It is possible that weightlessness affects various visuo-spatial abilities because of reduced gravitational stimulation. For example, it is known that spaceflight causes changes various vestibular responses leading to orientation illusions, sensory localization errors, and changes in vestibulo-ocular reflexes21. Cognitive tasks involving the neurovestibular system such as mental rotation22, perceived orientation23, and distance judgments24 are also affected during spaceflight. Some astronauts have reported a \"time compression syndrome\" in orbit25. They also require more time than normal to perform standard mental activity26,27. Previous microgravity research has also demonstrated the effects of weightlessness on posture, gaze, functional mobility, and spatial orientation, reporting misperceptions of visual orientation, depth and distance, and difficulties in shape recognition28. It is expected that any impairments in visuo-spatial abilities will also have adverse effects on spatial navigation performance. Given that the perception of self-motion depends on integrating visual information with gravitational cues processed by the vestibular system, spatial updating deficits are expected when gravity levels change. Data from parabolic flights though show that both micro- and hypergravity can lead to less precise spatial updating, a fundamental ability underlying spatial navigation29. This prediction is also in line with emerging evidence highlighting the cortical projections of the vestibular system. Given the pivotal role of visuo-spatial abilities and time evaluation for mapping spatial relationships and operations such as docking, landing, and exploring and navigating in new environments and on planets with low gravity, it is imperative to understand the impact of spaceflight on spatial cognition and its neural basis. One of the key brain areas for mapping spatial relationships and performing navigational tasks is the hippocampus30. Animal data suggest that the hippocampus and related brain structures (i.e., parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices) could be particularly vulnerable to the stressors associated with long-duration spaceflight such as radiation31, increased CO2 levels32, vestibular dysfunction33, stress34, sleep deprivation35, and isolation and confinement36,37. The effects of prolonged isolation and confinement on hippocampal plasticity have been demonstrated in humans, revealing significant reductions in dentate gyrus volume which were associated with reductions in key neurotrophins and adverse cognitive effects38. It is possible that the physiological effects of microgravity, environmental toxicants, and operational stressors interact and aggravate the consequences on brain plasticity during long-duration space missions.Sex as a biological variable It is also unclear whether neurobehavioral differences in response to spaceflight are characterized by sex- and genetic-specific adaptations. For instance, on Earth there is little doubt that spatial navigation and its neural circuitry are characterized by sex-specific differences [e.g.,39–41]. It is unclear whether such differences also exist in astronauts, and if and to what extent spatial navigation and related brain changes are differently affected after spaceflight in men and women. In fact, our current understanding of neurobiological sex differences associated with spaceflight is critically limited because of the significant disproportion of sexes enrolled in previous astronaut corps. According to our best knowledge there are currently no data comparing brain changes between male and female astronauts. Elucidating the effect of sex is mandatory to fully understand brain plasticity and behavior and their molecular mechanisms42,43. This notion is in line with the world’s leading research centers to consider sex as a biological variable44, and the space agencies’ goal to increasingly strengthen the role of women in future space expeditions. For instance, the newest class of NASA astronaut candidates included almost 50% women45. In 2020 astronaut Christina Koch broke the record for the single longest spaceflight by a woman. With 328 days in space, she is among the top five all-time records for the longest single spaceflight. NASA also announced that the next person on Moon and the first person on Mars will likely be a woman46. Due to the increasing and essential role of women in future space missions, studies of both men and women are critically needed to better understand sex-dependent vulnerabilities to adverse neurobehavioral effects during future exploratory space expeditions such as a mission to Mars.Neurobiology A central tenet of neuroscience is the cellular understanding of nervous system functions. Although great strides in quantifying the effects of spaceflight on neuronal physiology have been made, and despite the numerous constraints of space research47, a more synoptic understanding of the effects of altered gravity, space radiation, and prolonged spaceflight on the morphology and physiology of the various cell types of the nervous system and their synapses will be important to the success of future long-duration missions to the Moon or Mars. Morphological and functional alterations at the synapse could result in physiological impairments which fundamentally alter information processing in the nervous system. A more comprehensive understanding of spaceflight-induced physiological and structural alterations at the synapse and synaptic active zones, as well as the resulting changes in short and long-term plasticity and neurotransmitter homeostasis, are just a few of the relevant topics that need to be addressed in the years to come. These questions are not just relevant to glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic transmission but should be investigated in all relevant neurotransmitter systems (adenosinergic, glycinergic, histaminergic, monoaminergic) as well as the neuropeptides and gaseous signaling molecules. Details regarding the effects of spaceflight on the nervous system have been poorly described so far. Animal experiments offer great potential to better understand the mechanisms underlying the neuronal responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight can significantly affect neuronal morphology and clearance of neuronal trash, highlighting the need to carefully assess the risks of long-duration spaceflight on the nervous system. Micro- and hypergravity responsive gene signatures identified several candidate targets with terrestrial roles in neuronal function and/or cellular metabolism, which are linked to regulation by daf-16/FOXO signaling. This could help to understand the basis of spaceflight-induced maladaptation. Given the sparse availability of samples, the use of integrative omics technologies in multidimensional longitudinal studies to quantify metabolites, gene expression, and DNA methylation as well as DNA, RNA, protein, and chromatin dynamics after exposure to long-duration spaceflight will be paramount for furthering the understanding of space induced changes in cellular neurobiology20.Internal representation of gravity Future crewed missions to the Moon and Mars will expose astronauts to varying levels of gravity. The neurophysiological responses to changing hypogravity (i.e., between 0 and 1 g) and hypergravity levels (i.e., > 1 g) are poorly understood. Gravity plays a fundamental role in human behavior and performance by providing critical cues to the vestibular system (see also discussion above) and supporting the concept of verticality (which way is “up” or “down”). The otolith organs detect linear, i.e., inertial and gravitational, accelerations acting on our bodies48–50. In microgravity, the gravitational force vector, which is predominantly sensed via the otolith organs (saccule > utricle), no longer acts as a sensory reference. The resulting mismatch between the vestibular, and the visual, proprioceptive and other sensorimotor signals can affect spatial orientation, hand-eye coordination, vertical but not horizontal oculomotor behavior, postural control and self-motion perception (for a comprehensive overview see Clément et al., 2020)51. The earliest symptom for this sensory mismatch phenomenon and modulation of otolith function is the elevated susceptibility for motion sickness during parabolic flight as well as during the first days of exposure to microgravity and upon return to Earth after a long-duration space mission52. This is most likely an adaptation process associated with the altered integration and interaction of information from the semicircular canals and the otolith organs. It is known that spaceflight causes various changes in several vestibular downstream responses including transient core level modulations in vestibulo-ocular reflexes21 leading to room tilt illusions and sensory localization errors. When tasks are performed during or shortly after any gravitational transitions sudden head movements especially in the yaw plane are not advised, further highlighting the role of canal-otolith integration. Gravitational transitions can also induce aftereffects that will persist for some time after as the neurovestibular systems adapt to the new gravito-inertial loading. These neurological phenomena have been shown to impair behavior and performance across dimensions. While many studies have demonstrated that humans and animals eventually adapt to new gravitational environments (mostly microgravity)53, only a few have addressed the re-adaptation processes following re-entry: astronauts also experience a condition called “entry motion sickness”, which slows the speed of decision making and alters their ability to control the vehicle and their movements54. Neurovestibular challenges that occur when the crew member returns to normal gravity include alterations in manual control20, inability to exit the vehicle55, postural imbalance56, and locomotion disorders57. The first three weeks in space and the first two weeks back on Earth present critical adaptation periods that are characterized by impairments in perceptual-motor skills and higher attentional processes. However, the dynamics of re-adaptation when transitioning back to the original environment (e.g., 1 g) or to a new gravity level (e.g., Moon or Mars) is not well understood. This lack of knowledge may be partially explained by current methodological limitations and operational constraints; it is extremely challenging to collect data during or upon entry in a new environment or immediately after landing. The quantification of the dynamics of sensory processes with a short time constant (e.g., fast motor (re-)adaptation) requires accurate measurements immediately before and after entry, landing, or any other event that induces significant changes in the environment. Consequently, current methods of preflight training and post-flight rehabilitation have not been optimized to minimize the functional impacts of these natural adaptive responses during gravitational transitions or to restore environment-appropriate sensorimotor functions after these transitions. Current research suggests a multimodal representation of gravity58, in which proprioceptive, somatosensory, visual and vestibular signals are integrated for processing gravity-related cues. For instance, Mittelstaedt (1996) proposed a somatic component for graviception that is located in the trunk, and particularly in the kidneys59. Humans use an internal model to dissociate gravity and inertial acceleration from a composite acceleration signal49,60. As a result of the complex integration of graviception and its interaction with motor control, understanding how the nervous system adapts to changes in gravity is challenging. The precise nature and properties of this internal multimodal representation going beyond the vestibular system during acute gravitational transitions are also still to be determined. Experiments performed under altered gravitational levels have identified a rapid adaptation process. At the same time the data have also revealed biases indicative of partial habituation that could be observed throughout the entire (often short-term) exposure to weightlessness61–63. Early access to astronauts (immediately upon entry or after landing) is critical to characterize the dynamics of this highly dynamic adaptation process (see also previous section). This point has been emphasized in a previous white paper by White et al. (2016)3, and remains a critical issue. The next steps to deepen our understanding of the neural bases of adaptation to changes in gravity will require to address current methodological constraints such as technologies to measure brain function of cortical and sub-cortical structures in real-time. Furthermore, the modularity of dedicated discrete sensory organs and brain regions for processing gravity cues suggest a distributed role of structures and functions for perception and control50. In addition to visual, vestibular and internal (prior) information, somatosensory (proprioceptive) feedback and its influence on planning and control may serve as a calibration signal that is conditioning our perception and the scaling of motor commands. The importance of this sensory information has not been fully acknowledged so far. Finally, the experimental context itself faces several methodological challenges. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain cannot be used to acquire data during gravity transitions. Data collected before and after an interventions (e.g., parabolic flight or centrifugation) can probe neural adaptations in response to acute exposures to altered gravitational levels. Yet, they must be cautiously interpreted because they do not allow to draw any conclusions about the effects of gravity levels and transitions. Although there is solid evidence of the existence of a vestibular network that processes gravity signals50,64, current approaches are insufficient to draw clear-cut conclusions, firstly for methodological reasons, and secondly because gravity in essence influences all systems at the same time. Technologies to observe brain function such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are mobile and could potentially be used to capture cortical neurophysiological changes in response to altered gravity in real-time. EEG records electrocortical activity at the scalp surface with temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution (recent systems can support a density of 256 electrodes improving the accuracy of source localization techniques). In contrast, (f)NIRS reflects brain activation by measuring brain hemodynamic responses at lower temporal but higher spatial resolutions. Combining EEG and fNIRS may therefore overcome some of the previous methodological challenges and open new avenues to pinpoint how the brain creates an internal representation of gravity65,66. However, such approaches require cautious validation studies because of the potential confounding associated with cephalic fluid shifts on functional brain recordings67.Neurobehavioral countermeasures Given the variety of environmental and psychological stressors associated with prolonged exploratory class missions, a combination of different treatments and interventions will be needed to mitigate neurobehavioral risks, maximize performance, and ensure astronaut health and safety, and mission success. Considering that responses to different spaceflight stressors are expected to vary between astronauts and their phenotypic differences, the strategies for neurobehavioral risk mitigation need to be personalized in terms of type, frequency, and intensity throughout a space mission. We here summarize some of the current and future approaches to maintaining neurobehavioral health and performance. Artificial gravity—a holistic approach that could also benefit brain and behavior? Long-duration stay in microgravity on the various space stations demonstrated how gravity, or the lack thereof, has a significant impact on all organ systems such as bone decalcification, muscle loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, orthostatic intolerance, visual impairment, suppression of the immune system and other changes indicative of premature aging. Previous countermeasures to mitigate the effects of weightlessness have addressed different organ systems using target-specific approaches, i.e., lower body negative pressure68 and fluid loading to reduce orthostatic intolerance; resistive exercise and nutritional interventions to minimize muscle and bone loss; or aerobic exercise to maintain cardiorespiratory fitness69. Delivering Earth-like gravity levels using artificial gravity (AG) could provide a holistic approach by mitigating physiological risks associated with prolonged exposure to weightlessness across all organ systems70. The idea of using AG to compensate for the negative effects of weightlessness is as old as spaceflight itself and has been considered a standard against which other countermeasures should be measured71. A large, ground-based, rotating platform that could house human subjects for long periods (weeks to months) while exposing them 24/7 to higher-than-normal gravity levels would offer a unique means to validate the long-term beneficial effects of small hypergravity on the human body across all organ systems72. Whereas the idea of generating AG by means of rotating parts of a spacecraft is compelling, rotation can have a number of undesirable side effects on performance73. For example, consider the Orion spacecraft which is about 5 m in diameter. To generate a force of about 1 g in a circular space with a 2.5-m radius, a rotation rate of 20 rpm would be required to generate a force of about 1 g. Depending on the location relative to the center of rotation body weight (gravitational gradients) changes. Likewise, walking in the direction of rotation will increase the centripetal force, and hence AG, and therefore also increase body weight73. In addition, such rotation speeds create significant Coriolis forces generated by body movements. To systematically study such effects DiZio and Lackner established a unique rotating chamber at the Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory. This research resulted in a series of seminal studies on how lateral Coriolis forces can disrupt body movements and object transport and manipulation, how reaching errors carry-over in the opposite direction when the rotation stops, and that the human body can adapt to the Coriolis force and compensate the perturbations very rapidly73. However, data on the long-term benefits of prolonged use of rotating chambers on the human body are lacking. In addition, the design and technical implementation of AG using rotating chambers in spacecrafts remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to the continuous rotation of a spacecraft to mimic Earth’s gravity, an efficient comprise could be the use of a short-arm radius centrifuge74. Exposing crewmembers to AG of 1 to 2 g at the heart for 0.5 to 2 h has been shown to be a promising countermeasure for reducing the effects on body unloading and fluid shifts75. AG has been shown to mitigate cardiovascular deconditioning74,76–79; muscle and bone loss80–82; improve neuromotor reflex function83; decrease headache severity associated with head-down tilt bedrest84; and alleviate some of the conditions of the spaceflight associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS)75. AG also provides critical cues to the vestibular system. This is important because the vestibular system goes beyond maintaining gaze and postural stabilization. There is increasing evidence indicating that the vestibular system plays a critical role in brain plasticity and cognitive performance such as learning and memory formation33. For instance, patients with bilateral vestibular loss exhibited bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus of nearly 20%, which was correlated with spatial memory deficits in a virtual Morris water maze task85. The manipulation of the vestibular system has been shown to impair firing patterns of head direction cells (which are located in various brain areas including the subiculum, thalamus, and retrosplenial cortex86), hippocampal function, and medial entorhinal cortex87–89. Together these data highlight that vestibular stimulation provides critical cues for brain health and cognitive performance, supporting the notion that AG as a countermeasure could go beyond the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system and also benefit brain and behavioral health. In addition, recent cell experiments suggest that hypergravity can have profound beneficial effects on neuronal health that are independent of vestibular stimulation. For instance, Lichterfeld et al. (2022) recently showed that hypergravity attenuates astrocytic reactivity, which is critical to limiting severe astrogliosis and the formation of the glial scar90. Likewise, exposure of murine primary hippocampal neurons to 2 g hypergravity increased neurite number by 30% and neurite projection length by 20%. In addition, mature synaptic contacts were formed under hypergravity conditions in neurons of later developmental stages91. These data provide evidence that hypergravity ameliorates neuronal cell growth and synaptic plasticity in vivo. Whether the effects of hypergravity on the cellular level also translate to humans is unclear. Recent advances by space agencies are attempting to unravel the effects of AG on all organ systems including brain and behavior and to identify the most efficient protocols for using AG as a countermeasure. For instance, the NASA/ESA AGBRESA bed rest study carried out at DLR in 2019/2020 aimed to compare intermittent vs continuous AG exposures. Currently, ESA is carrying out two long-term bed rest studies investigating the effects of AG with different types of physical exercise. Specifically, the concept involves a hybrid approach of AG and physical exercise, i.e., exposing subjects to physical exercise while they are being centrifuged. Given the benefits of exercise across all organ systems, it is hypothesized that AG combined with physical exercise will interact in synergistically. With respect to the mitigation of neurobehavioral risks, it is noteworthy that physical exercise is also a potent stimulus for structural and functional brain plasticity92. Animal studies demonstrate that voluntary running increases synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus93. The causal link between physical activity and hippocampal plasticity and cognitive benefits such as spatial memory performance has also been reported in a number of human studies94–96. The selective effects of AG and exercise on the brain suggest that the integrative approach of AG combined with exercise could go beyond affecting the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system and also mitigate neurobehavioral risks associated with long-duration spaceflight in a highly efficient manner. While the hybrid approach of combining AG with physical exercise is promising it remains to be determined whether the benefits will go beyond exercise (or AG) per se and whether future crew vehicles will allow supporting the space and infrastructure of SAHC.Operational performance Future long-duration space expeditions will be among the most difficult, dangerous and complex operations in history. Astronauts will be required to stay physically and socially isolated in confined spaces for 30 months, and longer. It is expected that not all skills and knowledge required for these missions can be retained and retrieved based on pre-mission training alone. Limited and delayed communication will significantly constrain support from Mission Control and crews will increasingly rely on autonomous onboard technologies to successfully perform rendezvous maneuvers, and telerobotic operations post-landing. Augmented feedback and autonomous self-adaptative, just-in-time training of spaceflight-relevant tasks may help to maintain operational performance.Autonomous self-adaptative, just-in-time sensorimotor training Adaptive, just-in-time training relevant to these specific requirements could address this need by delivering tasks that adjust the difficulty level to the individual astronaut’s knowledge and skill learning curve. To mitigate this risk, research needs to identify the neural bases of key operational tasks, and design neuroscience-based adaptive visuomotor training programs that can be flexibly adapted to specific mission requirements and crew demands. These approaches should be characterized by (1) consolidating and improving sensorimotor skills relevant for inflight and post-landing operational tasks; (2) featuring an autonomous and adaptive training approach that does not rely on feedback from flight operations on ground; (3) maximizing the transfer of mission-relevant motor skills; (4) allowing the assessment of the neural circuitry underlying the task; and (5) delivering the training in a motivating and meaningful way to astronauts.Augmented feedback How can human motor skills for operating human-machine interfaces such as controlers be maintained when gravitational levels change? Can fine skills be supported by manipulating vestibular and visual cues and controlling somatosensory and haptic information? Does the use of 1g-dynamics at the human/machine interface during altered gravity promote skill acquistion? Or would such feedback even impair learning and adaptation processes due to conflicting sensory information? Addressing these questions is complex because graviception and the internal representation of gravity is an integrative multimodal process. The basic rationale for using augmented feedback to maintain operational performance is that the central nervous system masters the motor control of complex tasks in 1 g. Delivering controler dynamics mimicking 1 g levels and/or providing haptic feedback could be expected to speed up learning and maintaining operational tasks. A few studies tested whether the simulation of a local terrestrial gravity (1 g) applied at the level of the hand improves pointing performance during altered gravity (0 g and 1.8 g)97,98. The data of this work are promising, showing pointing performance improvements and supporting the idea to design human-machine interfaces leveraging haptic feedback98. The effects of a simulation of weightlessness (0 g) and hypergravity (1.8 g) on the same task parameters have also been investigated on ground (i.e., 1 g). Remarkably, the simulation of gravitational fields different from 1 g applied locally to the effector produced effects that were comparable to immersion in an altered gravitational field99. These data demonstrate that the application of simple focal forces is sufficient to reproduce the effects of gravitational changes on relevant task parameters. In other words, more complex systems that simulate distributed force fields on the body, e.g., the upper arm, are not necessary. Together, the results underline the importance of the proprioceptive signals for the encoding of gravity, and also call for future research to better understand these effects with potential applications in robotic rehabilitation. Finally, noise, like gravity, is also omnipresent in any environment and cannot be completed removed in the chain of physiological signal processing. Counter-intuitively, noise—or uncertainty in sensory signals—can be beneficial in some conditions. Stochastic resonance is a mechanism whereby a particular level of noise enhances the response of nonlinear systems to weak sensory signals. The effects of stochastic resonance on sensory modalities and, more particularly on somatosensory information have been demonstrated, paving the way toward its potential for improving sensorimotor performance as well as cognitive and autonomic functions100. These promising results demonstrate that stochastic resonance represents a flexible and non-invasive technique that can be applied to a variety of scenarios beyond astronauts, including in ambulant elderly, skilled movements, sports, and to patients with sensorimotor or autonomic dysfunctions101. Future research on the use of self-adaptive, automous operational training and augmented feedback will help to better understand the fundamentals of fine motor skill acquisition and adaptation, and provide insightful information on the optimal design and control of human-machine interfaces and wearable robots in space environments and other immersive dynamics.Individualized countermeasures The variety and specificity of neurobehavioral hazards and risks associated with spaceflight highlight the need for a combination of different approaches and methodologies to mitigate environmental and psychological stressors associated with prolonged space missions. These interventions comprise a range of methodologies, technologies, and approaches such as: self-adaptive training systems and augmented feedback to maintain operational performance; exercise and relaxation programs; schedules supporting sleep hygiene and maintaining regular work/rest cycles; engaging in meaningful work and learning; food, plant growth, VR sensory stimulation and entertainment; team building; family support; psychological counseling; balancing social and personal space; and habitat characteristics promoting health and well-being. Like personalized medicine, the administration of these measures should be based on the crewmembers’ individual needs instead of facilitating a single “one fits all” strategy applied to every crew member. Furthermore, the combination and prioritization of countermeasures should also be considered a dynamic process that varies within individuals and across time. In other words, the relative importance of specific strategies will vary during the course of a mission, requiring a constant reevaluation of the crewmembers’ individual needs. Stahn & Kühn (2021) referred to this concept as “Individualized Countermeasures” (ICount), which defines countermeasures as a dynamic construct that is optimized relative to the individual requirements as a function of mission duration. It requires the development of a systematic “toolbox” that combines a multiplicity of methodologies and approaches that can be flexibly utilized to meet crews’ individual needs102. The variety of approaches, the consideration of phenotypic differences, and the dynamic nature of individual preferences for specific needs during long-duration expeditions will be critical to maximize the benefits and synergies of neurobehavioral countermeasures.Priorities for the space program (microgravity and/or exploration relevance) An integrative framework from omics to behavior Future long-duration space missions will be considerably longer than current 6-month missions on ISS. Mitigating cognitive and behavioral risks during such missions is a high priority for successful mission completion requiring several strategies that are summarized in Box 1. First, to address this gap research should target an integrative approach combining state-of-the-art immunological, neuroendrinological, behavioral, and imaging technologies that go beyond current experiments on ISS and spaceflight analogs. Multi-model neuroimaging approaches, including functional imaging to identify differences in brain networks and their connectivities, high-resolution structural imaging allowing to segment tiny, but critical subcortical brain areas such as the hippocampus with precision, and techniques to examine the role of the cortical circuitry associated with critical mission tasks control will play an important role to fully understand brain changes in response to spaceflight. This approach needs to go beyond standard clinical brain imaging but use novel imaging techniques such as multi-parameter mapping and include task functional MRI sequences that have high operational relevance, i.e., comprise tasks that allow to quantify the neural signatures of operational tasks such as docking and rendezvous maneuvers. In addition to leveraging operational performance tasks, cognitive testing should go beyond classical standard paradigms and neuropsychological test batteries. Future work should consider innovative tasks using a hypothesis-driven approach that is specifically targeted at the astronaut population relative to task type, difficulty, and duration. To account for effects related to the pathways between the vestibular signal processing, the limbic system and cortex imaging and behavioral measures should be linked to data from postural and functional mobility tests, videonystagmography, and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Given the importance of mood, sleep and circadian rhythms on cognitive function, they need to be considered as potential moderators of neurobehavioral performance. Exploring the relationships between neurobehavioral data and ocular examinations such as visual acuity, intraocular pressure, retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, and peripapillary and macular retinal thicknesses will allow corroborating the role of any visual impairments in response to spaceflight on cognitive performance. Key neurotrophins, oxidative stress markers, and neuroprotective cytokines are critical for brain health and behavior and have been shown to be modulated by physical (in)activity and spaceflight stressors. Biochemical assessments and advances in multi-omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics can therefore help to close knowledge gaps of the underlying molecular mechanisms and genetic drivers of neurobehavioral adaptations. Understanding the effect of sex and other phenotypic differences on sensorimotor and neurobehavioral changes is imperative because women will play an increasingly important role in future space missions. The overall approach should leverage the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) heuristic framework to integrate various levels of information from omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), cells, and molecular signatures to integrative physiology, neuroimaging, cognitive tests, and self-report. Such an integrative framework will allow us to better understand the basic neurophysiological dimensions of functioning underlying the full range of human behavior from normal to abnormal that relate to individual and interpersonal adaptation and vulnerability during long-duration spaceflight, and promote the development of effective, target-specific, and individualized countermeasures (Fig. 1). This line of research will build on current gaps in the present knowledge of this topic by delivering novel and unique data on behavioral, sensorimotor, and operational performance outcomes, and their neural basis. To this aim, the knowledge, technologies, and tools derived from such data relevantly contribute to the space agencies’ goal to provide knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration. This will support mission planners and system developers with strategies for monitoring and mitigating crew health and performance threats that are currently unaddressed and considered high risks during future exploratory space missions. Together, the combination of various levels of knowledge, methodologies, and outcomes highlighted here could provide the basis to better understand and characterize the type, extent, cause, and mechanisms of neurobehavioral changes in response to spaceflight and their phenotypic signatures. The complexity, expertise, effort, and costs cannot be leveraged by a single experiment. However, the way spaceflight and spaceflight analog studies are typically conceptualized has already the potential to address such a framework. Space agencies solicit announcements of opportunities to propose specific experiments. Following peer-review, feasibility assessment, and a definition phase, a final protocol integrates several experiments that typically address a range of physiological and behavioral research questions, including but not limited to cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, vestibular, immunological, and neurobehavioral outcomes. It is intriguing that researchers and agencies could leverage the integrative nature of such platforms and projects. Such an approach goes beyond data use agreements between experiments but starts with the identification of deliverables using a hypothesis-driven rationale that promotes a holistic understanding of intellectual frameworks that together exceed the individual disciplinary perspectives.Box 1 Summary of key recommendations for mitigating operational performance deficits during exploration class missions. Promote an integrative research framework that allows to collect data across neural and behavioral dimensions that maximize the understanding of cognitive and operational performance Understand sex as a biological variable: include the number of female astronauts being studied Better understand the internal representation of gravity, and its role in maintaining visuo-spatial abilities during changing gravity conditions Investigate the effects of spaceflight on spatial cognition and its neural basis Establish brain imaging that goes beyond the identification of clinical manifestations, e.g., task functional MRI sequences that have high operational relevance and allow to quantify the neural basis of cognitive impairments, and predict future performance in navigation tasks, docking maneuvers, and other spaceflight-relevant behavioral measures. Develop cognitive tasks using a hypothesis-driven approach that are specifically targeted at the astronaut population and expected to be particularly vulnerable to spaceflight Enhance unobtrusive monitoring technologies to foster integrative data collection across neural and behavioral dimensions Consider artificial gravity and individualized countermeasures as cornerstones for mitigating human spaceflight risks Promote data sharing and collaboration at all levels between researchers and agencies to leverage and maximize integrative research approach across disciplines Data sharing and international collaboration To efficiently leverage such integrative approaches national and international collaborations between researchers and space agencies will be increasingly critical103. Overarching aspects linking to all scientific disciplines are clear. The inaccessibility of operational performance data to the scientific community complicates the study of the relationships between physiological changes and potential performance deficits (e.g., piloting performance, emergency egress, manual control, etc.) during critical mission phases. Protocols should be established for the disclosure of operational performance data to qualified researchers. Promoting closer partnerships among the scientific, operations, and training communities could be an efficient step to pave this way. Furthermore, the development of a data repository archiving past experimental data sets and information on their contexts could be very valuable to enhance the usability of previous data (e.g., challenge the low-N problem in space research).Benefit for earth and industrial relevance Understanding how the brain adapts to spaceflight and processes gravitational information to shape actions is a fundamental yet challenging question. Every step toward this ambitious objective will open new doors to unexplored arenas, all of which with the potential to bring innovation transferrable to terrestrial applications. Mobile miniaturized monitoring technologies developed for spaceflight could foster the unobtrusive collection of neurophysiological data to detect adverse neurobehavioral outcomes at an early stage, and potentially avoid clinical manifestations in response to environmental conditions, psychological stressors, and unhealthy life-styles. Spaceflight analogs provide unique settings that promote novel insights into brain and behavioral plasticity on Earth104. Bed rest or dry immersion can be considered models of aging. Likewise, isolation studies can serve as models of social distancing associated with pandemics. Changes that typically evolve over years can be mimicked in time-lapse, providing unique opportunities to explore aging-related diseases and their prevention. In addition, the high standardization and control of these studies (e.g., nutrition, sleep/wake cycles, and social activities) could promote the understanding of causal relationships between inactivity, brain function, and cognitive alterations. Collectively, these characteristics can translate the knowledge gained from these studies to the prevention and treatment of various clinical conditions associated with cognitive impairments, for which reduced physical activity levels are a critical risk factor such as chronic heart failure, Type II diabetes, obesity, myotonic dystrophy, fibromyalgia, various types of cancer, depression, anxiety, and dementia. In addition to better understanding such phenomena and their mechanisms spaceflight research can also boost innovative and efficient technologies for monitoring and predicting adverse neurobehavioral conditions, and promote the development of innovative treatment strategies105. Technologies such as augmented feedback and virtual reality—also in combination with physical exercise—can help patients to accelerate recovery or serve as a training tool for promoting brain health106. Given the fundamental role of gravity on the human body the use of artificial gravity may open new avenues for promoting health and disease. In addition to short bouts of artificial gravity induces by short-arm human centrifuges, large rotating habitats that can house subjects for days could serve to better understand the effects of artificial gravity on the human organism, and potentially probe new interventions for modern epidemic health issues such as obesity, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and cardiovascular deconditioning.Future outlook and summary As space-faring nations across the globe are fueling a new race of human space exploration that goes well beyond the Moon, national agencies and private entities across the globe have accelerated the research and development that will promote the safety and success of such missions. These missions will be some of the most difficult, dangerous, and dynamic operations in history, and considerably longer than current standard missions on ISS. Under current and notional NASA plans, crewed orbital missions to Mars could exceed 1,000 days, and exploration campaigns could even span decades. Such prolonged mission durations could introduce potential unprecedented astronauts’ health and performance risks. Adverse behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders are considered one of the most serious but also least understood risks during such long-duration space missions. The effects of extreme environmental conditions and psychological stressors on brain and behavior are currently not fully understood. Future work in this field should be characterized by an interdisciplinary approach that promotes collaborations across space agencies, considers sex as a biological variable, and integrates multimodal brain imaging, psychological and behavioral, neurovestibular, cardiovascular, omics, sleep, and circadian data. Such an approach could promote a holistic understanding of intellectual frameworks that together exceed individual disciplinary perspectives. The knowledge from such approaches could go beyond their application to spaceflight and translate to the prevention and treatment of various clinical conditions on Earth including but not limited to neurogenerative diseases.Acknowledgements This research was supported by the European Space Agency (ESA).Author contributions All authors were part of an ESA working group to identify the challenges for neurosciences research in future space exploration.

    "abstract": "Abstract Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Plants undergo substantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgrave et al., 1997; Wolff et al., 2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Link et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2001, 2005, 2012b, 2013; Stutte et al., 2006; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Salmi et al., 2011; Correll et al., 2013; Nasir et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014). However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazars et al., 2014). The distribution of differentially abundant proteins among three treatments (microgravity of the ISS, a 1g orbital centrifuge, and a 1g ground control) highlights familiar pathways in gravity signal transduction. Many of the membrane-associated proteins involved in auxin signaling cascades were less prominent in microgravity-grown plants, while many proteins typically associated with stress responses were more abundant. While there is not a one-to-one correlation with any gene set from a published spaceflight transcriptome, similar trends in the differential expression of genes important to auxin metabolism, and to a variety of stress responses, can be seen in the transcription profiles from several studies (see citations above). A proteomic survey in terrestrial altered-gravity environments also revealed a host of general stress proteins as well as those associated with auxin signaling (Tan et al., 2011). Although there is little specific overlap with transcriptome studies of plants exposed to similar environments, many of the trends in pathways affected by spaceflight are similar among the studies (Moseyko et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2011). With increased technical sensitivity and better access to space, the spaceflight responses contribute to a comprehensive picture of the strategies used by plants to cope with changes in their environment. Comparative proteomics mass spectrometry (MS) methods can be used to reveal quantitative changes in the protein complement of cells and organs over a large scale between and among samples. The use of iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification; Applied Biosystems) allows for quantitative comparisons of samples by labeling lysine residues and N-termini of peptides with mass reporter molecules, such that the samples can be combined into simultaneous analyses by MS. The relative amounts of every identified peptide from each sample are simultaneously revealed within the tandem mass spectra through the relative intensity of the differentially labeled ion peaks, enabling each peptide to be correlated to each sample through the mass of the reporter molecules. Several papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of iTRAQ analysis of Arabidopsis samples in the study of broad-scale proteomic changes (Zhao et al., 2010; Alvarez et al., 2011; Schenck et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). The major scientific goal of this study was to discover proteomics changes that characterize the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment. To accomplish this goal, we sought to examine proteomics changes on an organ-specific level by comparing the proteomics of roots and leaves between plants grown in space and plants grown on Earth. The samples were from Arabidopsis seedlings from three green fluorescent protein (GFP) lines that were germinated on the ISS and grown for 12 days before being preserved in the strong protein denaturant RNAlater and then frozen. The nature of these samples, having been preserved in RNAlater primarily for gene expression analyses, necessitated the development of methods for protein extraction from RNAlater samples and the processing of small amounts of proteins through iTRAQ and MS analyses. Therefore, the secondary and technical goal of this study was to examine proteomics based on samples from this preservation method, which is widely used in ISS spaceflight biology research, to discern whether this form of preservation could enable broad-scale proteomics of spaceflight samples. The resulting data demonstrate the technical success of the approach and show significant spaceflight-induced proteomic changes that were different between roots and leaves. These proteomics data are discussed in the context of adaptive physiologies in space and are also discussed in relation to gene expression changes that have been seen in similar plants in space.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant growth and harvest on the ISS The data presented here are from plants harvested during one of several experiments launched to the ISS on STS-129, November 16, 2009 (specifically, Run 1B: 12/3/2009–12/15/2009), and returned on STS-130, February 8, 2010. Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates (Paul et al., 2004). The samples come from a collection of three Arabidopsis lines. The three GFP [green fluorescent protein (Sheen et al., 1995)] reporter gene lines were Adh::GFP [alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (Manak et al., 2002)]; DR5r::GFP [synthetic auxin response element composed of five AuxRE elements; gift of T. Guilfoyle (Ulmasov et al., 1997)]; and 35s::GFP [driven by the CaMV35s promoter (Manak et al., 2002)]. Seeds and seeded plates were prepared in such a way as to maintain dormancy in light-tight coverings until the initiation of the experiment on orbit (Paul et al., 2012a). The plated seeds remained dormant until activated by exposure to light on the ISS, which initiated germination. Both the flight plates and ground control plates were grown in the Advanced Biological Research System, ABRS (NASA, 2011a; Paul et al., 2012a, 2013). The ABRS provided temperature control, light control, and circulation of air that was scrubbed to remove volatile organic compounds. On orbit, the dormant seeded plates were unwrapped from their coverings and installed in the GFP Imaging System (GIS) (Fig. 1A), which was then inserted into the ABRS. The GIS held the plates within the ABRS, facilitated access by the astronaut on orbit, and provided regular imaging (NASA, 2011b; Paul et al., 2012a). After growth, all plates were photographed by the crew (Fig. 1B), along with the comparable GIS/ABRS-grown ground control (Fig. 1C). The plates were then harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) (Fig. 1D and 1E) and then stowed below −80°C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS (Ferl et al., 2011) before return. The ground control plates were similarly housed in the GIS of an ABRS in the Orbital Environmental Simulator chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center following a similar, but delayed, timeline as the plates on the ISS, with the use of environmental data such as temperature, relative humidity, light levels, and CO2 concentrations as was experienced by the plants on orbit. Further details on the operational outlines can be found in Paul et al. (2012a, 2013). The ground control samples received the same physical processing steps of harvest, freezing, thawing, and distribution in the laboratory as did the spaceflight samples. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Plant growth, hardware, harvesting, and preservation in RNAlater on the ISS. The Petri plates within which the plants were grown were housed in the GIS unit of the ABRS (A). A representative flight (B) and ground control (C) plate are shown, along with astronaut Jeff Williams harvesting plates on the ISS (D) for preservation in RNAlater in a KFT (E) before freezing on orbit. (Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast) 2.2. Isolation of proteins from RNAlater-preserved Arabidopsis The 12-day-old plants recovered from the frozen KFTs of both flight and ground control plants were thawed then dissected into roots, hypocotyls, and leaves, similar to the dissections performed by Paul et al. (2013). Approximately half the root material from 6–7 seedlings within a single Petri plate constituted each of three biological replicates for analysis of root proteins. For each replicate, 80 mg of RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis root material was blotted with tissue to remove excess RNAlater and then ground in a liquid nitrogen–chilled pestle and mortar with 400 μL protein extraction buffer per sample [100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol], commercial cocktails of protease (Set VI, Calbiochem) and phosphatase (Set I, Calbiochem) inhibitors. Samples were ground until completely homogeneous and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing buffer-soluble proteins was collected, and proteins were purified as described by Koh et al. (2012). The leaf sample from flight and ground control plants was similarly prepared from half the material of a single Petri plate, constituting the leaves from seven plants. Protein assays were performed to quantify purified proteins by using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with the SoftMax Pro Software v5.3 (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA, USA) under the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices). 2.3. Protein digestion, iTRAQ labeling, and MS For each sample (three replicate root samples and the single leaf sample for the flight and ground controls), 16 μg of the recovered proteins were reduced, alkylated, trypsin-digested, and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions (AB Sciex Inc.). The three biological replicates of ground root samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags 113, 114, and 115, and those of flight root samples were labeled with 116, 117, and 118, respectively. The ground shoot sample was labeled with iTRAQ tag 119, while the flight shoot was labeled with 121. The combined labeled peptide mixtures were desalted with C18-solid phase extraction and dissolved in strong cation exchange solvent A [25% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (pH 2.8)]. The peptides were fractionated by an Agilent HPLC system 1260 with a polysulfoethyl A column (2.1×100 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å; PolyLC, Columbia, MD, USA) with a flow rate of 200 μL/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–20% solvent B [25% (v/v) acetonitrile and 500 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.8)] over 50 min followed by ramping up to 100% solvent B in 5 min. Fourteen fractions were collected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm and lyophilized (Supplementary Fig. S1; supplementary data are available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast). A quadrupole-time-of-flight LTQ Orbitrap XL MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for data acquisition as described previously (Makarov et al., 2006). It was interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC AS2 system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA, USA) using high-energy collision dissociation. Each fraction was loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (0.3 mm i.d.×5 mm length, 5 μm particle size) with a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 10 min. Reversed-phase C18 chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out on a pre-packed BetaBasic C18 PicoFrit column (75 μm i.d.×10 cm length, New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) at 300 nL/min with the following gradient: 5% B for 1 min as an equilibration status; 60% B for 99 min as a gradient; 90% B for 5 min as a washing status; 5% B for 10 min as an equilibration status (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in 97% water, 3% acetonitrile; solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in 97% acetonitrile, 3% water). 2.4. Proteomics analyses The MS/MS data were processed by a thorough search considering biological modification and amino acid substitution against the non-redundant uniprot Arabidopsis thaliana database (53,270 entries downloaded on June 14, 2014, at http://beta.uniprot.org) by using the Fraglet and Taglet searches under the Paragon algorithm (Shilov et al., 2007) of ProteinPilot v.4.5 software (AB Sciex, Inc.) and Sequest search (Eng et al., 1994) under Proteome Discoverer v.1.4 software (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). Mascot searches (Perkins et al., 1999) under Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) were conducted with the following parameters: trypsin digestion allowing for up to two missed cleavages, methionine oxidation and iTRAQ on N-termini and lysines, iTRAQ 8-plex quantification, 10 ppm tolerance for MS and MS/MS, peptide charges of +1, +2, and +3, and monoisotopic masses. Plant protein, cysteine modification with methyl methanethiosulfate, fixed iTRAQ modification of free amine in the N-terminus and lysine, and variable iTRAQ modifications of tyrosine were considered. ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to cluster peptides to proteins (protein groups) and output lists of proteins having a minimum peptide probability of >0.95 and a minimum protein probability of <0.95 from all search results for final identification at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR; for comparison of FDRs, see Supplementary Fig. S2) (Tang et al., 2008). Systematic bias was corrected from non-redundant spectrum per peptide from all three search algorithms by using intensity normalization of protein quantification across samples by ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft). Protein relative quantification was performed by using the ratios from tandem mass spectra when the peptides were uniquely assigned to detected protein. To be identified as being significantly differentially expressed, a protein had to be quantified with at least three peptides in experimental replicates, a p value <0.05, and a fold change >1.2 or <0.8 as determined with a Fisher's combined probability of <0.05 (Fisher, 1948). For identified proteins, the functional annotation was assigned to identified protein sequences by Blast2GO suite (Conesa et al., 2005) (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome) and confirmed with the Arabidopsis functional catalog (Bevan et al., 1998). In addition, we used parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) of the agriGO tool (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO) to determine specifically enriched biological processes. The proteomics data are available for public access at the PRIDE Archive–proteomics data repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive). The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcaino et al., 2014) with the data-set identifier PXD001179 and DOI 10.6019/PXD001179. 2.5. Comparison of proteomic data with microarray data The proteomics data were compared with a previous gene expression study (Paul et al., 2013), which involved plants from the same experiment series on the ISS. In this comparison, we included 480 genes determined to be differentially expressed at the transcript level from that study and 546 differentially expressed proteins from this study. Among them, 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels for those commonly differentially expressed genes, correlation tests for which Pearson's r and Spearman's rho (rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of those 34 genes using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. Those genes or proteins not differentially expressed at both the protein and transcript levels were not included in the correlation analysis. 2.6. Network analysis The differentially abundant proteins were examined for cell wall associations by using SUBA3 searches (Tanz et al., 2013). The proteins returned with cell wall associations from SUBA3 were analyzed for interaction networking with GeneMANIA (Warde-Farley et al., 2010) with the Co-localization, Physical interactions, and Shared protein domains options, and Gene Ontology–based weighting.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Protein recovery and identification in spaceflight material RNAlater is widely used as an RNA preservative, primarily because it is a strong protein denaturant. Proteins can be recovered from RNAlater-preserved materials (van Eijsden et al., 2013), but because the tissues and proteins are denatured, the biological properties of the subcellular components or proteins were not used to pre-separate proteins into classes such as soluble, cytoplasmic, membrane, or cell wall proteins. Therefore, the proteins identified in this study are simply considered soluble proteins according to the protocol used for their extraction. Sufficient protein was recovered from each sample to proceed with iTRAQ methods. Over 1500 proteins were identified in the root and leaf samples at a global FDR of 5% against the decoy database, and over 1300 proteins in each sample at an FDR of 1% (see Supplementary Fig. S2). An FDR of 5% was chosen as the cutoff for further analysis of proteins in this study. Of the 1570 proteins identified in the samples at 5% FDR, 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins were identified with three or more protein-unique peptides, thus allowing them to be accurately quantified across the various flight and ground control samples (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab The number of proteins in the leaf and root samples meeting all the criteria for quantitation by iTRAQ. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast) 3.2. Differential protein abundance in spaceflight A Fisher's test of combined probabilities was used to determine differences in quantitation values for each protein identified with three or more unique peptides. The Fisher's test accounted for the number of peptides identified in each sample, together with the biological replicates of the root samples, to produce a p value for comparison of spaceflight versus ground controls for leaves and roots. Volcano plots of the p values and differential abundance as fold change of the root and leaf samples are presented in Fig. 3. Currently, an iTRAQ method underestimates fold changes, implying small changes may indicate significant differences between samples (Bantscheff et al., 2008; DeSouza et al., 2009; Karp et al., 2010); thus, most iTRAQ studies use fold changes of <0.8 or >1.2. Therefore, proteins were considered differentially abundant with p values greater than the threshold value (α=0.05) and fold-change values in excess of 0.8 and 1.2. Figure 4 shows Venn diagrams of the number of proteins differing in abundance between spaceflight and ground control samples. Of the 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins that were able to be accurately quantified, 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins met the criteria of statistical significance by p value and differential abundance by fold change in the spaceflight samples. Only 41 of the significant differentially abundant proteins were shared between roots and leaves (Fig. 4). FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Volcano plots of differential expression between spaceflight and ground tissues. Negative log10 p values were plotted on the y axis with log2 normalized fold change expression levels on the x axis. Significant differential expression with p value threshold values α=0.05 were present in areas exceeding the 0.8 and 1.2 of fold change threshold values. Red and green dots indicate up- and down-regulated protein in flight tissues relative to ground tissues.

Open in a new tab Summary of the differential protein accumulation in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Overall, 358 root and 256 shoot proteins were differentially represented in the spaceflight sample. When parsed by whether the protein was increased or decreased in spaceflight, 237 root proteins and 200 shoot proteins were up-regulated and accumulated to more abundance in spaceflight, while 121 root proteins and 56 shoot proteins were down-regulated in spaceflight. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast)In roots, 237 proteins were up-regulated in spaceflight, with an increase in abundance in the spaceflight samples meeting the significance criteria. In those same root samples, 121 proteins were found to be down-regulated and less abundant in spaceflight. For leaves, 200 proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, while 56 were less abundant. Again, few of these differentially regulated proteins were shared between the root and leaf samples. Only 47 proteins were similarly differentially abundant in both roots and leaves in spaceflight, being similarly increased or decreased in both tissues (Fig. 5). There were 21 proteins that were shared between roots and leaves but increased in one tissue and decreased in the other. A summary Venn diagram and table is presented at the bottom of Fig. 4. FIG. 5.

Table 1 is available in color online at www.liebertonline.com/ast. 3.3. Functional analysis of proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight When the proteomic changes were highlighted in global metabolic pathways (http://pmn.plantcyc.org/overviewsWeb/celOv.shtml?orgid=ARA), the effects of spaceflight were obviously different between leaf and root tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3 and also referring elements of Table 1). In addition, PAGE showed quite distinct patterns between leaves and roots when comparing the differential abundance based on the functional classification of the proteins (Table 2). For example, responses to light stimulus and response to radiation were similar, as were pathways involving cell wall metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table 2). Interestingly, in leaves, categories of proteins related to several biological pathways were up-regulated, including stress and defense responses, photosynthesis, translation, gene expression, and cellular component biogenesis, while categories of proteins involved in the functional generation of precursor metabolites and energy, localization, and transport were repressed. In addition, categories of proteins related to specific molecular functions, such as carbohydrate binding, structural constituent of ribosome, and isomerase activity, were up-regulated in response to spaceflight in leaves. However, categories associated with cell structure exhibited abundance in leaves and scarcity in roots. In roots, protein categories associated with several biological processes, such as cofactor metabolism, oxidative stress responses, and cellular lipid metabolism, showed increased abundance. The abundance of protein categories associated with basic molecular functions, such as ATP binding, adenyl ribonucleotide binding, adenyl nucleotide binding, purine nucleoside binding, and nucleoside binding, were also enhanced in roots.

Comparison of proteomic and gene expression data The proteomics data presented here were derived from Arabidopsis grown in Run 1B of the TAGES series of plant growth experiments. Gene expression from microarray data are available from Run 3A of the TAGES experiments (Paul et al., 2013), which involved similar-aged plants grown under very similar conditions on the ISS. The 546 differentially expressed proteins of the present study were compared to the 480 genes exhibiting differential transcript levels in the previous study. The genes encoding most of the proteins quantified in this study did not show a differential mRNA expression, and many of the proteins for genes differentially regulated at the mRNA level were not identified in this proteomics survey. A total of 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. Their transcript and protein fold-change values are compared in Fig. 5. Among the genes and proteins that do show differential expression, there is a positive correlation between direction and degree of differential expression (r=0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; rs=0.5087163, p value=0.0001618). To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels, correlation tests for which Pearson's r and Spearman's rho (rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of 34 genes by using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. As shown in Fig. 5, there is a positive correlation in direction and degree of differential expression between transcript and protein expression (r=0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; rs=0.5087163, p value=0.0001618). 3.5. Cell wall metabolism interaction network An interaction network was constructed to investigate potential functional relationships among the spaceflight differential proteins that are potentially involved in cell wall interactions and metabolisms. Figure 6 shows the results of the interaction analysis with several key collections of proteins highlighted. Physical interactions, shared protein domains, and co-localizations draw nearly all the cell wall–identified proteins of this study into a codified network that links cell wall carbohydrate enzymology with cell-cell interactions and signaling. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Interaction network of cell wall–related proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion The technical goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using RNAlater-preserved plant tissue, harvested and frozen on orbit, for broad-scale proteomics analysis of Arabidopsis spaceflight responses. RNAlater preservation of Arabidopsis within KFTs on orbit is commonly practiced, and a facile process pathway exists for harvesting to RNAlater and frozen sample return from the ISS. RNAlater-preserved plant materials from the ISS have been extensively used for gene expression analyses; however, to date, the use of RNAlater-preserved ISS material for proteomics has been limited to yeast (van Eijsden et al., 2013). The ability to conduct proteomics analyses on the same samples or on parallel samples returning from this established process pathway would advance the analysis potential for understanding Arabidopsis responses to spaceflight. This study demonstrated that sufficient protein amounts can be isolated from ISS samples preserved in RNAlater to allow broad-scale proteomics studies. Basically, enough protein was recovered from roots and leaves of 12-day-old plants from half a 10 cm2 Petri plate to conduct proteomic analyses rich enough to return the identities of 1570 proteins and to conduct quantitation on 1432 proteins with iTRAQ methods and relying on at least three unique peptides per protein. Moreover, the methods are sufficiently robust that true biological replicates are consistent and can support statistical methods for evaluation of quantitative differences among sample treatments. These RNAlater iTRAQ methods join frozen native sample recovery and non-isotopic methods (Mazars et al., 2014) as methods that have had successful initial application to space proteomics analyses of plants. It is very likely that the rapid advances in MS currently occurring will raise the number of proteins that can be quantitated in similar future studies that use this or any other sample recovery strategy. And as orbital preservation methods mature and are more broadly applied, informative comparative analyses among various species, growth conditions, and experiment protocols on orbit will become increasingly effective. The proteomic data from this study of three combined Arabidopsis lines support the general notion that plants engage specific metabolic responses to accomplish physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but that response is different among organs (Paul et al., 2013). The primary data supporting this conclusion are shown in Figs. 2 and 4. Of 885 proteins commonly quantified in roots and leaves, only 47 were similarly regulated in the spaceflight leaf and root samples. In contrast, 290 and 288 proteins in roots and leaves were uniquely differentially regulated by spaceflight in either one organ or the other. Moreover, pathway and process analysis of these differentially accumulated proteins indicates that roots and leaves are altering different pathways in response to spaceflight. There appears, broadly speaking, to be no single response at the proteomic level that is employed by all tissues of the plant in order to adapt to spaceflight. There are, however, a few common threads among the data sets. These data complement results of Mazars et al. (2014), who used a non-isotopic proteomics approach to examine spaceflight microgravity effects on membrane proteins of whole Arabidopsis seedlings. Their study used seedlings that were grown within chambers in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 12 days on the ISS, with the entire chambers frozen on orbit to allow recovery of frozen seedlings after return to Earth. Microsomal fractions were prepared from the whole seedlings and subjected to a label-free MS analysis. Thus, their analysis used different tissues, different preservation on orbit, different sample preparation that focused on microsomes, and different MS methods. Mazars and colleagues found that 69 microsomal proteins were specifically more abundant in microgravity (compared to ground and 1g controls), while 80 microsomal proteins were less abundant in microgravity. By using strictly TAIR AGI accession number as the link between their data and the data presented here, there are 23 proteins identified in common between the two studies. More generally, Mazars et al. (2014) concluded that proteins involved in signaling, trafficking, auxin metabolism, stress, and cell wall metabolism are influenced by microgravity, a conclusion that is supported and extended by the study presented here, with auxin signaling and cell wall remodeling being similarly identified here as altered by spaceflight. Many of the proteins identified here as differentially abundant in spaceflight are associated with auxin metabolism, and a large number are associated with cell wall modification that makes sense in light of the morphologies demonstrated by spaceflight roots (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2013; Nakashima et al., 2014). Of the differentially represented proteins presented in Table 1, 95 are associated with cell walls or cell wall metabolism either by Gene Ontology annotation or by reference when using SUBA3 searches (Tanz et al., 2013). The interaction network in Fig. 6 shows that most of these cell wall–associated proteins can be considered within a framework of functionally interactive proteins engaged in cell wall activities. There are many enzymes, such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, involved in cell wall carbohydrate modification, deconstruction, and remodeling present in the heart of the network (dark gray highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Gilbert 2010). The well-represented FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans (medium gray highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Seifert et al., 2014) and a SKU5-like protein are involved in cell shape and cell-cell interactions. For instance, SKU5-similar proteins encode an extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein involved in directional root growth in expanding cells. Mutants in this gene phenocopy the growth patterns seen on orbit in that they over-skew to the left (Sedbrook et al., 2002). FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans have been shown to positively modulate ABA-regulated root growth patterns in plants exposed to abiotic stress, and it is postulated that they function by interacting with mediators of ABA in a plasma membrane subdomain (Seifert et al., 2014). Fasciclins are typically associated with the outer face of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane via their GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor (Johnson et al., 2003; Demir et al., 2013). Two cell wall–associated lipid transfer proteins are also differentially represented in the differential spaceflight proteome (light gray highlight in Fig. 6). There is strong representation of cell wall peroxidases (green highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Bellincampi et al., 2014) and cell wall lectins (brown highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Kauss and Glaser 1974; Albenne et al., 2009) in the network, connecting key metabolism, stress response, and cell expansion activities in the network of proteins differentially regulated by spaceflight. There are also a number of proteins that are connected by a domain of unknown function (DUF) deeply involved in cell wall metabolism (lower left in Fig. 6) (e.g., Garza-Caligaris et al., 2012; Vazquez-Lobo et al., 2012). These proteomics studies offered an initial opportunity to potentially integrate information on spaceflight responses at the protein and mRNA levels in that these samples were derived from very similar grow-outs on the ISS to the transcriptomics studies of Paul et al. (2013). A direct comparison of differential protein levels and their corresponding transcript expression levels does show some correlation. However, only a small portion of the differential transcripts are represented in the differential protein levels, and vice versa. This is, however, in agreement with previous studies in yeast (Futcher et al., 1999; Gygi et al., 1999; Washburn et al., 2003), mice (Tian et al., 2004), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Nie et al., 2006), E. coli (Ishihama et al., 2005), Tragopogon (Koh et al., 2012), and cotton (Hu et al., 2013), showing that transcript abundances only partially predict protein abundances and that a series of regulatory processes involved in translation, localization, modification, and protein degradation play a substantial role in controlling protein expression (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). Nonetheless, conclusions based on the proteomics and transcriptomics levels closely interrelate when examining protein name or function as opposed to strict TAIR accession number. The exact same gene/protein may not be represented in the corresponding transcriptome, yet the differential proteome from these samples displays a similar engagement of cell wall remodeling tools in response to spaceflight as seen in the transcriptome from similar samples. Roots and leaves adapt differently to spaceflight at the level of proteomics. While there are some commonalities among the spaceflight proteome changes in roots and leaves, such as cell wall metabolism, the present data indicate that roots and leaves invoke differential proteome responses to spaceflight. This is consistent with transcriptome data that also indicate differential spaceflight responses in leaves and roots (Paul et al., 2013). It is likely that, as proteomics technologies as well as gene expression and other omics technologies achieve increased density of coverage and finer spatial resolution, it will be revealed that different cell types within organs respond differently to spaceflight. And as increased numbers of biological experiments are enabled on the ISS, it is likely that multiple approaches will combine to yield both cell-specific response pathways as well as more general principles involved in plant spaceflight adaptation.

Copyright notice ID: 4290804 PMID: 25517942 Abstract Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach. Key Words: Space biology—Proteomics—Gene expression—ISS. Astrobiology 15, 32–56.1. Introduction Plants undergo substantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgrave et al., 1997; Wolff et al., 2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Link et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2001, 2005, 2012b, 2013; Stutte et al., 2006; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Salmi et al., 2011; Correll et al., 2013; Nasir et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014). However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazars et al., 2014). The distribution of differentially abundant proteins among three treatments (microgravity of the ISS, a 1g orbital centrifuge, and a 1g ground control) highlights familiar pathways in gravity signal transduction. Many of the membrane-associated proteins involved in auxin signaling cascades were less prominent in microgravity-grown plants, while many proteins typically associated with stress responses were more abundant. While there is not a one-to-one correlation with any gene set from a published spaceflight transcriptome, similar trends in the differential expression of genes important to auxin metabolism, and to a variety of stress responses, can be seen in the transcription profiles from several studies (see citations above). A proteomic survey in terrestrial altered-gravity environments also revealed a host of general stress proteins as well as those associated with auxin signaling (Tan et al., 2011). Although there is little specific overlap with transcriptome studies of plants exposed to similar environments, many of the trends in pathways affected by spaceflight are similar among the studies (Moseyko et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2011). With increased technical sensitivity and better access to space, the spaceflight responses contribute to a comprehensive picture of the strategies used by plants to cope with changes in their environment. Comparative proteomics mass spectrometry (MS) methods can be used to reveal quantitative changes in the protein complement of cells and organs over a large scale between and among samples. The use of iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification; Applied Biosystems) allows for quantitative comparisons of samples by labeling lysine residues and N-termini of peptides with mass reporter molecules, such that the samples can be combined into simultaneous analyses by MS. The relative amounts of every identified peptide from each sample are simultaneously revealed within the tandem mass spectra through the relative intensity of the differentially labeled ion peaks, enabling each peptide to be correlated to each sample through the mass of the reporter molecules. Several papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of iTRAQ analysis of Arabidopsis samples in the study of broad-scale proteomic changes (Zhao et al., 2010; Alvarez et al., 2011; Schenck et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). The major scientific goal of this study was to discover proteomics changes that characterize the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment. To accomplish this goal, we sought to examine proteomics changes on an organ-specific level by comparing the proteomics of roots and leaves between plants grown in space and plants grown on Earth. The samples were from Arabidopsis seedlings from three green fluorescent protein (GFP) lines that were germinated on the ISS and grown for 12 days before being preserved in the strong protein denaturant RNAlater and then frozen. The nature of these samples, having been preserved in RNAlater primarily for gene expression analyses, necessitated the development of methods for protein extraction from RNAlater samples and the processing of small amounts of proteins through iTRAQ and MS analyses. Therefore, the secondary and technical goal of this study was to examine proteomics based on samples from this preservation method, which is widely used in ISS spaceflight biology research, to discern whether this form of preservation could enable broad-scale proteomics of spaceflight samples. The resulting data demonstrate the technical success of the approach and show significant spaceflight-induced proteomic changes that were different between roots and leaves. These proteomics data are discussed in the context of adaptive physiologies in space and are also discussed in relation to gene expression changes that have been seen in similar plants in space.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant growth and harvest on the ISS The data presented here are from plants harvested during one of several experiments launched to the ISS on STS-129, November 16, 2009 (specifically, Run 1B: 12/3/2009–12/15/2009), and returned on STS-130, February 8, 2010. Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2 solid media plates (Paul et al., 2004). The samples come from a collection of three Arabidopsis lines. The three GFP [green fluorescent protein (Sheen et al., 1995)] reporter gene lines were Adh::GFP [alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (Manak et al., 2002)]; DR5r::GFP [synthetic auxin response element composed of five AuxRE elements; gift of T. Guilfoyle (Ulmasov et al., 1997)]; and 35s::GFP [driven by the CaMV35s promoter (Manak et al., 2002)]. Seeds and seeded plates were prepared in such a way as to maintain dormancy in light-tight coverings until the initiation of the experiment on orbit (Paul et al., 2012a). The plated seeds remained dormant until activated by exposure to light on the ISS, which initiated germination. Both the flight plates and ground control plates were grown in the Advanced Biological Research System, ABRS (NASA, 2011a; Paul et al., 2012a, 2013). The ABRS provided temperature control, light control, and circulation of air that was scrubbed to remove volatile organic compounds. On orbit, the dormant seeded plates were unwrapped from their coverings and installed in the GFP Imaging System (GIS) (Fig. 1A), which was then inserted into the ABRS. The GIS held the plates within the ABRS, facilitated access by the astronaut on orbit, and provided regular imaging (NASA, 2011b; Paul et al., 2012a). After growth, all plates were photographed by the crew (Fig. 1B), along with the comparable GIS/ABRS-grown ground control (Fig. 1C). The plates were then harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) (Fig. 1D and 1E) and then stowed below −80°C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS (Ferl et al., 2011) before return. The ground control plates were similarly housed in the GIS of an ABRS in the Orbital Environmental Simulator chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center following a similar, but delayed, timeline as the plates on the ISS, with the use of environmental data such as temperature, relative humidity, light levels, and CO2 concentrations as was experienced by the plants on orbit. Further details on the operational outlines can be found in Paul et al. (2012a, 2013). The ground control samples received the same physical processing steps of harvest, freezing, thawing, and distribution in the laboratory as did the spaceflight samples. FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Plant growth, hardware, harvesting, and preservation in RNAlater on the ISS. The Petri plates within which the plants were grown were housed in the GIS unit of the ABRS (A). A representative flight (B) and ground control (C) plate are shown, along with astronaut Jeff Williams harvesting plates on the ISS (D) for preservation in RNAlater in a KFT (E) before freezing on orbit. (Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast)2.2. Isolation of proteins from RNAlater-preserved Arabidopsis The 12-day-old plants recovered from the frozen KFTs of both flight and ground control plants were thawed then dissected into roots, hypocotyls, and leaves, similar to the dissections performed by Paul et al. (2013). Approximately half the root material from 6–7 seedlings within a single Petri plate constituted each of three biological replicates for analysis of root proteins. For each replicate, 80 mg of RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis root material was blotted with tissue to remove excess RNAlater and then ground in a liquid nitrogen–chilled pestle and mortar with 400 μL protein extraction buffer per sample [100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol], commercial cocktails of protease (Set VI, Calbiochem) and phosphatase (Set I, Calbiochem) inhibitors. Samples were ground until completely homogeneous and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing buffer-soluble proteins was collected, and proteins were purified as described by Koh et al. (2012). The leaf sample from flight and ground control plants was similarly prepared from half the material of a single Petri plate, constituting the leaves from seven plants. Protein assays were performed to quantify purified proteins by using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with the SoftMax Pro Software v5.3 (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA, USA) under the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices).2.3. Protein digestion, iTRAQ labeling, and MS For each sample (three replicate root samples and the single leaf sample for the flight and ground controls), 16 μg of the recovered proteins were reduced, alkylated, trypsin-digested, and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions (AB Sciex Inc.). The three biological replicates of ground root samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags 113, 114, and 115, and those of flight root samples were labeled with 116, 117, and 118, respectively. The ground shoot sample was labeled with iTRAQ tag 119, while the flight shoot was labeled with 121. The combined labeled peptide mixtures were desalted with C18-solid phase extraction and dissolved in strong cation exchange solvent A [25% (v/v) acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (pH 2.8)]. The peptides were fractionated by an Agilent HPLC system 1260 with a polysulfoethyl A column (2.1×100 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å; PolyLC, Columbia, MD, USA) with a flow rate of 200 μL/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–20% solvent B [25% (v/v) acetonitrile and 500 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.8)] over 50 min followed by ramping up to 100% solvent B in 5 min. Fourteen fractions were collected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm and lyophilized (Supplementary Fig. S1; supplementary data are available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast). A quadrupole-time-of-flight LTQ Orbitrap XL MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for data acquisition as described previously (Makarov et al., 2006). It was interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC AS2 system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA, USA) using high-energy collision dissociation. Each fraction was loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (0.3 mm i.d.×5 mm length, 5 μm particle size) with a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 10 min. Reversed-phase C18 chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out on a pre-packed BetaBasic C18 PicoFrit column (75 μm i.d.×10 cm length, New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) at 300 nL/min with the following gradient: 5% B for 1 min as an equilibration status; 60% B for 99 min as a gradient; 90% B for 5 min as a washing status; 5% B for 10 min as an equilibration status (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in 97% water, 3% acetonitrile; solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in 97% acetonitrile, 3% water).2.4. Proteomics analyses The MS/MS data were processed by a thorough search considering biological modification and amino acid substitution against the non-redundant uniprot Arabidopsis thaliana database (53,270 entries downloaded on June 14, 2014, at http://beta.uniprot.org) by using the Fraglet and Taglet searches under the Paragon algorithm (Shilov et al., 2007) of ProteinPilot v.4.5 software (AB Sciex, Inc.) and Sequest search (Eng et al., 1994) under Proteome Discoverer v.1.4 software (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). Mascot searches (Perkins et al., 1999) under Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA) were conducted with the following parameters: trypsin digestion allowing for up to two missed cleavages, methionine oxidation and iTRAQ on N-termini and lysines, iTRAQ 8-plex quantification, 10 ppm tolerance for MS and MS/MS, peptide charges of +1, +2, and +3, and monoisotopic masses. Plant protein, cysteine modification with methyl methanethiosulfate, fixed iTRAQ modification of free amine in the N-terminus and lysine, and variable iTRAQ modifications of tyrosine were considered. ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to cluster peptides to proteins (protein groups) and output lists of proteins having a minimum peptide probability of >0.95 and a minimum protein probability of <0.95 from all search results for final identification at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR; for comparison of FDRs, see Supplementary Fig. S2) (Tang et al., 2008). Systematic bias was corrected from non-redundant spectrum per peptide from all three search algorithms by using intensity normalization of protein quantification across samples by ProteoIQ2.7 (PREMIER Biosoft). Protein relative quantification was performed by using the ratios from tandem mass spectra when the peptides were uniquely assigned to detected protein. To be identified as being significantly differentially expressed, a protein had to be quantified with at least three peptides in experimental replicates, a p value <0.05, and a fold change >1.2 or <0.8 as determined with a Fisher's combined probability of <0.05 (Fisher, 1948). For identified proteins, the functional annotation was assigned to identified protein sequences by Blast2GO suite (Conesa et al., 2005) (http://www.blast2go.com/b2ghome) and confirmed with the Arabidopsis functional catalog (Bevan et al., 1998). In addition, we used parametric analysis of gene set enrichment (PAGE) of the agriGO tool (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO) to determine specifically enriched biological processes. The proteomics data are available for public access at the PRIDE Archive–proteomics data repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive). The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcaino et al., 2014) with the data-set identifier PXD001179 and DOI 10.6019/PXD001179.2.5. Comparison of proteomic data with microarray data The proteomics data were compared with a previous gene expression study (Paul et al., 2013), which involved plants from the same experiment series on the ISS. In this comparison, we included 480 genes determined to be differentially expressed at the transcript level from that study and 546 differentially expressed proteins from this study. Among them, 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels for those commonly differentially expressed genes, correlation tests for which Pearson's r and Spearman's rho (rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of those 34 genes using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. Those genes or proteins not differentially expressed at both the protein and transcript levels were not included in the correlation analysis.2.6. Network analysis The differentially abundant proteins were examined for cell wall associations by using SUBA3 searches (Tanz et al., 2013). The proteins returned with cell wall associations from SUBA3 were analyzed for interaction networking with GeneMANIA (Warde-Farley et al., 2010) with the Co-localization, Physical interactions, and Shared protein domains options, and Gene Ontology–based weighting.3. Results 3.1. Protein recovery and identification in spaceflight material RNAlater is widely used as an RNA preservative, primarily because it is a strong protein denaturant. Proteins can be recovered from RNAlater-preserved materials (van Eijsden et al., 2013), but because the tissues and proteins are denatured, the biological properties of the subcellular components or proteins were not used to pre-separate proteins into classes such as soluble, cytoplasmic, membrane, or cell wall proteins. Therefore, the proteins identified in this study are simply considered soluble proteins according to the protocol used for their extraction. Sufficient protein was recovered from each sample to proceed with iTRAQ methods. Over 1500 proteins were identified in the root and leaf samples at a global FDR of 5% against the decoy database, and over 1300 proteins in each sample at an FDR of 1% (see Supplementary Fig. S2). An FDR of 5% was chosen as the cutoff for further analysis of proteins in this study. Of the 1570 proteins identified in the samples at 5% FDR, 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins were identified with three or more protein-unique peptides, thus allowing them to be accurately quantified across the various flight and ground control samples (Fig. 2). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab The number of proteins in the leaf and root samples meeting all the criteria for quantitation by iTRAQ. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast)3.2. Differential protein abundance in spaceflight A Fisher's test of combined probabilities was used to determine differences in quantitation values for each protein identified with three or more unique peptides. The Fisher's test accounted for the number of peptides identified in each sample, together with the biological replicates of the root samples, to produce a p value for comparison of spaceflight versus ground controls for leaves and roots. Volcano plots of the p values and differential abundance as fold change of the root and leaf samples are presented in Fig. 3. Currently, an iTRAQ method underestimates fold changes, implying small changes may indicate significant differences between samples (Bantscheff et al., 2008; DeSouza et al., 2009; Karp et al., 2010); thus, most iTRAQ studies use fold changes of <0.8 or >1.2. Therefore, proteins were considered differentially abundant with p values greater than the threshold value (α=0.05) and fold-change values in excess of 0.8 and 1.2. Figure 4 shows Venn diagrams of the number of proteins differing in abundance between spaceflight and ground control samples. Of the 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins that were able to be accurately quantified, 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins met the criteria of statistical significance by p value and differential abundance by fold change in the spaceflight samples. Only 41 of the significant differentially abundant proteins were shared between roots and leaves (Fig. 4). FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Volcano plots of differential expression between spaceflight and ground tissues. Negative log10 p values were plotted on the y axis with log2 normalized fold change expression levels on the x axis. Significant differential expression with p value threshold values α=0.05 were present in areas exceeding the 0.8 and 1.2 of fold change threshold values. Red and green dots indicate up- and down-regulated protein in flight tissues relative to ground tissues.

Open in a new tab Summary of the differential protein accumulation in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Overall, 358 root and 256 shoot proteins were differentially represented in the spaceflight sample. When parsed by whether the protein was increased or decreased in spaceflight, 237 root proteins and 200 shoot proteins were up-regulated and accumulated to more abundance in spaceflight, while 121 root proteins and 56 shoot proteins were down-regulated in spaceflight. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast)In roots, 237 proteins were up-regulated in spaceflight, with an increase in abundance in the spaceflight samples meeting the significance criteria. In those same root samples, 121 proteins were found to be down-regulated and less abundant in spaceflight. For leaves, 200 proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, while 56 were less abundant. Again, few of these differentially regulated proteins were shared between the root and leaf samples. Only 47 proteins were similarly differentially abundant in both roots and leaves in spaceflight, being similarly increased or decreased in both tissues (Fig. 5). There were 21 proteins that were shared between roots and leaves but increased in one tissue and decreased in the other. A summary Venn diagram and table is presented at the bottom of Fig. 4. FIG. 5.

Table 1 is available in color online at www.liebertonline.com/ast. 3.3. Functional analysis of proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight When the proteomic changes were highlighted in global metabolic pathways (http://pmn.plantcyc.org/overviewsWeb/celOv.shtml?orgid=ARA), the effects of spaceflight were obviously different between leaf and root tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3 and also referring elements of Table 1). In addition, PAGE showed quite distinct patterns between leaves and roots when comparing the differential abundance based on the functional classification of the proteins (Table 2). For example, responses to light stimulus and response to radiation were similar, as were pathways involving cell wall metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table 2). Interestingly, in leaves, categories of proteins related to several biological pathways were up-regulated, including stress and defense responses, photosynthesis, translation, gene expression, and cellular component biogenesis, while categories of proteins involved in the functional generation of precursor metabolites and energy, localization, and transport were repressed. In addition, categories of proteins related to specific molecular functions, such as carbohydrate binding, structural constituent of ribosome, and isomerase activity, were up-regulated in response to spaceflight in leaves. However, categories associated with cell structure exhibited abundance in leaves and scarcity in roots. In roots, protein categories associated with several biological processes, such as cofactor metabolism, oxidative stress responses, and cellular lipid metabolism, showed increased abundance. The abundance of protein categories associated with basic molecular functions, such as ATP binding, adenyl ribonucleotide binding, adenyl nucleotide binding, purine nucleoside binding, and nucleoside binding, were also enhanced in roots.

Comparison of proteomic and gene expression data The proteomics data presented here were derived from Arabidopsis grown in Run 1B of the TAGES series of plant growth experiments. Gene expression from microarray data are available from Run 3A of the TAGES experiments (Paul et al., 2013), which involved similar-aged plants grown under very similar conditions on the ISS. The 546 differentially expressed proteins of the present study were compared to the 480 genes exhibiting differential transcript levels in the previous study. The genes encoding most of the proteins quantified in this study did not show a differential mRNA expression, and many of the proteins for genes differentially regulated at the mRNA level were not identified in this proteomics survey. A total of 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. Their transcript and protein fold-change values are compared in Fig. 5. Among the genes and proteins that do show differential expression, there is a positive correlation between direction and degree of differential expression (r=0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; rs=0.5087163, p value=0.0001618). To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels, correlation tests for which Pearson's r and Spearman's rho (rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of 34 genes by using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. As shown in Fig. 5, there is a positive correlation in direction and degree of differential expression between transcript and protein expression (r=0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; rs=0.5087163, p value=0.0001618).3.5. Cell wall metabolism interaction network An interaction network was constructed to investigate potential functional relationships among the spaceflight differential proteins that are potentially involved in cell wall interactions and metabolisms. Figure 6 shows the results of the interaction analysis with several key collections of proteins highlighted. Physical interactions, shared protein domains, and co-localizations draw nearly all the cell wall–identified proteins of this study into a codified network that links cell wall carbohydrate enzymology with cell-cell interactions and signaling. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Interaction network of cell wall–related proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight.

Discussion The technical goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using RNAlater-preserved plant tissue, harvested and frozen on orbit, for broad-scale proteomics analysis of Arabidopsis spaceflight responses. RNAlater preservation of Arabidopsis within KFTs on orbit is commonly practiced, and a facile process pathway exists for harvesting to RNAlater and frozen sample return from the ISS. RNAlater-preserved plant materials from the ISS have been extensively used for gene expression analyses; however, to date, the use of RNAlater-preserved ISS material for proteomics has been limited to yeast (van Eijsden et al., 2013). The ability to conduct proteomics analyses on the same samples or on parallel samples returning from this established process pathway would advance the analysis potential for understanding Arabidopsis responses to spaceflight. This study demonstrated that sufficient protein amounts can be isolated from ISS samples preserved in RNAlater to allow broad-scale proteomics studies. Basically, enough protein was recovered from roots and leaves of 12-day-old plants from half a 10 cm2 Petri plate to conduct proteomic analyses rich enough to return the identities of 1570 proteins and to conduct quantitation on 1432 proteins with iTRAQ methods and relying on at least three unique peptides per protein. Moreover, the methods are sufficiently robust that true biological replicates are consistent and can support statistical methods for evaluation of quantitative differences among sample treatments. These RNAlater iTRAQ methods join frozen native sample recovery and non-isotopic methods (Mazars et al., 2014) as methods that have had successful initial application to space proteomics analyses of plants. It is very likely that the rapid advances in MS currently occurring will raise the number of proteins that can be quantitated in similar future studies that use this or any other sample recovery strategy. And as orbital preservation methods mature and are more broadly applied, informative comparative analyses among various species, growth conditions, and experiment protocols on orbit will become increasingly effective. The proteomic data from this study of three combined Arabidopsis lines support the general notion that plants engage specific metabolic responses to accomplish physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but that response is different among organs (Paul et al., 2013). The primary data supporting this conclusion are shown in Figs. 2 and 4. Of 885 proteins commonly quantified in roots and leaves, only 47 were similarly regulated in the spaceflight leaf and root samples. In contrast, 290 and 288 proteins in roots and leaves were uniquely differentially regulated by spaceflight in either one organ or the other. Moreover, pathway and process analysis of these differentially accumulated proteins indicates that roots and leaves are altering different pathways in response to spaceflight. There appears, broadly speaking, to be no single response at the proteomic level that is employed by all tissues of the plant in order to adapt to spaceflight. There are, however, a few common threads among the data sets. These data complement results of Mazars et al. (2014), who used a non-isotopic proteomics approach to examine spaceflight microgravity effects on membrane proteins of whole Arabidopsis seedlings. Their study used seedlings that were grown within chambers in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 12 days on the ISS, with the entire chambers frozen on orbit to allow recovery of frozen seedlings after return to Earth. Microsomal fractions were prepared from the whole seedlings and subjected to a label-free MS analysis. Thus, their analysis used different tissues, different preservation on orbit, different sample preparation that focused on microsomes, and different MS methods. Mazars and colleagues found that 69 microsomal proteins were specifically more abundant in microgravity (compared to ground and 1g controls), while 80 microsomal proteins were less abundant in microgravity. By using strictly TAIR AGI accession number as the link between their data and the data presented here, there are 23 proteins identified in common between the two studies. More generally, Mazars et al. (2014) concluded that proteins involved in signaling, trafficking, auxin metabolism, stress, and cell wall metabolism are influenced by microgravity, a conclusion that is supported and extended by the study presented here, with auxin signaling and cell wall remodeling being similarly identified here as altered by spaceflight. Many of the proteins identified here as differentially abundant in spaceflight are associated with auxin metabolism, and a large number are associated with cell wall modification that makes sense in light of the morphologies demonstrated by spaceflight roots (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2013; Nakashima et al., 2014). Of the differentially represented proteins presented in Table 1, 95 are associated with cell walls or cell wall metabolism either by Gene Ontology annotation or by reference when using SUBA3 searches (Tanz et al., 2013). The interaction network in Fig. 6 shows that most of these cell wall–associated proteins can be considered within a framework of functionally interactive proteins engaged in cell wall activities. There are many enzymes, such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, involved in cell wall carbohydrate modification, deconstruction, and remodeling present in the heart of the network (dark gray highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Gilbert 2010). The well-represented FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans (medium gray highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Seifert et al., 2014) and a SKU5-like protein are involved in cell shape and cell-cell interactions. For instance, SKU5-similar proteins encode an extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein involved in directional root growth in expanding cells. Mutants in this gene phenocopy the growth patterns seen on orbit in that they over-skew to the left (Sedbrook et al., 2002). FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans have been shown to positively modulate ABA-regulated root growth patterns in plants exposed to abiotic stress, and it is postulated that they function by interacting with mediators of ABA in a plasma membrane subdomain (Seifert et al., 2014). Fasciclins are typically associated with the outer face of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane via their GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor (Johnson et al., 2003; Demir et al., 2013). Two cell wall–associated lipid transfer proteins are also differentially represented in the differential spaceflight proteome (light gray highlight in Fig. 6). There is strong representation of cell wall peroxidases (green highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Bellincampi et al., 2014) and cell wall lectins (brown highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Kauss and Glaser 1974; Albenne et al., 2009) in the network, connecting key metabolism, stress response, and cell expansion activities in the network of proteins differentially regulated by spaceflight. There are also a number of proteins that are connected by a domain of unknown function (DUF) deeply involved in cell wall metabolism (lower left in Fig. 6) (e.g., Garza-Caligaris et al., 2012; Vazquez-Lobo et al., 2012). These proteomics studies offered an initial opportunity to potentially integrate information on spaceflight responses at the protein and mRNA levels in that these samples were derived from very similar grow-outs on the ISS to the transcriptomics studies of Paul et al. (2013). A direct comparison of differential protein levels and their corresponding transcript expression levels does show some correlation. However, only a small portion of the differential transcripts are represented in the differential protein levels, and vice versa. This is, however, in agreement with previous studies in yeast (Futcher et al., 1999; Gygi et al., 1999; Washburn et al., 2003), mice (Tian et al., 2004), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Nie et al., 2006), E. coli (Ishihama et al., 2005), Tragopogon (Koh et al., 2012), and cotton (Hu et al., 2013), showing that transcript abundances only partially predict protein abundances and that a series of regulatory processes involved in translation, localization, modification, and protein degradation play a substantial role in controlling protein expression (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). Nonetheless, conclusions based on the proteomics and transcriptomics levels closely interrelate when examining protein name or function as opposed to strict TAIR accession number. The exact same gene/protein may not be represented in the corresponding transcriptome, yet the differential proteome from these samples displays a similar engagement of cell wall remodeling tools in response to spaceflight as seen in the transcriptome from similar samples. Roots and leaves adapt differently to spaceflight at the level of proteomics. While there are some commonalities among the spaceflight proteome changes in roots and leaves, such as cell wall metabolism, the present data indicate that roots and leaves invoke differential proteome responses to spaceflight. This is consistent with transcriptome data that also indicate differential spaceflight responses in leaves and roots (Paul et al., 2013). It is likely that, as proteomics technologies as well as gene expression and other omics technologies achieve increased density of coverage and finer spatial resolution, it will be revealed that different cell types within organs respond differently to spaceflight. And as increased numbers of biological experiments are enabled on the ISS, it is likely that multiple approaches will combine to yield both cell-specific response pathways as well as more general principles involved in plant spaceflight adaptation. Cell wall modifications in spaceflight, in addition to or governed by auxin signaling, may be one of those general and recurring metabolic adaptations that may be in common among plants and plant tissues, even if enacted by various proteins and genes that differ among cell types or genotypes.Supplementary Material Supplemental data Supp_Fig1.pdf (100KB, pdf) Supplemental data Supp_Fig2.pdf (52.2KB, pdf) Supplemental data Supp_Fig3.pdf (288.5KB, pdf) Acknowledgments The authors thank the entire line of NASA space biology professionals that made this research possible.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515520/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Since the times of the Darwins’ treatise on the power of movement in plants1 and the experiments of Cholodny and Went2 gravity has been established as central to many patterns of plant development.3–5 Gravity-dependent changes in root growth direction are keyed by changes in the auxin distribution within the root tip. During gravistimulation, starch-containing amyloplasts migrate to the downward side of the root columella cells, initiating migration of PIN proteins that then cause asymmetric redistribution of auxin toward the lower side of the root, which in turn causes curvature in the elongation zone to reestablish the root into a vertical orientation.3,6–11 This series of signaling events acts upon a well-characterized distribution of auxin that arises from a flow of auxin from the aerial portions of the plant through the central stele toward the root tip with an accumulation of auxin in the columella cells, which is then relieved by a flow back toward the aerial portions of the plant through the outer root cell layers. The movement and differential accumulation of auxin within specific root tip cells is known as the ‘reverse fountain’ model9,12–14 (Figure 1a). It is this auxin accumulation and flow that forms the primary basis of the root’s ability to respond to gravity.10,15 Implicit in model’s name is the notion that gravity establishes at least part of the pattern of distribution, just as drops from a water fountain fall after the propelling force is overcome by gravity. Most references to these gravity-driven responses compare “vertical” to “gravistimulated”, as if vertical is the ground state. The term vertical, defined as an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, inexorably creates an implicit relationship in which the fundamental auxin reverse fountain is established and oriented along the Earth’s gravity vector.

One of the major values of work on the ISS is the ability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. This allows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, for example, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing can be decoupled from the auxin flow.16–19 We used Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) lines expressing gravity signaling fluorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxin artificial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP)20 as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip, especially in the central columella cells (C), and a Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis fusion (pTAA1::TAA1–GFP)21 to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC). We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR–GFP),22 to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatory role in auxin biosynthesis,11 to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free-cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis Response Regulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarly distributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter (pARR5::GUS).23",

    "results": "Results This study used two methods of microscopy to evaluate the distribution of auxin and cytokinin green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene products in Arabidopsis roots during development in the spaceflight environment compared with ground controls; live imaging with standard fluorescence optics in real time on the ISS and confocal imaging of preserved, returned samples. The results are a compilation of imaging data from two independent ISS experiments; CARA conducted in 2014 and APEX03-02 in 2015. This allowed an analysis of different growing conditions on the ISS and separate flight experiences with regard to signaling in the Arabidopsis primary root. The region of interest in these evaluations is comprised of the root tip cells that participate in auxin transport (Figure 1a). Of particular interest are the columella cells and columella initials (green, Figure 1a), the cells of the quiescent center and surrounding initials (peach and dark blue, Figure 1a), the endodermis (light blue, Figure 1a) and the stele (white, Figure 1a). Figure 1b provides a confocal micrograph of the region diagramed in Figure 1a and shows the typical reference expression pattern of GFP signal from DR5r::GFP in a 4-day-old Arabidopsis root. Plant development and root morphology is different between the CARA and APEX03-2 experiments The CARA and the APEX03-2 experiments represent two very different approaches to conducting a plant experiment on the ISS, and the plants grown within these two distinct experiments exhibit distinct morphologies. Within each experiment, however, the environmental conditions between the spaceflight habitat and the ground control habitat were comparable. The reduced lighting habitat of the CARA plants resulted in slower development relative to their chronological age in comparison to plants grown under the higher light levels of APEX03, as can be seen examining the 8-day plants of Figure 2d,g. The roots of the spaceflight CARA plants grew in tight loops and coils (Figure 2d,g), which is a distinctly different morphology than was seen in previous spaceflight-grown Arabidopsis plants.24,25 The 4-day and 8-day APEX03-2 plants housed in the more optimal lighting environment of the Vegetable Production System (VPS) displayed the more advanced development expected for plants growing under a higher light environment (Figure 2e,f,h,i) than did the plants in the lower light environment of CARA. The roots of the 4-day APEX03-2 spaceflight plants were more linear in appearance, and exhibited much of the skewing behavior observed in pervious spaceflight experiments (Figure 2h). However, the 8-day plants of APEX03-2 (Figure 2i) were far less organized than the straighter growth seen previously in the directional light environment of the Advanced Biological Research System ABRS hardware,24,25 but still did not grow in the tight loops and coils of the CARA plants (Figure 2g). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Experiment configuration and spaceflight-unique operations. The Petri plates of plants in CARA were grown in ambient lighting in the ISS on the interior wall of the Destiny module of the ISS (a), while the APEX03-2 experiment the plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) in the Columbus module of the ISS.

The spaceflight distribution of DR5r::GFP was indistinguishable from that of vertically grown roots on the Earth in two separate spaceflight experiments The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the roots of plants grown on the ISS was identical to that of the ground controls over the course of the two different ISS experiments and several plant ages. (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S1). The APEX03-2 experiment was comprised of plants grown in the VPS growth facility (Figure 2b,c) and then imaged in the LMM after 4 and 8 days of growth (Figure 2e,f,h,i). In addition, 4-day-old samples from APEX03-2 were fixed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit, enabling confocal microscopy after sample return. Plants of the CARA experiment were grown in ambient cabin lighting of the ISS for 5 days before imaging (Figure 2a,d,g). As detailed in the Materials and Methods section, the comparable ground controls for both experiments were grown in a specialized chamber programed with the environmental parameters (CO2, temperature, humidity, and lighting) experienced by the ISS-grown plants, and all live imaging on the ISS conducted with the LMM (Figure 3) was directly compared with the LMM Ground Imaging Unit (GIU).

GFP, green fluorescent protein; ISS, International Space Station; LMM, Light Microscopy Module.Live imaging with the LMM on orbit illustrates that the same pattern of DR5r::GFP distribution was seen in the spaceflight grown and ground control plants of APEX03-2 in both 4-day-old (Figure 4a,b) and 8-day-old (Figure 4c,d) plants. Developmental age did not impact DR5r::GFP distribution in CARA either. The distribution of DR5r::GFP was identical in spaceflight and ground control plants for both 5-day-old (Figure 4e,f) and 8-day-old roots of the CARA plants (Figure 4g,h). In all cases, the LMM images of DR5r::GFP were consistent with expression patterns appropriately limited to the cells of the columella. Confocal microscopy with RNAlater-preserved roots from APEX03-2 enabled cellular resolution of the columella. The cellular resolution showed that the distribution of DR5r::GFP observed in the live imaging was indeed localized to the columella. The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the columella cells of the ground control (Figure 4i) and spaceflight (Figure 4j) was unchanged with respect to the gravity environment (see also Supplementary Movie S1 and Supplementary Movie S2). Quantification of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed no significant quantitative differences in the expression between spaceflight and ground control samples for pDR5r::GFP (T-test, P=0.55; Supplementary Figure S1). Distributions of two proteins associated with auxin signaling were also unchanged in spaceflight The distributions of TAA1::TAA1–GFP and SCR::SCR–GFP, respectively, were identical in between spaceflight and ground control plants. The TAA1::TAA1–GFP and SCR::SCR–GFP reporter gene lines were used in the APEX03-2 experiment (Figure 2e,f,h,i), and as with the DR5r::GFP plants, 4-day-old samples were fixed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit for confocal microscopy. There was no change in the distribution of TAA1::TAA1–GFP expression in the cells in and around the quiescent center (Figure 1a) between spaceflight and ground control plants. The individual cells involved could be seen with confocal imaging of preserved returned samples (Figure 5a,b, and Supplementary Movies S3, S4), which supported the identical position of TAA1::TAA1–GFP between flight and ground that was seen in the root tip during live imaging with the LMM (Figure 5e,f). Quantification of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed potential slightly higher expression levels in spaceflight for TAA1::TAA1–GFP that were not statistically well supported (T-test, P=0.06; Supplementary Figure S1).

Live imaging with the LMM showed a contiguous endodermal surface for both spaceflight and ground control (Figure 5g,h). In returned samples examined with confocal microcopy, longitudinal Z-sections through the endodermal layer (refer to Figure 1a) displayed some variably among samples near the QC, but this variation was not consistent within treatments (Figure 5c,d, and inset of Figure 3d). The distribution of cytokinin was different in spaceflight as compared with ground control roots The distribution of ARR5::GFP was different in the spaceflight grown plants compared to the comparable ground controls. Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP expression compared with ground controls. In the 5-day roots of CARA, ARR5::GFP expression was restricted to the very tip of the root in spaceflight roots (Figure 5j), whereas the roots of the ground controls showed the typical pattern of ARR5 expression, which extends away from the tip back along the stele (Figures 1a and 5i).23 The spaceflight expression of ARR5::GFP remained limited to the tip even after 8 days of growth, while in the ground controls the distribution of ARR5::GFP continued to extend acropetally (Figure 5k,l).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The plants examined here were derived from two distinct spaceflight experiments. CARA and APEX03-2 were launched months apart, and utilized different hardware and growth habitats. The developmental appearance and root growth strategies of respective plants from CARA and APEX were quite different (Figure 2d–i). This diversity provided the opportunity to observe auxin signaling in two different ISS growth habitats and two distinct spaceflight experiences separated by several months, which thereby removed the possibility of experiment processing, or local environmental factors other than spaceflight, impacting the results. It is well established that there are changes in root morphology and in the gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis plants grown in a spaceflight environment, and many of the differentially expressed genes are associated with auxin and cytokinin signaling.24,26–28 However, global patterns of gene expression from whole roots24 or whole seedlings26–28 do not reveal changes that occur in individual cells. Here we employ GFP reporter gene systems that enable the visualization of gene expression within distinct cell types of the primary root tip providing cell-specific data that would otherwise be masked in a molecular study pooling all the cells of the root. Plants in the microgravity of spaceflight establish an auxin distribution that is indistinguishable from that of a vertical orientation on the Earth. The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the roots of plants grown on the ISS was identical to that of the ground controls over the course of the two ISS experiments, several plant ages, and varied root morphologies (Figure 4). The expression of DR5r::GFP was evident in, and appropriately limited to, the columella cells of the root tip. The columella cells are considered the primary gravity-sensing cells of the root29 and the DR5r::GFP expression patterns observed on the ISS are consistent with previous reports of DR5r::GFP distribution in the primary roots of plants grown vertically on the Earth.8 In both, the live imaging on orbit with the LMM (Figure 4a–h) and the cellular resolution made possible with the confocal analysis of preserved samples (Figure 4i,j), there is no discernable difference in the distribution of DR5r::GFP expression between ISS-grown plants and their comparable ground controls. Though widely used for characterizing auxin distribution, as a transcriptional reporter DR5r::GFP does have limitations in sensitivity and response time for reporting auxin locations and concentrations, and it does not reveal all aspects of auxin-responsive gene activity. The initial observations presented here could be extended greatly in future flights through the use of more sensitive and non-transcriptional auxin reporter systems. In addition, exploration of sites of auxin action away from the root tip, such as shoots, root flanks and junctions, as well as lateral roots, would provide valuable additional insights into the spaceflight influences on auxin roles in plants not experiencing unit gravity. Plants in spaceflight also appear unchanged with respect to a second source of auxin; synthesis of auxin within the quiescent center. Auxin is synthesized in the QC cells, cells that are part of the stem cell niche (SCN) in the root apical meristem and that give rise to the gravity-sensing columella cells of the root tip21 (Figure 1a). The importance of this source of auxin to the gravity-sensing mechanism in roots is revealed by the fact excised root tips, without the auxin source of the reverse fountain, exhibit a response to gravity.30 We used the pTAA1::TAA1–GFP native promoter protein fusion reporter to monitor the amount of the auxin in these essential QC cells. TAA1 encodes an aminotransferase that regulates auxin biosynthesis within the QC cells, and contributes to gravitropic signaling.31 The TAA1::TAA1–GFP in 5-day and 8-day-old plants on orbit showed a distribution of GFP expression that was indistinguishable from similarly grown ground control plants (Figure 5a,b,e,f), and is consistent with what is typically expected in vertically grown plants.21 These results suggest that auxin synthesis of the QC is not influenced by gravity. Also unchanged in microgravity is the distribution of the GRAS family transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR), a key transcription factor involved in the maintenance of the SCN32 and regulating the radial organization of the root.22,33–35 SCR is essential to stem cell activity in the root apical meristem, the organization of the root cap and QC, as well as the production of auxin as it contributes to the reverse fountain flow. In the QC, SCR negatively regulates genes associated with auxin biosynthesis and mediates phytohormone cross-talk among the actively growing root zones.11 There was no discernable difference in the nuclear localization pattern of SCR::SCR–GFP between the root endodermis and QC of the plants grown on the ISS and the comparable ground controls (Figure 5c,d,g,h). This suggests that the upstream regulatory circuits for critical auxin synthesis steps are intact in spaceflight. The spaceflight distribution of SCR::SCR–GFP, together with the expression of TAA1::TAA1–GFP and DR5::GFP, strongly suggests that the entire auxin signaling pathway is fully developed in the absence of gravity. Unlike the distribution of auxin, the phytohormone cytokinin exhibited different patterns of distribution between the spaceflight and ground environments. Cytokinins are counterpoints to auxin, including in the cross-talk among the root zones that plays a role in gravity responses.36,37 We examined the distribution cytokinin using ARR5::GFP, as the ARR5 gene is induced in the presence of free cytokinin.23 Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP compared to ground controls (Figure 5i–l). In the flight plants, the expression of ARR5::GFP appeared limited to the columella and lateral root cap, whereas in the ground control plants ARR5::GFP expression extended shoot-ward from the root tip through the stele. The primary source for cytokinin production in the root tip is the columella cells. In a vertical orientation on the Earth, ARR5 expression is highest in the columella, but also extends shoot-ward through the stele, a pattern that can expand in response to gravistimulation.23 On the Earth, cytokinins also have roles in root curving,38 coiling and waving, and can influence features of the actin filament organization, which in turn affects root growth patterns.39,40 Plants grown on the ISS exhibit altered waving and skewing morphologies, as well as differences in the patterns of cell division and elongation.25 It is possible that cytokinin plays a larger role in these altered root growth strategies than does auxin, in the absence of gravity experienced during spaceflight. In addition, the repressed distribution of cytokinin as revealed by ARR expression in the spaceflight grown roots may also reflect a cytokinin influence in overall reduction in growth rate and development.41,42 Our results demonstrate one of the values in conducting experiments on the ISS; the ability to remove gravity from the environment and thus examine the role of gravity in fundamental biological processes. In this particular case, our data show that auxin distributions of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared with the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip. Indeed, these experiments that essentially remove the forces of gravity, join with previous studies that used genetics to uncouple gravitropism from auxin distribution (for example, refs. 16–19) to complete the notion that auxin gradients in the primary root are fundamentally developmental. Those developmental auxin gradients were coopted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. The role of auxin in structures other than the root tip bears investigation, as auxin-regulated genes are seen to change in expression during spaceflight, when examining the root as a whole, and root architecture is also influenced by spaceflight. The value of the present study is in having cell-specific reporters to begin the challenge of finding where in the root potential spaceflight auxin-regulated changes do occur. The data presented here suggest that those auxin-related changes do not occur in the major gravity-sensing cells of the primary root tip, as the distribution of DR5::GFP TAA::GFP and SCR::GFP are not affected by spaceflight at least to the level of sensitivity afforded by these reporters. There is unintended and unrealized bias in some of the terminology used to describe the gravity response mechanisms and models of primary roots, in that there is an unwritten implication that the default or resting auxin distribution of the primary root is set up by gravity; that it is the vertical orientation that sets up the auxin distribution in the root tip. The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.",

Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.Introduction Since the times of the Darwins’ treatise on the power of movement in plants1 and the experiments of Cholodny and Went2 gravity has been established as central to many patterns of plant development.3–5 Gravity-dependent changes in root growth direction are keyed by changes in the auxin distribution within the root tip. During gravistimulation, starch-containing amyloplasts migrate to the downward side of the root columella cells, initiating migration of PIN proteins that then cause asymmetric redistribution of auxin toward the lower side of the root, which in turn causes curvature in the elongation zone to reestablish the root into a vertical orientation.3,6–11 This series of signaling events acts upon a well-characterized distribution of auxin that arises from a flow of auxin from the aerial portions of the plant through the central stele toward the root tip with an accumulation of auxin in the columella cells, which is then relieved by a flow back toward the aerial portions of the plant through the outer root cell layers. The movement and differential accumulation of auxin within specific root tip cells is known as the ‘reverse fountain’ model9,12–14 (Figure 1a). It is this auxin accumulation and flow that forms the primary basis of the root’s ability to respond to gravity.10,15 Implicit in model’s name is the notion that gravity establishes at least part of the pattern of distribution, just as drops from a water fountain fall after the propelling force is overcome by gravity. Most references to these gravity-driven responses compare “vertical” to “gravistimulated”, as if vertical is the ground state. The term vertical, defined as an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, inexorably creates an implicit relationship in which the fundamental auxin reverse fountain is established and oriented along the Earth’s gravity vector.

GFP, green fluorescent protein.We wished to know whether gravity has a direct physiologic role in establishing the auxin reverse fountain signaling system in primary roots. One of the major values of work on the ISS is the ability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. This allows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, for example, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing can be decoupled from the auxin flow.16–19 We used Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) lines expressing gravity signaling fluorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxin artificial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP)20 as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip, especially in the central columella cells (C), and a Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis fusion (pTAA1::TAA1–GFP)21 to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC). We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR–GFP),22 to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatory role in auxin biosynthesis,11 to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free-cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis Response Regulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarly distributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter (pARR5::GUS).23Results This study used two methods of microscopy to evaluate the distribution of auxin and cytokinin green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene products in Arabidopsis roots during development in the spaceflight environment compared with ground controls; live imaging with standard fluorescence optics in real time on the ISS and confocal imaging of preserved, returned samples. The results are a compilation of imaging data from two independent ISS experiments; CARA conducted in 2014 and APEX03-02 in 2015. This allowed an analysis of different growing conditions on the ISS and separate flight experiences with regard to signaling in the Arabidopsis primary root. The region of interest in these evaluations is comprised of the root tip cells that participate in auxin transport (Figure 1a). Of particular interest are the columella cells and columella initials (green, Figure 1a), the cells of the quiescent center and surrounding initials (peach and dark blue, Figure 1a), the endodermis (light blue, Figure 1a) and the stele (white, Figure 1a). Figure 1b provides a confocal micrograph of the region diagramed in Figure 1a and shows the typical reference expression pattern of GFP signal from DR5r::GFP in a 4-day-old Arabidopsis root. Plant development and root morphology is different between the CARA and APEX03-2 experiments The CARA and the APEX03-2 experiments represent two very different approaches to conducting a plant experiment on the ISS, and the plants grown within these two distinct experiments exhibit distinct morphologies. Within each experiment, however, the environmental conditions between the spaceflight habitat and the ground control habitat were comparable. The reduced lighting habitat of the CARA plants resulted in slower development relative to their chronological age in comparison to plants grown under the higher light levels of APEX03, as can be seen examining the 8-day plants of Figure 2d,g. The roots of the spaceflight CARA plants grew in tight loops and coils (Figure 2d,g), which is a distinctly different morphology than was seen in previous spaceflight-grown Arabidopsis plants.24,25 The 4-day and 8-day APEX03-2 plants housed in the more optimal lighting environment of the Vegetable Production System (VPS) displayed the more advanced development expected for plants growing under a higher light environment (Figure 2e,f,h,i) than did the plants in the lower light environment of CARA. The roots of the 4-day APEX03-2 spaceflight plants were more linear in appearance, and exhibited much of the skewing behavior observed in pervious spaceflight experiments (Figure 2h). However, the 8-day plants of APEX03-2 (Figure 2i) were far less organized than the straighter growth seen previously in the directional light environment of the Advanced Biological Research System ABRS hardware,24,25 but still did not grow in the tight loops and coils of the CARA plants (Figure 2g). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Experiment configuration and spaceflight-unique operations. The Petri plates of plants in CARA were grown in ambient lighting in the ISS on the interior wall of the Destiny module of the ISS (a), while the APEX03-2 experiment the plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) in the Columbus module of the ISS. The placement and scale of the VPS is provided in b; the expanded unit containing racks of APEX 10-cm2 plates is shown in c.

(Figure 4, Supplementary Table S1). The APEX03-2 experiment was comprised of plants grown in the VPS growth facility (Figure 2b,c) and then imaged in the LMM after 4 and 8 days of growth (Figure 2e,f,h,i). In addition, 4-day-old samples from APEX03-2 were fixed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit, enabling confocal microscopy after sample return. Plants of the CARA experiment were grown in ambient cabin lighting of the ISS for 5 days before imaging (Figure 2a,d,g). As detailed in the Materials and Methods section, the comparable ground controls for both experiments were grown in a specialized chamber programed with the environmental parameters (CO2, temperature, humidity, and lighting) experienced by the ISS-grown plants, and all live imaging on the ISS conducted with the LMM (Figure 3) was directly compared with the LMM Ground Imaging Unit (GIU).

Open in a new tab Light Microscopy Module operations. The LMM is located in the Destiny Module of the ISS (a, red arrow). The Petri plate was photographed and mounted on the LMM Petri base (b, red arrow) before being inserted into the LMM (c, red arrow). The plate photograph was used to create a root map to guide the telemetric maneuvers to locate regions of interest on the Petri plates (d). The region of the plate shown in d defines the area capable of being viewed by the LMM; the red lines that telescope to b shows the approximate extent of this region on the plate mounted on the base. The x and y coordinate map for the LMM microscope stage was overlaid on the photograph of the viewing area (d); the numbers on the periphery of the viewing area are the x and y coordinates that were used to maneuvering the motorized stage by the input of numerical values from the ground.

Developmental age did not impact DR5r::GFP distribution in CARA either. The distribution of DR5r::GFP was identical in spaceflight and ground control plants for both 5-day-old (Figure 4e,f) and 8-day-old roots of the CARA plants (Figure 4g,h). In all cases, the LMM images of DR5r::GFP were consistent with expression patterns appropriately limited to the cells of the columella. Confocal microscopy with RNAlater-preserved roots from APEX03-2 enabled cellular resolution of the columella. The cellular resolution showed that the distribution of DR5r::GFP observed in the live imaging was indeed localized to the columella. The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the columella cells of the ground control (Figure 4i) and spaceflight (Figure 4j) was unchanged with respect to the gravity environment (see also Supplementary Movie S1 and Supplementary Movie S2). Quantification of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed no significant quantitative differences in the expression between spaceflight and ground control samples for pDR5r::GFP (T-test, P=0.55; Supplementary Figure S1).Distributions of two proteins associated with auxin signaling were also unchanged in spaceflight The distributions of TAA1::TAA1–GFP and SCR::SCR–GFP, respectively, were identical in between spaceflight and ground control plants. The TAA1::TAA1–GFP and SCR::SCR–GFP reporter gene lines were used in the APEX03-2 experiment (Figure 2e,f,h,i), and as with the DR5r::GFP plants, 4-day-old samples were fixed in RNAlater and frozen on orbit for confocal microscopy. There was no change in the distribution of TAA1::TAA1–GFP expression in the cells in and around the quiescent center (Figure 1a) between spaceflight and ground control plants. The individual cells involved could be seen with confocal imaging of preserved returned samples (Figure 5a,b, and Supplementary Movies S3, S4), which supported the identical position of TAA1::TAA1–GFP between flight and ground that was seen in the root tip during live imaging with the LMM (Figure 5e,f). Quantification of the confocal Z-stack volumes for GFP signal revealed potential slightly higher expression levels in spaceflight for TAA1::TAA1–GFP that were not statistically well supported (T-test, P=0.06; Supplementary Figure S1). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Distribution of other auxin and cytokinin-sensitive GFP reporters.

Images (a–d) were collected from RNAlater-preserved APEX03-2 4d samples returned to Earth, with a Leica TSC-SP5 confocal microscope.

In addition, animated 3D projections for (a) and can be found in Supplementary Movie S3, and (b) in Supplementary Movie S4. d, days; GFP, green fluorescent protein.The nuclear localization SCR::SCR–GFP in endodermal cells also appeared unchanged between flight and ground control plants. Live imaging with the LMM showed a contiguous endodermal surface for both spaceflight and ground control (Figure 5g,h). In returned samples examined with confocal microcopy, longitudinal Z-sections through the endodermal layer (refer to Figure 1a) displayed some variably among samples near the QC, but this variation was not consistent within treatments (Figure 5c,d, and inset of Figure 3d).The distribution of cytokinin was different in spaceflight as compared with ground control roots The distribution of ARR5::GFP was different in the spaceflight grown plants compared to the comparable ground controls. Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP expression compared with ground controls. In the 5-day roots of CARA, ARR5::GFP expression was restricted to the very tip of the root in spaceflight roots (Figure 5j), whereas the roots of the ground controls showed the typical pattern of ARR5 expression, which extends away from the tip back along the stele (Figures 1a and 5i).23 The spaceflight expression of ARR5::GFP remained limited to the tip even after 8 days of growth, while in the ground controls the distribution of ARR5::GFP continued to extend acropetally (Figure 5k,l).Discussion The plants examined here were derived from two distinct spaceflight experiments. CARA and APEX03-2 were launched months apart, and utilized different hardware and growth habitats. The developmental appearance and root growth strategies of respective plants from CARA and APEX were quite different (Figure 2d–i). This diversity provided the opportunity to observe auxin signaling in two different ISS growth habitats and two distinct spaceflight experiences separated by several months, which thereby removed the possibility of experiment processing, or local environmental factors other than spaceflight, impacting the results. It is well established that there are changes in root morphology and in the gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis plants grown in a spaceflight environment, and many of the differentially expressed genes are associated with auxin and cytokinin signaling.24,26–28 However, global patterns of gene expression from whole roots24 or whole seedlings26–28 do not reveal changes that occur in individual cells. Here we employ GFP reporter gene systems that enable the visualization of gene expression within distinct cell types of the primary root tip providing cell-specific data that would otherwise be masked in a molecular study pooling all the cells of the root. Plants in the microgravity of spaceflight establish an auxin distribution that is indistinguishable from that of a vertical orientation on the Earth. The distribution of DR5r::GFP in the roots of plants grown on the ISS was identical to that of the ground controls over the course of the two ISS experiments, several plant ages, and varied root morphologies (Figure 4). The expression of DR5r::GFP was evident in, and appropriately limited to, the columella cells of the root tip. The columella cells are considered the primary gravity-sensing cells of the root29 and the DR5r::GFP expression patterns observed on the ISS are consistent with previous reports of DR5r::GFP distribution in the primary roots of plants grown vertically on the Earth.8 In both, the live imaging on orbit with the LMM (Figure 4a–h) and the cellular resolution made possible with the confocal analysis of preserved samples (Figure 4i,j), there is no discernable difference in the distribution of DR5r::GFP expression between ISS-grown plants and their comparable ground controls. Though widely used for characterizing auxin distribution, as a transcriptional reporter DR5r::GFP does have limitations in sensitivity and response time for reporting auxin locations and concentrations, and it does not reveal all aspects of auxin-responsive gene activity. The initial observations presented here could be extended greatly in future flights through the use of more sensitive and non-transcriptional auxin reporter systems. In addition, exploration of sites of auxin action away from the root tip, such as shoots, root flanks and junctions, as well as lateral roots, would provide valuable additional insights into the spaceflight influences on auxin roles in plants not experiencing unit gravity. Plants in spaceflight also appear unchanged with respect to a second source of auxin; synthesis of auxin within the quiescent center. Auxin is synthesized in the QC cells, cells that are part of the stem cell niche (SCN) in the root apical meristem and that give rise to the gravity-sensing columella cells of the root tip21 (Figure 1a). The importance of this source of auxin to the gravity-sensing mechanism in roots is revealed by the fact excised root tips, without the auxin source of the reverse fountain, exhibit a response to gravity.30 We used the pTAA1::TAA1–GFP native promoter protein fusion reporter to monitor the amount of the auxin in these essential QC cells. TAA1 encodes an aminotransferase that regulates auxin biosynthesis within the QC cells, and contributes to gravitropic signaling.31 The TAA1::TAA1–GFP in 5-day and 8-day-old plants on orbit showed a distribution of GFP expression that was indistinguishable from similarly grown ground control plants (Figure 5a,b,e,f), and is consistent with what is typically expected in vertically grown plants.21 These results suggest that auxin synthesis of the QC is not influenced by gravity. Also unchanged in microgravity is the distribution of the GRAS family transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR), a key transcription factor involved in the maintenance of the SCN32 and regulating the radial organization of the root.22,33–35 SCR is essential to stem cell activity in the root apical meristem, the organization of the root cap and QC, as well as the production of auxin as it contributes to the reverse fountain flow. In the QC, SCR negatively regulates genes associated with auxin biosynthesis and mediates phytohormone cross-talk among the actively growing root zones.11 There was no discernable difference in the nuclear localization pattern of SCR::SCR–GFP between the root endodermis and QC of the plants grown on the ISS and the comparable ground controls (Figure 5c,d,g,h). This suggests that the upstream regulatory circuits for critical auxin synthesis steps are intact in spaceflight. The spaceflight distribution of SCR::SCR–GFP, together with the expression of TAA1::TAA1–GFP and DR5::GFP, strongly suggests that the entire auxin signaling pathway is fully developed in the absence of gravity. Unlike the distribution of auxin, the phytohormone cytokinin exhibited different patterns of distribution between the spaceflight and ground environments. Cytokinins are counterpoints to auxin, including in the cross-talk among the root zones that plays a role in gravity responses.36,37 We examined the distribution cytokinin using ARR5::GFP, as the ARR5 gene is induced in the presence of free cytokinin.23 Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP compared to ground controls (Figure 5i–l). In the flight plants, the expression of ARR5::GFP appeared limited to the columella and lateral root cap, whereas in the ground control plants ARR5::GFP expression extended shoot-ward from the root tip through the stele. The primary source for cytokinin production in the root tip is the columella cells. In a vertical orientation on the Earth, ARR5 expression is highest in the columella, but also extends shoot-ward through the stele, a pattern that can expand in response to gravistimulation.23 On the Earth, cytokinins also have roles in root curving,38 coiling and waving, and can influence features of the actin filament organization, which in turn affects root growth patterns.39,40 Plants grown on the ISS exhibit altered waving and skewing morphologies, as well as differences in the patterns of cell division and elongation.25 It is possible that cytokinin plays a larger role in these altered root growth strategies than does auxin, in the absence of gravity experienced during spaceflight. In addition, the repressed distribution of cytokinin as revealed by ARR expression in the spaceflight grown roots may also reflect a cytokinin influence in overall reduction in growth rate and development.41,42 Our results demonstrate one of the values in conducting experiments on the ISS; the ability to remove gravity from the environment and thus examine the role of gravity in fundamental biological processes. In this particular case, our data show that auxin distributions of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared with the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip. Indeed, these experiments that essentially remove the forces of gravity, join with previous studies that used genetics to uncouple gravitropism from auxin distribution (for example, refs. 16–19) to complete the notion that auxin gradients in the primary root are fundamentally developmental. Those developmental auxin gradients were coopted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. The role of auxin in structures other than the root tip bears investigation, as auxin-regulated genes are seen to change in expression during spaceflight, when examining the root as a whole, and root architecture is also influenced by spaceflight. The value of the present study is in having cell-specific reporters to begin the challenge of finding where in the root potential spaceflight auxin-regulated changes do occur. The data presented here suggest that those auxin-related changes do not occur in the major gravity-sensing cells of the primary root tip, as the distribution of DR5::GFP TAA::GFP and SCR::GFP are not affected by spaceflight at least to the level of sensitivity afforded by these reporters. There is unintended and unrealized bias in some of the terminology used to describe the gravity response mechanisms and models of primary roots, in that there is an unwritten implication that the default or resting auxin distribution of the primary root is set up by gravity; that it is the vertical orientation that sets up the auxin distribution in the root tip. The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.Materials and methods Spaceflight launches and NASA experiment operational nomenclature The data presented here are taken from two independent experiments launched to the ISS. CARA (Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-3 on 18 April 2014. The cargo Dragon Capsule was carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL, USA. CARA is also identified by the NASA operations nomenclature (OpNom) of “Petri Plants”, and was one of the ARK1 payloads flown by the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1064.html). APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, also in a Dragon Capsule carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40. APEX03-2 is also identified by NASA OpNom “TAGES-ISA” (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System—Intracellular Signaling Architecture: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1059.html).Plant lines and plate preparations Four Arabidopsis GFP reporter lines were used in these experiments: pDR5r::GFP, a synthetic auxin response element composed of five AuxRE elements (TAIR line CS9361),24,43 pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, (TAIR line CS16432, AT1G70560),21 pSCR::SCR–GFP (TAIR line CS3999, AT3G54220)22 and pARR5::GFP (TAIR line CS23893, AT3G48100).23 Both spaceflight experiments included pDR5r::GFP; however, pARR5::GFP was limited to CARA, and pTAA1::TAA1–GFP and pSCR::SCR–GFP were limited to APEX03-2. Within each experiment, all genotypes were planted on a single Petri plate designated for imaging (Figure 2d–i). The laboratory preparations and launch conditions were identical for both CARA and APEX03-2. Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5× MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com).24,25 The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 °C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 °C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS. Although the plates were kept refrigerated where possible, the dark treatment ensured dormancy even if the plates were to experience excursions into ambient temperatures.Plant growth conditions on the ISS and comparable ground controls CARA and APEX03-2 were distinctly different experiments, each with unique growth habitats and hardware. However, within each experiment, the environmental conditions of the respective habitats were carefully controlled such that the growth conditions on the ISS closely matched those of their respective ground controls. This was accomplished by running the ground controls discontinuously; a 24-h delay for CARA and a 48-h delay for APEX03-2. These delays enabled the telemetric collection of environmental data from the ISS, which were then used to program the ISS Environmental Simulation (ISSES) chamber at the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2 levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 24 h (or 48 h, respectively). CARA The CARA experiment was designed for the plants to be grown in the low-level, diffuse ambient lighting of the US Lab in the Destiny Module of the ISS. The CARA plates received between 4–6 μmoles/m2/s total light. The plates were configured with Velcro tabs that facilitated attachment to a cloth support that was affixed a wall of the Destiny Module (Figure 2a). The experiment was activated by unwrapping the plates and attaching them to the wall of the module. The exposure to light initiated germination. Five days after germination was initiated, the plate designated for microscopy was removed from the wall by astronaut Steve Swanson, photographed with an SLR camera before imaging (Figure 2g). Ground control plates were mounted on the wall of the ISSES chamber at KSC (Figure 2d).APEX03-2 The APEX03-2 experiment plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS (Figure 2b,c). The 10-cm2 Petri plates were housed perpendicular (“vertical”) to the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. Plants received between 100–135 μmoles/m2/s PAR inside the VPS. Four and eight days after germination was initiated by unwrapping the plates and exposing them light in the VPS, the plate designated for microscopy was removed by the astronaut Butch Wilmore, photographed with an SLR camera before imaging (Figure 2h,i). In the case of APEX03-2, the ground control plates were grown inside the VPS ground unit within the ISSES chamber at KSC (Figure 2e,f).Live imaging on the ISS Live imaging in both the CARA and APEX experiments was conducted with the LMM housed in Destiny Module (Figure 3a), and with the LMM GIU, which is housed at GRC, Cleveland, OH, USA. The LMM on the ISS is a modified Leica RXA microscope adapted for a microgravity environment that is held within the glovebox of the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) to help manage potentially dangerous or liquid-containing payloads within the FIR. Although an astronaut was required for the loading of the sample stage, the microscope is operated telemetrically from GRC by FIR and LMM controllers, who were in turn guided by the authors. In both the CASIS and APEX experiments, the astronaut on duty photographed the seedling-containing Petri plate before loading into the LMM; either by holding in front of the video feed camera (Figure 3b, red arrow), or with a standard SLR camera (Figure 2g–i). The plate was then loaded onto the LMM Petri support base and affixed to the microscope stage (Figure 3c, red arrow). Comparable operations were conducted with the ground control plates (Figure 2d–f). The SLR photographs were used to create root maps to guide the telemetric maneuvers to locate regions of interest on the Petri plates. The image in Figure 3d illustrates how the photograph of the seedlings on the plate was overlaid with the coordinate map for the LMM microscope stage. All operations of the stage in x, y and z were conducted telemetrically by maneuvering the motorized stage through upload of numerical coordinates. The numbers along the periphery of the field of view in Figure 3d define the x and y coordinates. The stage could also be moved in the z direction for focus, and also for the collection of different focal planes. LMM images are collected with a Q-Imaging Retiga 1300 CCD camera (Burnaby, BC, Canada) with a resolution of 1,280×1,024 and 2×2 binning. The white-light images from the LMM were captured using the beam splitter option on the LMM and LMM GIU. GFP fluorescence was visualized using the CHROMA FITC Filter Set: Exciter wavelength 480, Dichroic wavelength 505, and Emitter wavelength 535. The 10× objective (numerical aperture 0.3) was used in CARA, and the 20× objective (numerical aperture 0.4) was used in APEX03-2; these are both “dry” objectives; necessary as the plants were viewed through the lid of the Petri plate. The management and administration of the LMM operations was conducted by the personnel of GRC, particularly through the efforts of teams from ZIN Technologies. The authors oversaw the data collection and drove sample and region of interest selection in real time operations.Imaging of returned samples In the APEX03-2 experiment, a four-day-old imaging plate containing pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP and pSCR::SCR–GFP was harvested to RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA), into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs). KFTs are spaceflight hardware providing three levels of liquid containment for fixing biological samples in space.24,44 After collection, the loaded KFTs were stowed at −80° C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS; ground controls were also collected to KFTs, but were stowed in a standard −80 °C freezer. The samples were kept frozen until the samples were returned to the authors’ laboratory. The preserved plants were then imaged on the ground with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany) in the Cytometry Core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. The roots were prepared by rinsing in distilled water for 2 min, and then either mounted directly in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or counterstained with a 0.1% solution of Calcofluor White for 5 min. Calcofluor White staining was followed by a 5 min wash in distilled water and then mounting in Vectashield for imaging. The imaging parameters for confocal microcopy were kept identical between spaceflight and ground control samples within each genotype, although these parameters could vary among genotypes. For instance: pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, spaceflight and ground, was imaged with the following parameters: exposure 62, pinhole 69, zoom of 1, step size 2.98, line average 2, FC gain of 700 and offset at −3.0. pDR5r::GFP imaging parameters were identical to those used for pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, although the gain was increased for all pDR5r::GFP roots (for both spaceflight and ground) to 760. The 40× oil objective was used throughout, and the 488 laser was kept at 38%. Keeping the imaging parameters constant between spaceflight and ground control samples enabled clear comparisons of the same relative location within the spaceflight and ground roots.Image rendering and quantification LMM and LMM-GIU images are captured as .bmp files. All .bmp files were converted to .tif files using Photoshop. The .tif files were transferred to Volocity 6.3 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for analysis and image presentation. The Fine Filter/Remove Noise function was used to eliminate bad pixels in the GFP images. Images from confocal microscopy of the returned samples were exported as .tif files from the Leica Application Suite. Quantification of fluorescent signal within selected Regions of Interest in confocal imaged samples was calculated using PerkinElmer Volocity 3D Image Analysis Software (Supplementary Figure S1).Acknowledgments This research was supported by NASA NNX12AN69G and CASIS GA-2013-104.

    "title": "Skewing in Arabidopsis roots involves disparate environmental signaling pathways.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5286820/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing.Results This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.Conclusions This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-017-0975-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Transcriptomics, Root skewing, Root waving, Morphometrics, Microarray, Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "introduction": "",
    "methods": "Methods Plants, treatments, and morphometric assays Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild type cultivars Col-0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5% Phytagel and poured in square-gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Seeds were wet sterilized in 1.7 mL Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using a 5-min 70% ethanol wash, followed by a 5 min 50% v/v sodium hypochlorate solution wash (8.3%; Clorox, Oakland, CA), followed by 6 washes with sterile ddH2O. Seeds were planted on plates and moved to 4 °C for 2 days, followed by three days of vertical growth (Agp 90°) in 19 °C +/- 2 °C, and 24-h fluorescent light at approximately 80 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR. Plates were photographed, moved to their respective experimental condition (Agp 45°, 90°, or 135°), and photographed again on day 8 after germination (day 5 after gravistimulation). Plants were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA). Images of 8 day old plates were stacked, aligned, and measured using JFilament plugin for ImageJ [106–108]. Root measurements were processed through a custom R script, available on GitHub [109]. Data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares [110]. Post hoc analysis was conducted using Scheffé’s method. RNA and microarray Roots were dissected from shoots and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five roots were used for each chip, and three chips were used per condition. Lateral roots were not quantified, but did not appear to be significantly different between treatments. Initial RNA concentration was determined by Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Final RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, from which biotin-labeled cRNA was generated using the 3′ IVT plus Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA was purified using magnetic beads and was fragmented. Following fragmentation, cRNA products (12.5 μg) were hybridized with rotation to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Initial data analysis was carried out using the MAS5 algorithm within the Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Microarray Core, University of Florida. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository [GSE83242]. Data processing, comparison tools, and qRT-PCR validation Data were normalized using RMA algorithm using the Limma and Bioconductor packages in R. Differential analyses were processed using R and the Limma package in Bioconductor. Data were imported and organized in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Gene transcripts were significant if absolute value of the fold change was greater than 1 in a base 2 logarithmic scale, as well as a raw p-value cutoff of p < 0.05. All genes meeting these criteria were considered, mitigating the risk of false positives with the benefit of identifying as many genes as possible. False discovery rate (FDR)-correction was performed for further statistical power, with q < 0.05 being indicated in Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3. For comparisons between Col-0 and WS cultivars, genes with altered transcripts in all three growth environments were removed if the change was near the same magnitude, within ± 1 fold change (base 2 log scale). Heatmaps were generated using Gene-E (v. 3.0.204, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Gene data was researched using g:Profiler [89, 90], agriGO [111], ATTED-II [112], Biogrid [113, 114], UniProt [115], KEGG [116, 117], and STRING [118] online databases. Additional visualization of gene networks was created using GeneMANIA [119]. For qRT-PCR validation of transcriptome microarray data, 460 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers used were PAP24 (F: 5’ – ACACGATTGGAGAGAAGGCA – 3’; R: 5’ – AACCAAGGACACGATGAGCT – 3’), SEN1 (F: 5’ – AGGAAATGTTGCAGCAGAGG – 3’; R: 5’ – CGTTGATGGCTCTAGTCGGA – 3’), ASN1 (F: - GGAATATTTGGGGACGGTGC – 3’; R: 5’ – CGGGACATCAAGAACATCGG – 3’), and HKT1 (F: 5’ – TCTTGGAGTGACGGTGCTAG – 3’; R: 5’ – CAGAGGTCCATTCAAAGGCG – 3’). The cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green reagents and was normalized to UBQ11 prior to the internal vertical control comparison or the Col-0 to WS comparison.",
    "results": "Results Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave differently from one another in different growth environments Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where WS demonstrates strong skewing and waving while Col-0 waves like WS but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground (selected references: [14, 17, 49]). These two ecotypes were grown at three growth angles (Agp 45°, 135°, or vertical control of Agp 90°) to produce different root phenotypes (Figs. 1 and 2). Plants were grown for 3 days vertically, then moved to each respective Agp for 5 more days, resulting in steady-state behavior in each of the Agp. Fig. 1.

Vertical arrows indicate comparisons within ecotypes, horizontal arrows indicate comparisons between ecotypes. Eight-day experiment designed to isolate each permutation of root skewing and root waving and identify genes responsible. Vertical comparisons reveal genes responsible for changing the root growth pattern in response to different Agp – for WS, these genes correlate to skewing and waving phenotypes.

Significance cutoffs of |log2(FC)| > 1, p < 0.05Fig. 2. Open in a new tab WS roots grown at Agp 135° skew with reduced waving, while WS roots grown at Agp 45° both skew and wave. Plants were grown vertically for 3 days on 0.5% Phytagel agar media, moved to their respective growth conditions, and grown for 5 more days. Plants were imaged, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater 8 days after germination (5 days after gravistimulation). Bars represent means (average n = 43) and error bars represent 95% confidence interval. Measurements were conducted using ImageJ plugin JFilament [106–108] and were processed using custom R scripts available on GitHub [109]. For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is significant, results of Scheffé’s method are represented with letters. Bars with different letters are different from one another (p < 0.05). For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is not significant, brackets and stars are used in addition to letter codes (p < 0.05 = *). Brackets indicate grouped measurements; all bars for one unit on the x-axis are compared to other bars for other x-axis units, and are represented by the significance indicator above the bracket. a Length of primary root. Roots grown at Agp 90° were the longest, followed by roots grown at Agp 135°, and roots grown at Agp 45° were the shortest. Col-0 roots were shorter than WS roots. b Horizontal growth index of primary root. WS roots skewed more than Col-0 roots when grown at Agp 45° and 135°. c Straightness of primary root. WS roots were less straight than Col-0 roots. d Root wave density. Roots grown at Agp 45° had the highest WD. e Representative image of WS at Agp 45°. f Representative image of Col-0 at Agp 45°. g Representative image of WS at Agp 90°. h Representative image of Col-0 at Agp 90°. i Representative image of WS at Agp 135°. j Representative image of Col-0 at Agp 135°. All images (courtesy of author) were taken through mediaThe first analysis compared transcriptional differences within a ecotype caused by the environmental condition of Agp, specifically differences between WS roots grown at Agp 90° and WS roots grown at Agp 45° or 135°, and the differences between Col-0 roots grown at Agp 90° and Col-0 roots grown at Agp 45° or 135°. Only the Agp influenced the differences in gene expression and root morphology. Roots were quantified following parameters identified in previous work [12, 58] using protocols outlined in the Materials and Methods section. The arrows in Fig. 1 represent comparisons analyzed. Figure 1 also shows a diagram of the root morphology for each genotype under each Agp. The second analysis compared transcriptional differences between ecotypes at each Agp (e.g. differences between Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp 45°). In this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given Agp. The horizontal arrows in Fig. 1 show these comparisons. This matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping approaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. WS roots skew significantly more than Col-0 roots at Agp 135° and significantly more than WS roots at Agp 90° (see Fig. 1). At Agp 45° WS roots skew more than Col-0 roots, but both WS and Col-0 roots also wave at 45°. Quantification of root morphometrics is found in Fig. 2, using horizontal growth index (HGI; trigonometric relationship between the overall angle of growth and length of the root), straightness (STR; straight-line length of the root from start point to end point divided by the actual length of the root), and wave density (WD; waves per millimeter along root length). Comparisons involving Agp 45° allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses. Col-0 roots showed 24 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, most of which may be involved in waving. These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the left column of Fig. 1, with the numbers indicating the number of significantly altered transcripts from each comparison (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)| > 1; p < 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Table 1. Table 1. Comparing different growth angles to vertical within Col-0 Open in a new tabWhen gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp 45° were compared to Agp 90°, 22 genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and 19 of which were downregulated (Fig. 3a). Col-0 plants grown at Agp 45° had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at Agp 90°. Thus these 22 differentially expressed genes were associated with a root waving and but not root skewing. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of transcriptomes as they relate to morphology. Heat maps illustrate differences generated by angle of the growth plate (Agp) or genetic differences. a Genes with altered transcription within Col-0 compared to the control of Agp 90°. Col-0 had 22 gene transcripts altered at Agp 45 ° and 6 altered at Agp 135°. Data in the heat map corresponds with data in Table 1. b Genes with altered transcription within WS compared to the control of Agp 90°. WS had 66 altered gene transcripts at Agp 45° and 40 altered at Agp 135°. Data in heat map corresponds with data in Additional file 1: Table S2. c Transcript comparisons between Col-0 and WS ecotypes – a genetic comparison – with morphological diagrams corresponding to each of the categories (I-VI) of gene expression profile. Transcripts between the ecotypes were removed if they were altered at the same level at all Agp. For example, if the transcript for Gene A was downregulated 2 fold in all conditions, it was removed. This comparison between Col-0 and WS had 128 altered gene transcripts at Agp 90°, 88 altered between Col-0 and WS at Agp 45°, and 133 altered between Col-0 and WS at Agp 135°. Data in heat map corresponds to data in Additional file 2: Table S3.Comparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp 135° with profiles of roots grown at Agp 90° (Fig. 3a), revealed only 6 genes that were differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. All 6 of these genes were downregulated. Morphologically, Col-0 roots grown at Agp 135° were not significantly different from those grown at Agp 90° (Fig. 2). Four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the Agp 45° comparison to Agp 90°, with just 2 being unique (At1g09310; a protein of unknown function with DUF538 and At3g19430; a protein related to late-embryogenesis abundant proteins, Table 1). Thus the 18 genes unique to the Agp 45° comparison to their 90° controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. Many different processes were associated with these 18 genes identified, such as cell wall structure (XTH7, XTH9) and sugar transport (SWEET11, OCT1; Table 1). Only four genes had altered transcript levels at both Agp 45° and 135°, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments (Fig. 3a). All four of these genes were downregulated at approximately the same levels in both conditions. These genes were At4g12490 (a pEARLI1-like LTP), THIOREDOXIN H8 (TRX8; At1g69880), DEFECTIVE IN INDUCED RESISTANCE 1 (DIR1; At5g48485; putative LTP), and CELL WALL INVERTASE 5 (ATCWINV5; At3g13784). WS showed 92 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, revealing candidates genes involved in skewing These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the right column of Fig. 1. The number of genes with significantly altered transcripts is located next to the appropriate arrow in Fig. 1 (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)| > 1; p < 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Additional file 1: Table S2. At Agp 45°, WS produces roots that both skew and wave compared to the roots grown vertically (Agp 90°). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS that were grown at Agp 45° had 66 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to Agp 90°. Nine of the 66 genes were upregulated, while 57 were downregulated (Fig. 3b and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes may represent those involved in both skewing and waving processes. Processes associated with these genes include lipid transfer (AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 [AZI1; At4g12470], CELL WALL-PLASMA MEMBRANE LINKER PROTEIN [CWLP; At3g22120]), pectin methylesterase inhibition (At5g62330, At2g01610), and peroxidase activity (PEROXIDASE 49 [PER49; At4g36430], PEROXIDASE 53 [PER53; At5g06720]; Additional file 1: Table S2). When grown at Agp 135° WS produces roots that skew without waving (Fig. 2). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS roots grown at Agp 135° had 40 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp 90°. These 40 genes are likely skewing-related (Fig. 3b). Only two genes (HISTONE H1-3 [HIS1-3; At2g18050] and DARK INDUCIBLE 2 [DIN2; At3g60140]) also had differential transcription in Col-0, and the expression level of DIN2 was in opposite directions (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). Some of the processes included are methionine metabolism related (METHIONINE GAMMA-LYASE [MGL; At1g64660]), histone-related (HIS1-3), and jacalin-related (JACALIN-RELATED LECTIN 40 [JAL40; At5g28520]). Other genes from these 40 will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. The genes with altered transcription in both Agp 45° and at Agp 135° (14 out of the 40 genes previously mentioned) were altered in the same way in both Agp 45° and 135° compared to Agp 90°, except for one gene. This one gene was ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE [GLUTAMINE-HYDROLYZING] 1 (ASN1; At3g47340, also called DIN6,), which was downregulated in Agp 45° and upregulated in Agp 135°, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. The remaining 13 genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization (XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 9 [XTH9; At4g03210]) and sugar transport (SWEET11 and SWEET12; At3g48740 and At5g23660, respectively). Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed genes that could be involved in skewing in WS The gene expression profiles between Col-0 and WS when skewing and waving were also compared. These comparisons are represented in Fig. 1 by the horizontal arrows pointing toward WS, with the number of significantly altered levels of gene transcripts indicated above each arrow. Genes altered between Col-0 and WS at the same level in all three growth angles were removed from the comparison, as they represent inherent differences between the cultivars that were independent of the testing environments.

The left circle represents total number of genes changed in WS (Fig. 3b) and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between Col-0 and WS in groups IV, V, and VI (Fig. 3c). b Genes with altered transcription identified in Fig. 3b (left column) were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups IV, V, and VI of Fig. 3c (right column), resulting in 16 genes. The majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with Agp 135° – a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving – totaling 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC), shown here in bolded text with dark connecting linesThe first differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col-0 and WS only when grown Agp 90°. Genes 1–61 had altered transcript levels in Category I (Fig. 3c); 19 of the identified genes were upregulated and 42 of which were downregulated (Additional file 2: Table S3). This pattern indicated inherent genetic differences between these two lines in their control condition and these differences were mitigated or no longer present in other tested growth environments. The second differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col-0 and WS when cultivars grown Agp 90°, but also had altered transcripts in a same way when grown at Agp 45°. Genes 62–85 had altered transcript levels in Category II (Fig. 3c); 15 of the identified genes were upregulated and 9 downregulated when comparing the gene expression in Col-0 to WS roots (Additional file 2: Table S3). This expression pattern was not considered to be involved with skewing, since Agp 45° results in a combination of skewing and waving in WS and waving in Col-0. Additionally, the genes identified in this expression pattern were not significantly different in Agp 135°, which generates skewing without waving in WS and a non-skewing, non-waving phenotype in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The third expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS when grown Agp 90° and at Agp 135°. Genes 86–128 had altered transcript levels in Category III (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 23 genes downregulated when comparing Col-0 to WS (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). At Agp 135° WS skewed and Col-0 did not, yet these genes showed same differential expression between Col-0 and WS roots when grown at Agp 90° and do not exhibit any skewing or waving differences (Figs. 2 and 3c). These genes were likely not involved with skewing. The fourth expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS only when both were grown at Agp 45°. Genes 129–166 had altered transcript levels in Category IV (Fig. 3c); 30 of the identified genes were upregulated and 8 were downregulated (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes identified represent a combination of skewing and waving phenomena, and as such, were considered as potential root skewing candidates. The fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both Agp 45° and 135° when comparing Col-0 roots to WS roots. Genes 167–192 had altered transcript levels in Category V (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig. 3c). Skewing occurred in WS but not in Col-0 in both conditions (Fig. 2), although at Agp 45°, skewing occurred with waving. For WS roots, skewing was a distinguished morphological phenotype from Col-0. The genes identified had altered transcript levels in both Agp 45° and 135°, and are therefore likely involved with skewing. The sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at Agp 135° only, when comparing Col-0 to WS. Genes 193–256 had altered transcript levels in Category VI (Fig. 3c); 14 of the identified genes were upregulated and 50 genes were downregulated, meaning that WS had higher levels of these 50 genes when compared to Col-0. These identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in WS at Agp 135° with minimal waving but it does not in Col-0, thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two ecotypes (Fig. 2). The genes from the fifth and the sixth expression patterns, totaling 90 genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes. Overlap of skew gene candidates from all comparisons further narrows the set of skew gene candidates When combining the lists of genes identified in Categories IV, V, and VI (128 genes) with genes identified within WS comparisons (66 genes altered at Agp 45° and 40 genes altered at Agp 135°), 16 genes are shared (Fig. 4). This overlap is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 4a. The majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved Agp 135° – the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving – resulting in 11 genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC, Table 2; also indicated by “Y*” in Additional file 1: Table S2). Several of the HPSGC have been verified with qRT-PCR, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data [see Additional file 3]. The HPSGC are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Additionally, only 3 of these 11 genes were shared with the set of genes identified in Col-0 grown at Agp 45°, which induced root waving (Fig. 3a, Table 1). Two of these genes (DIN2 and ASN1) were expressed in opposite directions, while the remaining gene (SWEET11) was upregulated in all sets. Table 2.

    "discussion": "Discussion Transcriptome comparisons within ecotypes reveal a primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing The primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing was identified by comparing the transcription of WS genes when grown at Agp 45° or 135° compared to Agp 90°. Morphologically, WS roots skew when grown at Agp 135° with reduced waving (Figs. 1 and 2). The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of Agp 135° to Agp 90° represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at Agp 45°; however, the occurrence of waving at Agp 45° complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at Agp 45°. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. As seen in Table 2, the 11 genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality. Col-0 roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did WS roots, and as such, differed only in waving when Agp 45° or 135° were compared to Agp 90°. The number of genes with altered transcription at Agp 45° or 135° compared to Agp 90° was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology. Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of 128 genes that may be involved in skewing Comparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col-0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. In order to determine which gene expression patterns are related to skewing, the relative expression patterns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles. Categories I-III in Fig. 3c are not related to skewing. The first category (Category I, Genes 1–61; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were different between WS and Col-0 at Agp 90° and also unchanged at Agp 45° or 135° (Additional file 2: Table S3). The second category (Category II, Genes 62–85; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contained genes that were differentially expressed between WS and Col-0 at Agp 45°. However, the transcript expression of these genes was also different when the roots did not skew at Agp 90, which suggests that these genes are responding to growth angle but are not responsible for causing the morphologic change. The same logic can be applied to the genes of Category III, where transcript expression was different between WS and Col-0 when grown at Agp 90° and when grown at Agp 135° (Category III, Genes 86–128; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes of Category IV present a pattern of expression that indicated a potential role in skewing (Category IV; Genes 129–166; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3), since the genes present in this category are differentially expressed between WS (which skews at Agp 45°) and Col-0 (which does not skew). Some of the genes identified in this category include HIS1-3, SKU5 SIMILAR 15 (SKS15; At4g37160; involved in oxidoreductase activity and copper ion binding), and XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 26 (XTH26; At4g28850; involved in hydrolase activity and cell wall remodeling). SKS15 is related to a known SKU gene (SKU5), which is also known to have substantial impact on root growth and morphology [56]. Protein products of XTH26 reduce cell wall elongation in roots with altered root hair morphology [59], which may also impact the overall directionality or skewing of the root. The second category of genes whose differential expression between WS and Col-0 indicated a role in skewing (Category V; Genes 167–192; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between the ecotypes at both Agp 45° and 135. The transcription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles (Fig. 2), it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology (Additional file 2: Table S3). A couple of the genes identified include MODIFIER OF SNC1 2 (MOS2; At1g33520; where SNC1 is SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE and NPR1-1 is NONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1; At4g16890 and At1g64280, respectively) and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BEL10; At1g19700, where BEL1 is a homeodomain transcription factor controlling ovule patterning; At5g41410). MOS2 is a DNA-binding gene that plays a role in the immune response pathway and in microRNA (miRNA) maturation [60]. miRNAs are heavily involved in gene regulation [61]. Since Col-0 roots have higher transcript levels of MOS2 at both Agp 45° and 135° than WS, it is possible that miRNAs are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth parallel with gravity. The lower levels of MOS2 in WS roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing. BEL10 was upregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp 45° or 135° (Additional file 2: Table S3). BEL10 is a transcription factor that interacts with PLP, a blue light receptor also involved in response to salt or dehydration stresses [62]. Higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phosphate signaling pathways [36]. Additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redundant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth [63], which may, in turn, alter overall root directionality and impact skewing. The third category of genes that indicated a role in skewing (Category VI; Genes 193–256; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS when roots were grown at Agp 135°. Since WS roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at Agp 90°, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. Some of the genes in this category include RESPONSIVE TO ABA 18 (RAB18; At5g66400) and PINOID BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1; At5g54490; Additional file 2: Table S3). RAB18 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. This dehydrin-related protein is reduced after exogenous 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) application, meaning it responds directly to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid (ABA) [64]. PBP1 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. Since this PINOID-binding protein is upregulated by auxin [65], the different PBP1 levels between Col-0 and WS could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes [65, 66]. Additional genes identified in Category VI will be discussed in the following section, due to their overlap with previously identified skew gene candidates. Eleven genes remaining across all sets are most likely to be involved in skewing in various processes A subset of most likely candidate genes was identified by the intersection of the list based on growth angle in WS and the list based on comparative gene expression between WS and Col-0 (Fig. 4), with the overlap of the two lists indicated in the Venn diagram, found in Fig. 4a. The list of 92 genes based on growth angle of WS (Fig. 4b; left heat map labeled “Physiology”) was compared to the list of 128 genes identified between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 4b; right heat map labeled “Genotype”), producing 16 genes that appear in both lists (Fig. 4a and b; Y* in both Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3). The majority of these 16 genes are found involving Agp 135°, shown in bold text and dark lines. Agp 135° was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in WS, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this Agp provides more support for their involvement in root skewing. These 11 genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC). The 11 HPSGC are involved in many different processes and were subjected to a thorough literature and expression map search using many available databases, such as Suba3, TAIR, and the Arabidopsis eFP browser [67–71]. These genes were searched with the goal of finding associations with cell expansion, division, auxin transport, or any process involved with root tropisms, so as to develop insights into their roles in skewing. Sub-organ localizations (e.g. columella cells, root tip, root hairs, etc.) were noted where possible. A summary of these results is found in Table 2. MIOX4 is expressed in root hairs, stele, and lateral root cap [71], and digested columella cells have lower transcript abundance in response to auxin [70]. Additionally, overexpression of MIOX4 in the presence of l-Ascorbic acid have increased root growth [72]. MIOX4 influences root growth responses during stressed conditions [73], but knockouts do not have abnormal cell walls, despite the role of MIOX4 upstream of polysaccharide integration into the cell wall [74]. PAP24 is not highly expressed in any root zones [69–71], but is predicted to be in plant cell walls and to have acid phosphatase and metal ion binding activity [67]. ASN1 is expressed in root hairs [71] and in the root under phosphate starvation [75]. ASN1 is also responsive to darkness and sucrose starvation, and may have a role in response to viral infections [76]. At2g25150 is highly expressed in the cortex under normal conditions [71], but is not shown to be auxin responsive [70]. In the literature, At2g25150 is described to have a product that is a BAHD enzyme with spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase activity in roots [77] and is upregulated by cytokinin activity [78], which is evidence for its activity in cell division [77]. SIS is not significantly expressed in roots under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the columella cells, root cap, and epidermis of Arabidopsis roots after 1 h of salt stress [79] and 1 hour at low pH [80]. SIS is also known to be involved in salt tolerance [67]. At5g66780 is not expressed in the root under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the root tip at low pH levels and under salt stress [74, 80]. Under normal conditions, At5g66780 is expressed in all zones along the root epidermis, though not contiguously [71]. This gene is unknown; no other published information exists on this gene. At3g28310 is expressed in the procambium of the root in the elongation zone [69, 71]. This gene produces a hypothetical protein with DUF677 [67] and is not well studied. DIN2 is not expressed in the root under normal condtions, but is upregulated in roots under salt stress [79] and in conditions lacking inorganic phosphate [75]. DIN2 mRNA can be transported from cell to cell [81], and is involved in a process that can lead to weakened root cell walls when under salt stress [82]. SEN1 is expressed in mature and developing root hairs [71], and is downregulated in the presence of auxin [70]. SEN1 is regulated by both methyl-jasmonate and salicylic acid [83], and strongly induced by phosphate starvation [84],. Knockout mutants are growth deficient in the light [67]. SWEET11 is present in the vasculature in the zone of maturation [71], and is downregulated in the cortex of sulfur-deficient roots after 24 h [80]. SWEET11 is a known sucrose efflux transporter that can assist with carbon transport to the roots in times of water stress [85]. HKT1 is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in Arabidopsis roots [69, 71], and is linked to salt and water stress responses [86]. Knockout hkt1 has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress [86]. HKT1 is also regulated by cytokinin [87], and has a close interaction with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4; At2g40220), where both gene products are expressed in the same cells and ABI4 binds to sites in the HKT1 promoter [88]. The 11 HPSGC show similar expression patterns in that none are particularly expressed in the root tip versus the rest of the root and are all closely related into one co-expression and co-localization network (Fig. 5), despite being members of disparate signaling pathways and potential activities (Table 2). These different signaling and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their individual gene members. For example, ASN1, SWEET11, and HKT1 are involved in sucrose response, sugar transport, and salt signaling, respectively. These three genes, which are not co-expressed or co-localized with one another, are all co-expressed with a common gene (SWEET12; Fig. 5), which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. Other HPSGC are involved with more downstream processes. DIN2 and SIS are involved in two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co-localized with one another, and are both co-localized with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 9 (ADF9; At4g34970) and PLANT INVERTASE/PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 47 (PME47; At5g04970; Fig. 5), both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling. Other genes pulled in by this co-expression and co-localization network are related to handling sugar signaling downstream of sensing, such as SUGAR TRANSPORTER 1 (STP1; At1g11260) and LIKE SEX4 1 (LSF1; At3g01510, where SEX4 is a plant-specific glucan phosphatase; Fig. 5). An additional network file shows the relationship between HPSGC and these additional genes [see Additional file 4]. This computational approach to the HPSGC illustrates possibilities for how these environmental sensing and signaling pathway genes could be involved in the generation of root skewing. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Co-expression and co-localization network of HPSGC shows each member is linked with others. Additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. Network generated with GeneMANIA [119]Sugar signaling is a major signaling pathway identified in the skew gene candidates. Sucrose efflux transporters SWEET11 and SWEET12 were both upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 45° and 135°. SWEET11, a member of the HPSGC, was also upregulated in Col-0 roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes are also associated with response to salt stress, divalent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomembrane system [89, 90]. SWEET11 and SWEET12 are shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast [91], with SWEET12 responding to CO2 as well [92]. This sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other members of the MtN3/saliva/SWEET-family of genes are involved with ion transport and physiological process regulation [93]. Root exudates are also involved in regulation of the surrounding microbiome and microenvironment [94], and these SWEET efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. Additionally, ASN1 was upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 135° and was downregulated in both Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). ASN1 responds to sucrose starvation, and mRNA accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests [95, 96]. Additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be involved in light/sugar signaling pathways (Additional file 1: Table S2). It is possible that ASN1 would be involved with the aforementioned SWEET family network. Both DIN2 and ASN1 were upregulated in the presence of various heavy metals, further implicating their roles in environmental signaling pathways [97], with ASN1 being expressed in the elongation and maturation zones in the root [71]. Other genes in the HPSGC are involved in sugar signaling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways. DIN2 is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starvation [96, 98]. DIN2 transcript is increased in the absence of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases [96]. Though technically a metallo-phosphoesterase and a type 5 acid phosphatase, PAP24 is a member of the HPSGC and may be involved in similar signaling pathways [99]. MIOX4 is suppressed in the shoot by exogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through InsP3 signaling cascades [73], which itself plays a role in response to gravitropic stimuli [100]. SEN1 is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor [101]. SEN1 itself may provide a link between glucose signaling and phosphate signaling [101], and is highly expressed in the meristematic zone of the root [71]. Salt signaling is another functional group identified in the HPSGC. HKT1 has a role in salt signaling in Arabidopsis roots [102], and is likely involved in loading sodium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations [86]. HKT1 activity is reduced by high calcium levels [103, 104], which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways. SIS also has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time [105]. Some of these salt-related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. For example, DIN2 is present in the columella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, while SIS is present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis [79].",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions This work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non-skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing.",

Copyright notice ID: 5286820 PMID: 28143395 Abstract Background Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing.Results This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.Conclusions This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-017-0975-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Transcriptomics, Root skewing, Root waving, Morphometrics, Microarray, Arabidopsis thalianaBackground Plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level [1–6]. The work presented here seeks further insights into root growth strategies by focusing on two distinct growth patterns of root growth, skewing and waving. Skewing is when the steady-state growth direction of a root deviates from the direction of the gravity vector and waving is when the root undulates back and forth over time along its direction of growth [7–14]. Skewing and waving have been described as gravity-enhanced touch responses, since these root patterns are notably present when a plant is grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. Current models require that gravity pulls the root tip down onto the tilted surface, which increases the mechanical impedance to growth, and results in root skewing and root waving [15]. However, recent spaceflight experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that certain ecotypes have roots that deviate from vertical growth (at a magnitude similar to skewing on the ground) and wave in the absence of gravity [16–18]. These ecotypes that exhibit spaceflight skewing are also the ecotypes that exhibit terrestrial skewing when grown at an angle [16–18]. The degree of skewing in spaceflight was consistent with previous terrestrial observations, but the waving pattern was different from what was typically observed on the ground [17]. The causes of skewing – and subsequently, the genes involved – are currently unknown. The goal of this study is to discover which genes are associated with root skewing through transcription microarrays. Other root tropisms exist as a result of environmental interaction, which likely impact the degree of root skewing and root waving. Touch responses, or thigmotropism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns [11, 19–28]. Plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle (GSA), which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ [29]. GSA is driven by auxin and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB)-dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism [30–32]. Light can alter GSA for different plant systems [33], and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction [34–42]. Additional tropisms include halotropism [39, 43, 44], chemotropism [45], hydrotropism [46], all of which can alter root growth response (reviewed in [3]). Many hypotheses exist for the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes responsible for root skewing and root waving. As a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth patterns. Hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving [10] and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving [47, 48]. The cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving [7, 18, 49, 50], including WAVE-DAMPENED 2 (WVD2; At5g28646) and WVD2-LIKE 1 (WDL1; At3g04630) genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization [51]. Many genes involved in molecular patterning, signaling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins [11], cell expansion gene ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD3; At3g13870) with putative GTP-binding motif [13], CLAVATA-related genes [52], protein phosphatase/PP2A ENHANCED ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (RCN1; At1g25490; [53]), serine/threonine protein kinases WAG1 and WAG2 (At1g53700 and At3g14370, respectively; [54]), and KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KNAT1; At4g08150; [55]) are all associated with morphological change in root skewing or root waving. The SKU family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, with SKU5 (At4g12420) and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth [56] and SKU6 (At2g03680) and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion [50]. While no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skewing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved. Skewing and waving are functionally separable using genetics [7, 12, 13, 51, 57]. The physiological separation of skewing from waving within a ecotype can be accomplished by using the environment, particularly the tilt angle of the growth plate, and can also occur in spaceflight [16–18]. The degree to which growth plates are tilted is referred to as the Angle of the growth plate (Agp). Typically, plates are tilted backward such that plants are above the media surface, at Agp 45°. For many Arabidopsis ecotypes, growth at Agp 45° results in roots that both skew and wave. When growth plates are tilted forward, such that plants are below the media surface, at Agp 135°, Arabidopsis roots skew with reduced waving, similar to the pattern observed in spaceflight. Growth plates held vertically are Agp 90° and are considered as the controls for growth angle, as roots on vertical plates generally do not skew or wave. This study aims to discover additional genes associated with root skewing through transcription microarray analyses of Arabidopsis roots exhibiting different patterns of waving and skewing. Gene expression profiles were derived from Arabidopsis that displayed different root growth behaviors in various growth environments in order to identify gene activities associated with skewing and waving. Identified genes were validated using qRT-PCR and evaluated using previous studies for likelihood of involvement with the skewing process.Results Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave differently from one another in different growth environments Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where WS demonstrates strong skewing and waving while Col-0 waves like WS but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground (selected references: [14, 17, 49]). These two ecotypes were grown at three growth angles (Agp 45°, 135°, or vertical control of Agp 90°) to produce different root phenotypes (Figs. 1 and 2). Plants were grown for 3 days vertically, then moved to each respective Agp for 5 more days, resulting in steady-state behavior in each of the Agp. Fig. 1.

Vertical arrows indicate comparisons within ecotypes, horizontal arrows indicate comparisons between ecotypes. Eight-day experiment designed to isolate each permutation of root skewing and root waving and identify genes responsible. Vertical comparisons reveal genes responsible for changing the root growth pattern in response to different Agp – for WS, these genes correlate to skewing and waving phenotypes. Horizontal comparisons reveal genes responsible for differences in skewing and waving for Col-0 and WS roots. Numbers indicate gene transcripts with different levels of transcripts from controls. Significance cutoffs of |log2(FC)| > 1, p < 0.05Fig. 2. Open in a new tab WS roots grown at Agp 135° skew with reduced waving, while WS roots grown at Agp 45° both skew and wave. Plants were grown vertically for 3 days on 0.5% Phytagel agar media, moved to their respective growth conditions, and grown for 5 more days. Plants were imaged, harvested, and fixed in RNAlater 8 days after germination (5 days after gravistimulation). Bars represent means (average n = 43) and error bars represent 95% confidence interval. Measurements were conducted using ImageJ plugin JFilament [106–108] and were processed using custom R scripts available on GitHub [109]. For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is significant, results of Scheffé’s method are represented with letters. Bars with different letters are different from one another (p < 0.05). For comparisons where interaction of the two independent variables is not significant, brackets and stars are used in addition to letter codes (p < 0.05 = *). Brackets indicate grouped measurements; all bars for one unit on the x-axis are compared to other bars for other x-axis units, and are represented by the significance indicator above the bracket. a Length of primary root. Roots grown at Agp 90° were the longest, followed by roots grown at Agp 135°, and roots grown at Agp 45° were the shortest.

All images (courtesy of author) were taken through mediaThe first analysis compared transcriptional differences within a ecotype caused by the environmental condition of Agp, specifically differences between WS roots grown at Agp 90° and WS roots grown at Agp 45° or 135°, and the differences between Col-0 roots grown at Agp 90° and Col-0 roots grown at Agp 45° or 135°. Only the Agp influenced the differences in gene expression and root morphology. Roots were quantified following parameters identified in previous work [12, 58] using protocols outlined in the Materials and Methods section. The arrows in Fig. 1 represent comparisons analyzed. Figure 1 also shows a diagram of the root morphology for each genotype under each Agp. The second analysis compared transcriptional differences between ecotypes at each Agp (e.g. differences between Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp 45°). In this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given Agp. The horizontal arrows in Fig. 1 show these comparisons. This matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping approaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. WS roots skew significantly more than Col-0 roots at Agp 135° and significantly more than WS roots at Agp 90° (see Fig. 1). At Agp 45° WS roots skew more than Col-0 roots, but both WS and Col-0 roots also wave at 45°. Quantification of root morphometrics is found in Fig. 2, using horizontal growth index (HGI; trigonometric relationship between the overall angle of growth and length of the root), straightness (STR; straight-line length of the root from start point to end point divided by the actual length of the root), and wave density (WD; waves per millimeter along root length). Comparisons involving Agp 45° allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses.Col-0 roots showed 24 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, most of which may be involved in waving. These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the left column of Fig. 1, with the numbers indicating the number of significantly altered transcripts from each comparison (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)| > 1; p < 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Table 1. Table 1. Comparing different growth angles to vertical within Col-0 Open in a new tabWhen gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp 45° were compared to Agp 90°, 22 genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and 19 of which were downregulated (Fig. 3a). Col-0 plants grown at Agp 45° had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at Agp 90°. Thus these 22 differentially expressed genes were associated with a root waving and but not root skewing. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of transcriptomes as they relate to morphology. Heat maps illustrate differences generated by angle of the growth plate (Agp) or genetic differences. a Genes with altered transcription within Col-0 compared to the control of Agp 90°. Col-0 had 22 gene transcripts altered at Agp 45 ° and 6 altered at Agp 135°. Data in the heat map corresponds with data in Table 1. b Genes with altered transcription within WS compared to the control of Agp 90°. WS had 66 altered gene transcripts at Agp 45° and 40 altered at Agp 135°. Data in heat map corresponds with data in Additional file 1: Table S2. c Transcript comparisons between Col-0 and WS ecotypes – a genetic comparison – with morphological diagrams corresponding to each of the categories (I-VI) of gene expression profile. Transcripts between the ecotypes were removed if they were altered at the same level at all Agp. For example, if the transcript for Gene A was downregulated 2 fold in all conditions, it was removed. This comparison between Col-0 and WS had 128 altered gene transcripts at Agp 90°, 88 altered between Col-0 and WS at Agp 45°, and 133 altered between Col-0 and WS at Agp 135°. Data in heat map corresponds to data in Additional file 2: Table S3.Comparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp 135° with profiles of roots grown at Agp 90° (Fig. 3a), revealed only 6 genes that were differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. All 6 of these genes were downregulated. Morphologically, Col-0 roots grown at Agp 135° were not significantly different from those grown at Agp 90° (Fig. 2). Four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the Agp 45° comparison to Agp 90°, with just 2 being unique (At1g09310; a protein of unknown function with DUF538 and At3g19430; a protein related to late-embryogenesis abundant proteins, Table 1). Thus the 18 genes unique to the Agp 45° comparison to their 90° controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. Many different processes were associated with these 18 genes identified, such as cell wall structure (XTH7, XTH9) and sugar transport (SWEET11, OCT1; Table 1). Only four genes had altered transcript levels at both Agp 45° and 135°, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments (Fig. 3a). All four of these genes were downregulated at approximately the same levels in both conditions. These genes were At4g12490 (a pEARLI1-like LTP), THIOREDOXIN H8 (TRX8; At1g69880), DEFECTIVE IN INDUCED RESISTANCE 1 (DIR1; At5g48485; putative LTP), and CELL WALL INVERTASE 5 (ATCWINV5; At3g13784).WS showed 92 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, revealing candidates genes involved in skewing These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the right column of Fig. 1. The number of genes with significantly altered transcripts is located next to the appropriate arrow in Fig. 1 (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)| > 1; p < 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Additional file 1: Table S2. At Agp 45°, WS produces roots that both skew and wave compared to the roots grown vertically (Agp 90°). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS that were grown at Agp 45° had 66 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to Agp 90°. Nine of the 66 genes were upregulated, while 57 were downregulated (Fig. 3b and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes may represent those involved in both skewing and waving processes. Processes associated with these genes include lipid transfer (AZELAIC ACID INDUCED 1 [AZI1; At4g12470], CELL WALL-PLASMA MEMBRANE LINKER PROTEIN [CWLP; At3g22120]), pectin methylesterase inhibition (At5g62330, At2g01610), and peroxidase activity (PEROXIDASE 49 [PER49; At4g36430], PEROXIDASE 53 [PER53; At5g06720]; Additional file 1: Table S2). When grown at Agp 135° WS produces roots that skew without waving (Fig. 2). Gene expression profiles revealed that WS roots grown at Agp 135° had 40 genes with altered transcription in roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp 90°. These 40 genes are likely skewing-related (Fig. 3b). Only two genes (HISTONE H1-3 [HIS1-3; At2g18050] and DARK INDUCIBLE 2 [DIN2; At3g60140]) also had differential transcription in Col-0, and the expression level of DIN2 was in opposite directions (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). Some of the processes included are methionine metabolism related (METHIONINE GAMMA-LYASE [MGL; At1g64660]), histone-related (HIS1-3), and jacalin-related (JACALIN-RELATED LECTIN 40 [JAL40; At5g28520]). Other genes from these 40 will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. The genes with altered transcription in both Agp 45° and at Agp 135° (14 out of the 40 genes previously mentioned) were altered in the same way in both Agp 45° and 135° compared to Agp 90°, except for one gene. This one gene was ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE [GLUTAMINE-HYDROLYZING] 1 (ASN1; At3g47340, also called DIN6,), which was downregulated in Agp 45° and upregulated in Agp 135°, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. The remaining 13 genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization (XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 9 [XTH9; At4g03210]) and sugar transport (SWEET11 and SWEET12; At3g48740 and At5g23660, respectively).Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed genes that could be involved in skewing in WS The gene expression profiles between Col-0 and WS when skewing and waving were also compared. These comparisons are represented in Fig. 1 by the horizontal arrows pointing toward WS, with the number of significantly altered levels of gene transcripts indicated above each arrow. Genes altered between Col-0 and WS at the same level in all three growth angles were removed from the comparison, as they represent inherent differences between the cultivars that were independent of the testing environments. The plant images and morphometrics are found in Fig. 2, with resulting heat map with six different patterns of expression pattern categories in Fig. 4 and gene annotations, information, and significance cutoffs in Additional file 2: Table S3. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of candidate skew genes from physiological and genotypic comparisons. a Venn diagram of gene numbers from Fig. 3, illustrating overlap of 16 genes. The left circle represents total number of genes changed in WS (Fig. 3b) and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between Col-0 and WS in groups IV, V, and VI (Fig. 3c). b Genes with altered transcription identified in Fig. 3b (left column) were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups IV, V, and VI of Fig. 3c (right column), resulting in 16 genes. The majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with Agp 135° – a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving – totaling 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC), shown here in bolded text with dark connecting linesThe first differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col-0 and WS only when grown Agp 90°. Genes 1–61 had altered transcript levels in Category I (Fig. 3c); 19 of the identified genes were upregulated and 42 of which were downregulated (Additional file 2: Table S3). This pattern indicated inherent genetic differences between these two lines in their control condition and these differences were mitigated or no longer present in other tested growth environments. The second differential gene expression pattern had altered transcripts between Col-0 and WS when cultivars grown Agp 90°, but also had altered transcripts in a same way when grown at Agp 45°. Genes 62–85 had altered transcript levels in Category II (Fig. 3c); 15 of the identified genes were upregulated and 9 downregulated when comparing the gene expression in Col-0 to WS roots (Additional file 2: Table S3). This expression pattern was not considered to be involved with skewing, since Agp 45° results in a combination of skewing and waving in WS and waving in Col-0. Additionally, the genes identified in this expression pattern were not significantly different in Agp 135°, which generates skewing without waving in WS and a non-skewing, non-waving phenotype in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The third expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS when grown Agp 90° and at Agp 135°. Genes 86–128 had altered transcript levels in Category III (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 23 genes downregulated when comparing Col-0 to WS (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). At Agp 135° WS skewed and Col-0 did not, yet these genes showed same differential expression between Col-0 and WS roots when grown at Agp 90° and do not exhibit any skewing or waving differences (Figs. 2 and 3c). These genes were likely not involved with skewing. The fourth expression pattern had altered transcript levels between Col-0 and WS only when both were grown at Agp 45°. Genes 129–166 had altered transcript levels in Category IV (Fig. 3c); 30 of the identified genes were upregulated and 8 were downregulated (Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes identified represent a combination of skewing and waving phenomena, and as such, were considered as potential root skewing candidates. The fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both Agp 45° and 135° when comparing Col-0 roots to WS roots. Genes 167–192 had altered transcript levels in Category V (Fig. 3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig. 3c). Skewing occurred in WS but not in Col-0 in both conditions (Fig. 2), although at Agp 45°, skewing occurred with waving. For WS roots, skewing was a distinguished morphological phenotype from Col-0. The genes identified had altered transcript levels in both Agp 45° and 135°, and are therefore likely involved with skewing. The sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at Agp 135° only, when comparing Col-0 to WS. Genes 193–256 had altered transcript levels in Category VI (Fig. 3c); 14 of the identified genes were upregulated and 50 genes were downregulated, meaning that WS had higher levels of these 50 genes when compared to Col-0. These identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in WS at Agp 135° with minimal waving but it does not in Col-0, thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two ecotypes (Fig. 2). The genes from the fifth and the sixth expression patterns, totaling 90 genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes.Overlap of skew gene candidates from all comparisons further narrows the set of skew gene candidates When combining the lists of genes identified in Categories IV, V, and VI (128 genes) with genes identified within WS comparisons (66 genes altered at Agp 45° and 40 genes altered at Agp 135°), 16 genes are shared (Fig. 4). This overlap is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 4a. The majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved Agp 135° – the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving – resulting in 11 genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC, Table 2; also indicated by “Y*” in Additional file 1: Table S2). Several of the HPSGC have been verified with qRT-PCR, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data [see Additional file 3]. The HPSGC are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Additionally, only 3 of these 11 genes were shared with the set of genes identified in Col-0 grown at Agp 45°, which induced root waving (Fig. 3a, Table 1). Two of these genes (DIN2 and ASN1) were expressed in opposite directions, while the remaining gene (SWEET11) was upregulated in all sets. Table 2.

Morphologically, WS roots skew when grown at Agp 135° with reduced waving (Figs. 1 and 2). The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of Agp 135° to Agp 90° represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at Agp 45°; however, the occurrence of waving at Agp 45° complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at Agp 45°. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. As seen in Table 2, the 11 genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality. Col-0 roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did WS roots, and as such, differed only in waving when Agp 45° or 135° were compared to Agp 90°. The number of genes with altered transcription at Agp 45° or 135° compared to Agp 90° was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology.Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of 128 genes that may be involved in skewing Comparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col-0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. In order to determine which gene expression patterns are related to skewing, the relative expression patterns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles. Categories I-III in Fig. 3c are not related to skewing. The first category (Category I, Genes 1–61; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were different between WS and Col-0 at Agp 90° and also unchanged at Agp 45° or 135° (Additional file 2: Table S3). The second category (Category II, Genes 62–85; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contained genes that were differentially expressed between WS and Col-0 at Agp 45°. However, the transcript expression of these genes was also different when the roots did not skew at Agp 90, which suggests that these genes are responding to growth angle but are not responsible for causing the morphologic change. The same logic can be applied to the genes of Category III, where transcript expression was different between WS and Col-0 when grown at Agp 90° and when grown at Agp 135° (Category III, Genes 86–128; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3). The genes of Category IV present a pattern of expression that indicated a potential role in skewing (Category IV; Genes 129–166; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3), since the genes present in this category are differentially expressed between WS (which skews at Agp 45°) and Col-0 (which does not skew). Some of the genes identified in this category include HIS1-3, SKU5 SIMILAR 15 (SKS15; At4g37160; involved in oxidoreductase activity and copper ion binding), and XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 26 (XTH26; At4g28850; involved in hydrolase activity and cell wall remodeling). SKS15 is related to a known SKU gene (SKU5), which is also known to have substantial impact on root growth and morphology [56]. Protein products of XTH26 reduce cell wall elongation in roots with altered root hair morphology [59], which may also impact the overall directionality or skewing of the root. The second category of genes whose differential expression between WS and Col-0 indicated a role in skewing (Category V; Genes 167–192; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between the ecotypes at both Agp 45° and 135. The transcription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles (Fig. 2), it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology (Additional file 2: Table S3). A couple of the genes identified include MODIFIER OF SNC1 2 (MOS2; At1g33520; where SNC1 is SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE and NPR1-1 is NONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1; At4g16890 and At1g64280, respectively) and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BEL10; At1g19700, where BEL1 is a homeodomain transcription factor controlling ovule patterning; At5g41410). MOS2 is a DNA-binding gene that plays a role in the immune response pathway and in microRNA (miRNA) maturation [60]. miRNAs are heavily involved in gene regulation [61]. Since Col-0 roots have higher transcript levels of MOS2 at both Agp 45° and 135° than WS, it is possible that miRNAs are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth parallel with gravity. The lower levels of MOS2 in WS roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing. BEL10 was upregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp 45° or 135° (Additional file 2: Table S3). BEL10 is a transcription factor that interacts with PLP, a blue light receptor also involved in response to salt or dehydration stresses [62]. Higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phosphate signaling pathways [36]. Additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redundant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth [63], which may, in turn, alter overall root directionality and impact skewing. The third category of genes that indicated a role in skewing (Category VI; Genes 193–256; Fig. 3c and Additional file 2: Table S3) contains genes that were differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS when roots were grown at Agp 135°. Since WS roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at Agp 90°, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. Some of the genes in this category include RESPONSIVE TO ABA 18 (RAB18; At5g66400) and PINOID BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1; At5g54490; Additional file 2: Table S3). RAB18 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. This dehydrin-related protein is reduced after exogenous 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) application, meaning it responds directly to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid (ABA) [64]. PBP1 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. Since this PINOID-binding protein is upregulated by auxin [65], the different PBP1 levels between Col-0 and WS could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes [65, 66]. Additional genes identified in Category VI will be discussed in the following section, due to their overlap with previously identified skew gene candidates.Eleven genes remaining across all sets are most likely to be involved in skewing in various processes A subset of most likely candidate genes was identified by the intersection of the list based on growth angle in WS and the list based on comparative gene expression between WS and Col-0 (Fig. 4), with the overlap of the two lists indicated in the Venn diagram, found in Fig. 4a. The list of 92 genes based on growth angle of WS (Fig. 4b; left heat map labeled “Physiology”) was compared to the list of 128 genes identified between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 4b; right heat map labeled “Genotype”), producing 16 genes that appear in both lists (Fig. 4a and b; Y* in both Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3). The majority of these 16 genes are found involving Agp 135°, shown in bold text and dark lines. Agp 135° was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in WS, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this Agp provides more support for their involvement in root skewing. These 11 genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC). The 11 HPSGC are involved in many different processes and were subjected to a thorough literature and expression map search using many available databases, such as Suba3, TAIR, and the Arabidopsis eFP browser [67–71]. These genes were searched with the goal of finding associations with cell expansion, division, auxin transport, or any process involved with root tropisms, so as to develop insights into their roles in skewing. Sub-organ localizations (e.g. columella cells, root tip, root hairs, etc.) were noted where possible. A summary of these results is found in Table 2. MIOX4 is expressed in root hairs, stele, and lateral root cap [71], and digested columella cells have lower transcript abundance in response to auxin [70]. Additionally, overexpression of MIOX4 in the presence of l-Ascorbic acid have increased root growth [72]. MIOX4 influences root growth responses during stressed conditions [73], but knockouts do not have abnormal cell walls, despite the role of MIOX4 upstream of polysaccharide integration into the cell wall [74]. PAP24 is not highly expressed in any root zones [69–71], but is predicted to be in plant cell walls and to have acid phosphatase and metal ion binding activity [67]. ASN1 is expressed in root hairs [71] and in the root under phosphate starvation [75]. ASN1 is also responsive to darkness and sucrose starvation, and may have a role in response to viral infections [76]. At2g25150 is highly expressed in the cortex under normal conditions [71], but is not shown to be auxin responsive [70]. In the literature, At2g25150 is described to have a product that is a BAHD enzyme with spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase activity in roots [77] and is upregulated by cytokinin activity [78], which is evidence for its activity in cell division [77]. SIS is not significantly expressed in roots under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the columella cells, root cap, and epidermis of Arabidopsis roots after 1 h of salt stress [79] and 1 hour at low pH [80]. SIS is also known to be involved in salt tolerance [67]. At5g66780 is not expressed in the root under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the root tip at low pH levels and under salt stress [74, 80]. Under normal conditions, At5g66780 is expressed in all zones along the root epidermis, though not contiguously [71]. This gene is unknown; no other published information exists on this gene. At3g28310 is expressed in the procambium of the root in the elongation zone [69, 71]. This gene produces a hypothetical protein with DUF677 [67] and is not well studied. DIN2 is not expressed in the root under normal condtions, but is upregulated in roots under salt stress [79] and in conditions lacking inorganic phosphate [75]. DIN2 mRNA can be transported from cell to cell [81], and is involved in a process that can lead to weakened root cell walls when under salt stress [82]. SEN1 is expressed in mature and developing root hairs [71], and is downregulated in the presence of auxin [70]. SEN1 is regulated by both methyl-jasmonate and salicylic acid [83], and strongly induced by phosphate starvation [84],. Knockout mutants are growth deficient in the light [67]. SWEET11 is present in the vasculature in the zone of maturation [71], and is downregulated in the cortex of sulfur-deficient roots after 24 h [80]. SWEET11 is a known sucrose efflux transporter that can assist with carbon transport to the roots in times of water stress [85]. HKT1 is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in Arabidopsis roots [69, 71], and is linked to salt and water stress responses [86]. Knockout hkt1 has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress [86]. HKT1 is also regulated by cytokinin [87], and has a close interaction with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4; At2g40220), where both gene products are expressed in the same cells and ABI4 binds to sites in the HKT1 promoter [88]. The 11 HPSGC show similar expression patterns in that none are particularly expressed in the root tip versus the rest of the root and are all closely related into one co-expression and co-localization network (Fig. 5), despite being members of disparate signaling pathways and potential activities (Table 2). These different signaling and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their individual gene members. For example, ASN1, SWEET11, and HKT1 are involved in sucrose response, sugar transport, and salt signaling, respectively. These three genes, which are not co-expressed or co-localized with one another, are all co-expressed with a common gene (SWEET12; Fig. 5), which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. Other HPSGC are involved with more downstream processes. DIN2 and SIS are involved in two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co-localized with one another, and are both co-localized with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 9 (ADF9; At4g34970) and PLANT INVERTASE/PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 47 (PME47; At5g04970; Fig. 5), both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling. Other genes pulled in by this co-expression and co-localization network are related to handling sugar signaling downstream of sensing, such as SUGAR TRANSPORTER 1 (STP1; At1g11260) and LIKE SEX4 1 (LSF1; At3g01510, where SEX4 is a plant-specific glucan phosphatase; Fig. 5). An additional network file shows the relationship between HPSGC and these additional genes [see Additional file 4]. This computational approach to the HPSGC illustrates possibilities for how these environmental sensing and signaling pathway genes could be involved in the generation of root skewing. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Co-expression and co-localization network of HPSGC shows each member is linked with others. Additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. Network generated with GeneMANIA [119]Sugar signaling is a major signaling pathway identified in the skew gene candidates. Sucrose efflux transporters SWEET11 and SWEET12 were both upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 45° and 135°. SWEET11, a member of the HPSGC, was also upregulated in Col-0 roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes are also associated with response to salt stress, divalent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomembrane system [89, 90]. SWEET11 and SWEET12 are shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast [91], with SWEET12 responding to CO2 as well [92]. This sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other members of the MtN3/saliva/SWEET-family of genes are involved with ion transport and physiological process regulation [93]. Root exudates are also involved in regulation of the surrounding microbiome and microenvironment [94], and these SWEET efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. Additionally, ASN1 was upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 135° and was downregulated in both Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). ASN1 responds to sucrose starvation, and mRNA accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests [95, 96]. Additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be involved in light/sugar signaling pathways (Additional file 1: Table S2). It is possible that ASN1 would be involved with the aforementioned SWEET family network. Both DIN2 and ASN1 were upregulated in the presence of various heavy metals, further implicating their roles in environmental signaling pathways [97], with ASN1 being expressed in the elongation and maturation zones in the root [71]. Other genes in the HPSGC are involved in sugar signaling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways. DIN2 is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starvation [96, 98]. DIN2 transcript is increased in the absence of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases [96]. Though technically a metallo-phosphoesterase and a type 5 acid phosphatase, PAP24 is a member of the HPSGC and may be involved in similar signaling pathways [99]. MIOX4 is suppressed in the shoot by exogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through InsP3 signaling cascades [73], which itself plays a role in response to gravitropic stimuli [100]. SEN1 is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor [101]. SEN1 itself may provide a link between glucose signaling and phosphate signaling [101], and is highly expressed in the meristematic zone of the root [71]. Salt signaling is another functional group identified in the HPSGC. HKT1 has a role in salt signaling in Arabidopsis roots [102], and is likely involved in loading sodium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations [86]. HKT1 activity is reduced by high calcium levels [103, 104], which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways. SIS also has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time [105]. Some of these salt-related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. For example, DIN2 is present in the columella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, while SIS is present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis [79].Conclusions This work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non-skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing.Methods Plants, treatments, and morphometric assays Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild type cultivars Col-0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5% Phytagel and poured in square-gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Seeds were wet sterilized in 1.7 mL Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using a 5-min 70% ethanol wash, followed by a 5 min 50% v/v sodium hypochlorate solution wash (8.3%; Clorox, Oakland, CA), followed by 6 washes with sterile ddH2O. Seeds were planted on plates and moved to 4 °C for 2 days, followed by three days of vertical growth (Agp 90°) in 19 °C +/- 2 °C, and 24-h fluorescent light at approximately 80 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR. Plates were photographed, moved to their respective experimental condition (Agp 45°, 90°, or 135°), and photographed again on day 8 after germination (day 5 after gravistimulation). Plants were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA). Images of 8 day old plates were stacked, aligned, and measured using JFilament plugin for ImageJ [106–108]. Root measurements were processed through a custom R script, available on GitHub [109]. Data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares [110]. Post hoc analysis was conducted using Scheffé’s method.RNA and microarray Roots were dissected from shoots and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five roots were used for each chip, and three chips were used per condition. Lateral roots were not quantified, but did not appear to be significantly different between treatments. Initial RNA concentration was determined by Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Final RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, from which biotin-labeled cRNA was generated using the 3′ IVT plus Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA was purified using magnetic beads and was fragmented. Following fragmentation, cRNA products (12.5 μg) were hybridized with rotation to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Initial data analysis was carried out using the MAS5 algorithm within the Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Microarray Core, University of Florida. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository [GSE83242].Data processing, comparison tools, and qRT-PCR validation Data were normalized using RMA algorithm using the Limma and Bioconductor packages in R. Differential analyses were processed using R and the Limma package in Bioconductor. Data were imported and organized in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Gene transcripts were significant if absolute value of the fold change was greater than 1 in a base 2 logarithmic scale, as well as a raw p-value cutoff of p < 0.05. All genes meeting these criteria were considered, mitigating the risk of false positives with the benefit of identifying as many genes as possible. False discovery rate (FDR)-correction was performed for further statistical power, with q < 0.05 being indicated in Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3. For comparisons between Col-0 and WS cultivars, genes with altered transcripts in all three growth environments were removed if the change was near the same magnitude, within ± 1 fold change (base 2 log scale). Heatmaps were generated using Gene-E (v. 3.0.204, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Gene data was researched using g:Profiler [89, 90], agriGO [111], ATTED-II [112], Biogrid [113, 114], UniProt [115], KEGG [116, 117], and STRING [118] online databases. Additional visualization of gene networks was created using GeneMANIA [119]. For qRT-PCR validation of transcriptome microarray data, 460 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers used were PAP24 (F: 5’ – ACACGATTGGAGAGAAGGCA – 3’; R: 5’ – AACCAAGGACACGATGAGCT – 3’), SEN1 (F: 5’ – AGGAAATGTTGCAGCAGAGG – 3’; R: 5’ – CGTTGATGGCTCTAGTCGGA – 3’), ASN1 (F: - GGAATATTTGGGGACGGTGC – 3’; R: 5’ – CGGGACATCAAGAACATCGG – 3’), and HKT1 (F: 5’ – TCTTGGAGTGACGGTGCTAG – 3’; R: 5’ – CAGAGGTCCATTCAAAGGCG – 3’). The cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green reagents and was normalized to UBQ11 prior to the internal vertical control comparison or the Col-0 to WS comparison.Acknowledgements The authors thank Dr. Alberto Riva, Dr. Yanping Zhang, and the entire UF ICBR for their assistance in microarray analysis and data processing.

Open in a new tabValue of the data •T-DNA insertion lines provide important resource for genetic analysis based on mutagenesis in plant research. SALK lines are the most widely used T-DNA insertion lines for the model plant Arabidopsis. Accurate assessment of insertions is critical for understanding the value of the insertion lines. •SALK_084889 is annotated as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A, a key regulator of drought and heat response in Arabidopsis. We characterized DREB2A expression in normal and drought conditions in this line, which is relevant for analysis of DREB2A mutants in further investigation. •The LOX1 gene plays a critical role in multiple bioprocesses associated with lipid peroxidation. Our data identified a T-DNA insertion within promoter of LOX1 and showed the knock-out expression of LOX1 in SALK_084889. These are valuable information for mutation analysis of LOX1. 1.

Experimental design, materials and methods Arabidopsis seeds of wild tyoe (Col) and SALK_084889 were obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. SALK_084889 was reported as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A (AT5G05410) gene [1]. For identification of T-DNA insertion sites, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in soil at 22 °C under constant light condition. Eight randomly selected SALK_084889 seedlings were subjected to DNA-PCR to confirm all seeds are homozygous. For DREB2A, the gene specific primers DREB2A-F and DREB2A-R were used to amplify wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and DREB2A-R primers were used to amplify T-DNA band. For LOX1, the gene specific primers LOX1-F and LOX1-R were used to amplify wild type allele band while LBb1.3 and LOX1-R primers were used to amplify T-DNA band. The amplicons of T-DNA bands of DREB2A and LOX1 were purified by subjected to sanger sequencing and the alignment of sequences was performed using Vector NTI v10.0 program (InforMax Inc). For Expression analysis, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in 0.5× MS media (2.2 g of MS basal salts (Sigma), 5 g of Sucrose, 0.5 g of MES, and 1 mL of 1,000× Gamborg vitamins (Sigma) per liter at pH 5.75) at 22 °C under constant light condition. The 14 day old plants were harvested from MS plates and directly preserved in RNALater (Ambion) [2]. For drought treatment, harvested Arabidopsis plants were dehydrated on Whatman 3mm paper (Whatman) at 22 °C and 60% humidity under dim light for 2 h [3] prior to fixation in RNALater. For RNA extraction, root and shoot tissues were dissected in RNALater solution and then total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Quantitative realtime PCR was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and 2-ΔΔCt method was employed to calculate the relative expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1. Three replicates were used for each sample and UBQ11 (AT4G05050) gene was used as the internal control. For drought and heat tolerance determination of SALK_084889, Col and SALK_084889 seeds were grown in soil at 22 °C under constant light condition. For drought test, the 10 day old plants were transferred to pre-dried soil and withhold water for 4 days prior to recovery by watering for 7 days [4]. For heat test, the 7 day old plants were pre-incubated in 37 °C for 1 h and then treated at 49 °C for 1 h prior to recovery in 22 °C for 2 days [5]. Survival rates and phenotypes of Col and SALK_084889 plants were recorded. Student׳s t-test was used for statistical analysis.Acknowledgements The authors thank the support from members of the UF Space Plants Lab.

    "title": "Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plants, as much as any other complex eukaryotic organisms, mount specific transcriptional responses to an environment in order to accomplish physiological adaptation and survival in that environment. Heat shock, salt, cold, drought and hypoxia are among the most well studied environmental responses in plants, and mutant studies of these responses have been key to showing that a given aspect of the response is necessary and appropriate for survival (e.g. [1, 2–8]). However, in each of these examples, the environmental stress was a part of the evolutionary history of plants and the development of a stress response for survival seems logically appropriate. Knocking out those appropriate responses has a negative effect on survival under that environmental stress (e.g. [9, 10, 11]), and manipulation of the response can modify the degree of stress that can be overcome (e.g. [12, 13–15]). Spaceflight, however, presents an environmental situation that is well outside of the evolutionary history of plants, wherein plants have had no exposure to develop adaptive strategies, and this situation creates the possibility that environmental signals in spaceflight could be inappropriately activating non-adaptive responses. The possibility of non-adaptive responses to spaceflight presents an added dimension to the goal of understanding plant growth in space and the fundamental biological questions of adaptation to truly novel environments. What is the measure of successful adaptation to a new environment? Is it possible to gauge the impact of a novel environment on the basis of molecular responses? Can inappropriate responses be genetically removed, thereby reducing the transcriptome costs of developing appropriate adaptation responses? In this study, these questions were explored simply on the basis of measuring the intensity and complexity of the patterns of differential gene expression in response to spaceflight in different genotypes. The data presented here look at a very specific set of cells–the last 2 mm of the primary root of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which represents the primary gravity-sensing region of the plant root (e.g. [16, 17]. These data compared specific genotypes in order to dissect the spaceflight responses of plants as they germinated and continued their development on the International Space Station. These plants were not undergoing transitional physiological adaptation to a new environment, but rather, from the moment of germination, they experienced an environment that is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism. This study therefore identifies the genes engaged by the cells of the root tip in the spaceflight environment compared to similar plants on the ground, and then asks how variations in genetic background, and the lighting sub-environment on the International Space Station, impact the differential expression of genes. The experimental design extrapolates primarily from the APEX01 (Advanced Plant Experiment 01) Arabidopsis spaceflight experiment. APEX01 illustrated that during spaceflight in microgravity, Arabidopsis plants utilized the gradient of light established in the growth hardware to orient the directional axis of growth, and demonstrated unique, genotype-specific patterns of root growth [18, 19]. On the ground, the roots grew vertically down the surface of the plate, but surprisingly, so did the roots on orbit, but not straight “down” in a negatively phototropic direction; the roots instead progressed in a distinctive skewing pattern, such as seen on Earth when grown on tilted surfaces (e.g. [20]. The skewing growth pattern was interesting from the perspective that skewing was long thought to require gravity, but also from the perspective that the two genotypes flown–Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia-0 (Col-0)–exhibited distinctly different skewing morphometrics, which were enhanced over what was typical on the ground. WS and Col-0 are genotypically distinct and therefore possess potentially different tools to respond to any given set of environments [21, 22]. Spaceflight studies by Blancaflor and colleagues demonstrated that Col-0 skews more dramatically in the dark than in the light, and that genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton can impact root morphology in microgravity [23, 24]. Spaceflight studies by Kiss and colleagues established that the interplay of specific wavelengths of light and manipulation of light-receptor genes can have a dramatic impact on the morphology of seedling growth in microgravity and fractional gravity, and have shown that the Arabidopsis cultivar Landsberg also exhibits skewing [25–29]. Light plays a larger role in root behavior in the spaceflight environment, and nuanced impact of the genomic background appears to be more easily revealed when gravity is not the dominant tropic force acting on the plant. Among the genes that differ between WS and Col-0 is phytochrome D (PhyD), which encodes a PHYB-like member of the family. PHYD appears to work in conjunction with PHYB for shade avoidance in terrestrial habitats [30, 31], but appears to have virtually no role in gravitropism [32]. However, although WS lacks PhyD transcription it does contain normal levels of PhyA, PhyB, and PhyC [30]. There is considerable overlap in the roles of the members of the phytochrome family, but a mutation in PhyD in a Col-0 background mimics some of the phenotypic features of the WS ecotype (e.g. [33]). The role of PhyD in shade avoidance, and also its lack of a role in gravity sensing, contributed to our interest in the gene, but the fact that the deletion of a single, seemingly inconsequential gene in Col-0 could also phenocopy features of the wild-type WS cultivar was especially intriguing, and led us to choose the Col-0 phyD line for inclusion in a transcriptome comparison of the wild type WS and Col-0 genotypes in the spaceflight environment. The experiment described here examined the influence of genotype on the physiological adaptation to spaceflight as measured by gene expression patterns. RNAseq transcriptome profiling provided the metric by which to measure the impact of the environment, and address whether it is possible to eliminate all or part of the spaceflight response by manipulating the genotype of the plant.",

    "results": "Results Plant growth and development in the open ISS habitat In contrast to the focused lighting and environmentally controlled habitat used in the APEX01 experiment [18, 38], the CARA Petri plates were deployed to a wall inside the Destiny module of the ISS, where they received just the ambient, low level, indirect lighting of the module. It was not possible to completely eliminate all lighting gradients, as the surface of the Petri plate mounted on the wall (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber for the ground controls) will naturally not receive ambient light through the surface flush to the wall. The plates also received the ambient cabin air, temperature and humidity (Fig 1A). The design of the experiment included a set of light-grown plates and dark-grown plates, with three replicate plates of each genotype (WS, Col-0 and phyD) in each condition. All of the plates were configured to keep the seeds in a dormant state until integration on the ISS, a process that included protecting the seeds from light with black cloth wrappings [34]. Thus, the first action of the astronaut was to expose all of the plates to light to activate germination (Fig 1A) and then to re-wrap the dark-grown plates in light-proof cloth (Fig 1B). Identical procedures were initiated in the comparable ground controls grown in the ISSES chamber (Fig 1C and 1D). Development without clear directional cues The developmental progress of plant growth was followed through a series of photographs taken by the attending astronaut on the ISS, and by the attending technician at KSC, providing an independent “pseudonaut” on the ground in order to mimic astronaut activities on the ISS. The photographs in Fig 2 show representative images that compared the progress of growth after 3d, 6d and 9d for each genotype. The photographs were taken through the back of each plate. The region of interest was cropped from each astronaut-captured photograph to better display the progress of plant development. The full, uncropped, photographs are deposited in the NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120). The spaceflight-grown plants are shown in the left-hand column (Flight). Fig 2. A comparison of the growth of the three genotypes in the light at 3 days, 6 days and 9 days.

This configuration of plant growth closely resembles patterns seen in plates grown horizontally on the ground (Phytagel surface parallel to Earth’s surface). However, unlike horizontal growth in a unit gravity environment, the root coils were loose and somewhat unorganized. In contrast, the roots of the ground control plants shown in the right-hand column (Ground) grew in a clear, positively gravitropic manner along the surface of the plate media. As described in the Methods section, the ground control plates were oriented vertically (Phytagel surface perpendicular to the Earth’s surface), a growth configuration that encourages root growth along the surface of the Phytagel in a reasonably straight, positively geotropic manner. The hypocotyls were generally oriented in a negatively geotropic manner, but were also angled away from the less well-lit surface of the plate adjacent to the wall, towards the relatively lighter environment of the room. These types of spaceflight growth patterns are distinctly different from what has been seen in the high-light plant growth hardware of Veggie [39] and the strong, directional lighting of the ABRS hardware [18, 19]. The developmental image series in Fig 2 shows that both the spaceflight (left column) and ground control (right column) plants of all three genotypes were virtually identical in terms of apparent health, vigor, and developmental age within each environment. However, due to the rather dim lighting environment, neither the light-grown spaceflight nor light-grown ground control plants had the developmental appearance Arabidopsis plants of comparable ages grown in the more optimal lighting regimes of the ABRS and Veggie plant growth habitats [18, 19, 39]. Final photographs of the plants were taken after 11 days of growth, and then the plants were harvested to KFTs (Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes) containing RNAlater. Fig 3 shows the photographs taken just prior to harvest. These photographs were taken from the front surface with the plate lid removed. The light-grown plants are shown in Fig 3A. The 11 day spaceflight seedlings (Flight) are shown on the left, and the comparable ground controls (Ground) are shown on the right. The dark-grown plants are shown in Fig 3B, again with the spaceflight grown plants on the left, and the ground controls on the right. There are some minor morphological differences in the manner in which the different genotypes grow, but these differences in coiling and skewing are well characterized features of each genotype, and consistent with morphometric evaluations from previous spaceflight experiments (e.g. [18, 40, 41]).

These observations suggest that regardless of the gene expression changes among these genotypes, all three were equally able to adapt to spaceflight. Root length was chosen as a key, quantifiable trait for plant productivity in light-grown plants; root length has been associated with plant health and crop success [42], and the photos taken on the ISS provide clear resolution of root growth. Fig 4 compares the root length of each genotype in both spaceflight and ground control environments derived from the images. Root measurements were made using ImageJ, and the data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares to compare the independent variables of genotype and environment [40, 43]. When grown in the light, only WS grown on the ground was significantly different from any other combination of genotype and environment (F2,310 = 12.112, p<0.001), WS, Col-0 and phyD were not different from each other with regards to root length in spaceflight. Fig 4. The root lengths among genotypes grown on orbit were not significantly different from one another. Open in a new tab The box for each genotype/treatment combination contains a line indicating the median, and an \"x\" indicating the mean. Above each box is a designation of the results of Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference, following the two-way ANOVA, where shared letters indicate insignificant difference. Only one of the six sample sets (WS.GC) was different from the other five. Genotype matters in spaceflight transcriptional responses The transcriptional response that each genotype mounted in their respective environments was very distinct. The Venn diagrams of Fig 5 provide an overview of the Spaceflight to Ground root-tip transcriptome comparisons of each genotype; values from light-grown plants are shown in Fig 5A, and dark-grown plants in Fig 5B. The size of the Venn circles are to scale with respect to the numbers of differentially expressed genes. The genes that comprise the list show at least a two-fold change (-1<log2<1) with FDR<0.05. The greatest difference in the transcriptomes of spaceflight and ground control plants was seen in light-grown Col-0 plants, with a total of 297 genes. The spaceflight to ground differences in the other two light-grown genotypes were a total of 130 in phyD, and then only 71 in the WS genotype. A fourth (18/71) of the WS differentially expressed genes were also coordinately expressed in the other two genotypes. Almost all (6/7) of the coordinately expressed genes that were downregulated compared to the ground controls were associated with light signaling. In the upregulated genes, about half (6/11) were associated with plant defense or cell wall metabolism. Fig 5. A Venn diagram displaying the distribution of coordinately expressed genes in response to spaceflight in all three genotypes. Open in a new tab (A) Coordinately expressed genes in the root tips of light-grown plants. (B) Coordinately expressed genes in the root tips of dark-grown plants. Coordinately expressed genes common to all three genotypes are annotated below each diagram. The number of differentially expressed genes associated with cell wall processes are indicated as black dots within each representative sector of the diagram. The small number (11 in the light and 17 in the dark) of significantly expressed genes that are represented in two genotypes, but were changed in opposite directions (up in one genotype while down in the other), are not included in the enumerations of coordinately expressed genes in the Venn diagrams.In the dark-grown plants, the distribution of differentially expressed genes between spaceflight and ground is quite different than was seen in the light-grown plants. In the dark, the WS and Col-0 cultivars showed roughly the same number of differentially expressed genes (218 and 224, respectively. In the dark, phyD exhibited the fewest differentially expressed genes (131). There were fewer coordinately expressed genes common to all genotypes (only 11). The single down regulated gene was associated with methionine biosynthesis, and two of the 10 upregulated genes have been associated with plant defense or cell wall metabolism. Among the three genotypes, 129 genes were differentially expressed in both the light and the dark (Supporting S1 Table). However, only one gene was coordinately expressed in both the light and the dark in all three genotypes: ATARD3 (AT2G26400—Acireductone Dioxygenase 3). There were also a small number of genes that while overlapping in significant, differential expression between genotypes, rather than being coordinately expressed they were changed in the opposite direction. These genes (11 in the light and 17 in the dark) are not included among the genes represented in the Venn Diagram of Fig 5. Genes associated with cell wall metabolism seemed prevalent among the differentially expressed genes. In order to create a standardized evaluation of the number of genes representing cell wall associated process, the differentially expressed gene sets used in Fig 5 were cross-referenced with two cell wall databases: the Purdue University Cell Wall Related Gene Families data sets (https://cellwall.genomics.purdue.edu/families/index.html) [44] and the SUBcellular localization database for Arabidopsis proteins (SUBA3—http://suba3.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/) [45]. Genes were considered as cell wall associated if they were identified as such in either database. For graphic visualization, the numbers of genes identified with these comparisons are indicated as black dots within each Venn section in Fig 5. In addition, each gene ID number is identified with bold text and gold highlighting in the fully annotated Supplementary S2 and S3 Tables. Transcriptional responses between flight and ground The genes enumerated in the Venn diagram of Fig 5 are shown as transcriptome heat-maps in Fig 6, in order to illustrate the distribution of differential expression among the genotypes along with fold-change. Fig 6 presents two sets of transcriptome heat maps that compare the patterns of gene expression between spaceflight and the equivalent ground controls for each genotype in the Light (Fig 6A) and in the Dark (Fig 6B). The heat maps were generated with GeneE software, utilizing statistically significant (FDR<0.05) expressed genes with differential expression of at least two-fold (-1<log2<1) in at least one comparison. The genes were sorted by Atg number, and hierarchical clustering was established using Jaccard distance. Each row of the heat map within each treatment (6A and 6B, respectively) corresponds to the same gene within each genotype. Significantly down regulated genes are indicated in green and significantly upregulated are in red. Genes depicted as gray did not meet either the fold-change or FDR criteria within that genotype. The gene rows are not collinear between 6A and 6B, but each heat map is presented to the same vertical scale. In the light, there were a total of 394 genes that were significantly, differentially expressed by at least two-fold in at least one genotype, and in the dark there were 461. Both the Light and Dark heat maps are annotated with the gene ID for selected cell wall-associated genes represented in the clusters of genes unique to a single genotype. The fully annotated heat maps can be found in Supporting S2 Table (FLT vs GC–Light) and Supporting S3 Table (FLT vs GC–Dark). In the Supporting tables, gene entries that have been associated with the cell wall (criteria described above) are indicated in bold text, and the gene ID number has been highlighted in gold. Fig 6.

Any gene indicated with a color is statistically significant (FDR<0.05) and expressed to a level of at least 2-fold (-1 <log2> 1). The color scale ranges from -3 log2 (down 8-fold) to +3 log2 (up 8-fold). Genes with a differential expression value greater than 8-fold are presented in the same hue as for an 8-fold change. Heat maps are annotated with selected cell wall associated genes that are unique to each genotype. The total number of genes represented in the heat maps are indicated below each map. The fully annotated heat maps are provided in Supporting S2 Table.In the light, the physiological adaptation of cultivar WS to the spaceflight environment required the fewest number of changes in gene expression, while cultivar Col-0 required about five times as many changes in gene expression. The mutation of the PhyD gene in Col-0 resulted in an almost 3-fold reduction in the number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight. As presented in the Venn Diagrams of Fig 5, there were very few genes that were coordinately expressed among all three genotypes, and differentially expressed genes held in common between even two genotypes were also scarce. The differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those differentially expressed genes that were shared with another genotype. In the light, the upregulated differentially expressed genes unique to WS were largely associated with the cell wall, and processes in root hairs, including pathogen responses and development. The unique downregulated genes largely encoded transporters, along with several associated with plant defense, abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling. The over 200 uniquely expressed genes of Col-0 represented a wide range of diverse functions; defense, oxidative stress, cell wall metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress, and hormone signaling, and were well represented in both up and down regulated genes. The uniquely expressed genes of the Col-0 phyD mutant also encoded a similar diversity of gene categories, however phyD did not express the same representative genes from these categories, and there were fewer representatives of genes associated with stress responses in phyD. All three genotypes uniquely expressed about the same proportion of genes associated with the cell wall, with values ranging between 14% and 17%. In the dark, WS and Col-0 exhibited about the same total number of differentially expressed genes for the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. About 20% were coordinately expressed in both cultivars, but the types of genes that are coordinately expressed do not appear to represent a substantially different category of genes than those which are uniquely expressed in each genotype. In the dark, phyD exhibited the smallest number of differentially expressed genes among the three genotypes, and only about 15% were also differentially expressed in Col-0. In the dark, although many genes were again associated with defense, oxidative stress, and cell wall metabolism, there were also more genes associated with hormone metabolism (auxin, ABA and GA), and gravitropism than were seen in the light. Again, all three genotypes uniquely expressed about the same proportion of genes associated with the cell wall, with values ranging between 14% and 16%. The transcriptomic differences exhibited by the different genotypes in response to spaceflight are underscored by the transcriptome differences between the genotypes in any given environment. Fig 7 shows the extent of how the transcriptomic responses of each genotype varied from each other when grown on the ground or in spaceflight. Pair-wise comparisons are shown between Col-0 and phyD, Col-0 and WS, and then phyD and WS; each within the four different environments: lighted environment on the ground, lighted environment in spaceflight, dark environment on the ground, and dark environment in spaceflight. In the light, there are fewer differences among genotypes in the ground controls than in spaceflight, whereas in the dark, there are more differences among genotypes on the ground than in spaceflight. The fully annotated heat maps can be found in Supporting S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 Tables. Fig 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion Plants in spaceflight differentially express genes compared to their ground controls, suggesting that physiological adaptation is taking place in plants on orbit. There have now been a number of transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons of Arabidopsis and other plants grown in spaceflight environments [19, 23, 38, 46–57] and the topic of plant growth in space has been recently reviewed [58–63]. In addition, there is more to growing in an orbital environment than the simple removal of gravity. Transcriptome comparisons of plants growing in artificial gravity environments generated by a centrifuge on the ISS illustrates that simply returning some form of gravity to the spaceflight environment does not completely ameliorate the transcriptional and proteomic response [51, 64, 65]. The general consensus from these studies is that while there is no single set of genes that are representative hallmarks of growth in the spaceflight environment, most plants do appear to differentially express genes associated with several consistent categories of genes. Genes associated with cell wall remodeling, cell polarity, and ROS signaling predominate, but the exact same genes are not utilized among all plants, plant organs, and experiments. Indeed there is no obvious consensus of what a canonical spaceflight response might be in plants or among plant cells, except perhaps for these categories of genes rather than specific genes. Although root growth patterns were distinct between spaceflight and ground control plants, all three genotypes were developmentally comparable to the ground control plants. (Figs 2 and 3) and all three genotypes were equally productive in terms of root length in spaceflight. However, the molecular means to effect the physiological adaptation necessary to achieve comparable growth in the spaceflight environment was highly dependent on the genotype. Each genotype used almost completely different sets of genes to physiologically adapt their metabolism to the lighted environment of the ISS, and the number of differentially expressed genes was dramatically different among the genotypes. While Col-0 differentially expressed 297 genes to accomplish its physiological adaptation, WS accomplished adaptation with only 71 differentially expressed genes. Plants of the phyD mutant of Col-0 differentially expressed 127 genes. If differential gene expression is a measure of the degree or cost of the physiological adaptive response, then WS would be considered more highly spaceflight adapted than Col-0 and the phyD mutation would be considered a spaceflight adaptive mutation in Col-0 background. In other words, much of the Col-0 spaceflight response can be eliminated with a simple mutation in PhyD, without apparently compromising plant health or development or adding stress responses at the gene expression level. Indeed, the phyD plants did not appear to be at any disadvantage with respect to root navigation on orbit, where light is the primary tropic cue, nor did the phyD spaceflight transcriptome suggest a disruption of light-mediated signaling. Rather, relieving Col-0 of the gene encoding PhyD appeared to lighten the demands on the processes engaged to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. The converting the genome to WS further lightened the adaptive demands at the transcriptome level. The data in Fig 5 further suggest that much of the differential gene expression exhibited by all three genotypes in the light of the ISS is non adaptive, or at least dispensable. For example, out of the 297 differentially expressed genes in Col-0, 217 of them appear dispensable, as neither phyD nor WS shared those differential gene expressions. Moreover, these three genotypes shared only 18 genes with similar differential gene expression patterns. This suggests the possibility that most of the gene expression responses in these genotypes, in these cells, were not fundamentally required for physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to spaceflight. The 18 coordinately expressed genes shared amongst the genotypes may well present two categories of adaptive metabolism that are universally important to growing in a spaceflight environment (Fig 5). The seven down-regulated genes in this set have all been associated with light signal transduction, whereas most of the eleven up-regulated genes have been associated with plant defense responses. These genes represent two strong trends seen throughout these data as well as other published transcriptomic responses of plants in spaceflight: modified light signal transduction and modified cell wall metabolism. Overall, the transcriptome responses for all three genotypes were enriched in these two categories, as well as for oxidative stress, genes associated with auxin, ABA and GA signaling, and general abiotic stress. The prevalence of representatives from these categories among the highly differentially expressed genes in all three genotypes could suggest that the adaptive process was generally the same for all three genotypes. However, the difference in the total numbers of differentially expressed genes among the genotypes could suggest that some genotypes expended far less effort to achieve a comparable adaptive metabolism. Plants germinated and then grown in the dark on the ISS present a similar conclusion, although with different genes and differing numbers of gene expression changes. The phyD mutant differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0, and only 11 genes were similarly differentially expressed among Col-0, phyD and WS. As was also seen in the light-grown plants, most of the differentially expressed genes of any particular genotype grown in the dark can be eliminated without affecting the ability to grow on the ISS. It is important to note that the 18 genes shared among the differentially expressed genes of all three genotypes in the light of the ISS are almost completely distinct from the 11 shared differentially expressed genes of the dark grown ISS plants; only one gene, ATARD3, is common to both sets (Fig 5). ATARD3 has not been well characterized in the literature, but the gene has been loosely associated with pathogen response [66, 67] and cell wall metabolism [68]. Thus, in this experiment with three genotypes and two different ISS environments, there is only one universally differentially expressed gene in the root tips of spaceflight plants, and this gene is not represented in previously identified spaceflight transcriptomes. Therefore these data appear inconsistent with the concept that there is a basic required adaptive response to spaceflight that would be common among all plant cells and in under all conditions.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions The primary conclusion of this work is that much of the plant response to spaceflight is potentially non-adaptive in that at least most of the gene expression responses could be genetically eliminated without overtly compromising growth in space. This suggests that responses to truly novel environments may include responses from signals that are inappropriately activated or misinterpreted, and further suggests that these inappropriate responses can be genetically eliminated without adverse consequences. For spaceflight in particular, these data suggest that genetic manipulation can produce varieties that are better adapted to growth in spaceflight through elimination of unnecessary responses. A secondary conclusion of this work is that there is no fundamental spaceflight response that characterizes plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Rather, the adaptive response is dependent upon the genotype of the plant and the specific environment within which it grows. The response also appears highly organ specific, as roots and leaves share few spaceflight differential genes in common [38, 47]. And yet, it remains possible and even likely that classes of differentially expressed genes will continue to be shared amongst cell types, genotypes and environments in space. However there is no overt indication that specific genes will be differentially expressed in all spaceflight plants. These conclusions lie in sharp contrast to evolutionarily defined and well characterized terrestrial stress responses. Heat shock, cold shock, salt, pathogen attack and other stresses show commonality of differential expression across cell types and local environments. HSPs are HSPs in all plant cells. Since no such commonality exists in spaceflight responses, it appears that at least large portions of the spaceflight responses in plants are not necessary, and therefore can be eliminated without negative impact on plant life in spaceflight and opening the possibility of selecting plant genotypes optimized for spaceflight growth. The differential expression of categories of genes, rather than individual genes, exhibited in the overall plant spaceflight response could be interpreted as support for the notion that certain categories of responses are either necessary for spaceflight physiological adaptation, or a common consequence of interpreting this novel environment. A common theme that appears to remain consistent among plant spaceflight transcriptomes is that of cell wall remodeling. Genes encoding proteins associated with cell wall remodeling have characterized the spaceflight response among several experiments and genotypes [23, 38, 47, 48, 51, 52, 56, 57, 65]. Cell wall remodeling genes are represented in the differentially expressed genes are richly represented in this experiment as well (Fig 6, Supporting S2 and S3 Tables). Thus cell wall remodeling appears to be, for the most part, a requirement or an unavoidable consequence of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Yet the differential gene expression that characterizes that response may be highly cell, genotype and environment specific, and indeed may not actually be required for successful adaptation. Future experiments can be directed to establishing the minimal responses to spaceflight by further mutational and environmental manipulations, and can thereby contribute to systems engineering of spaceflight habitats. Plant growth in actual life support functions within space exploration is an important technical engineering challenge. Growing plants on petri plates allows what is likely the most benign growth system possible in spaceflight absent artificial gravity. Water management is not necessary, as the Phytagel provides water to the roots without potential flooding that can be seen in larger scale plant production systems on orbit or within exploration vehicles. Light and air management is quite similar to situations in terrestrial laboratories. It is quite possible that more stress responses will be seen in larger plant growth units on orbit, where water, nutrient and air management become more of an issue than for plants grown on plates. Engineering solutions to those issues can draw upon these plants-on-plates to better understand achievable stress reduction goals.",

Copyright notice ID: 5491145 PMID: 28662188 Abstract Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.Introduction Plants, as much as any other complex eukaryotic organisms, mount specific transcriptional responses to an environment in order to accomplish physiological adaptation and survival in that environment. Heat shock, salt, cold, drought and hypoxia are among the most well studied environmental responses in plants, and mutant studies of these responses have been key to showing that a given aspect of the response is necessary and appropriate for survival (e.g. [1, 2–8]). However, in each of these examples, the environmental stress was a part of the evolutionary history of plants and the development of a stress response for survival seems logically appropriate. Knocking out those appropriate responses has a negative effect on survival under that environmental stress (e.g. [9, 10, 11]), and manipulation of the response can modify the degree of stress that can be overcome (e.g. [12, 13–15]). Spaceflight, however, presents an environmental situation that is well outside of the evolutionary history of plants, wherein plants have had no exposure to develop adaptive strategies, and this situation creates the possibility that environmental signals in spaceflight could be inappropriately activating non-adaptive responses. The possibility of non-adaptive responses to spaceflight presents an added dimension to the goal of understanding plant growth in space and the fundamental biological questions of adaptation to truly novel environments. What is the measure of successful adaptation to a new environment? Is it possible to gauge the impact of a novel environment on the basis of molecular responses? Can inappropriate responses be genetically removed, thereby reducing the transcriptome costs of developing appropriate adaptation responses? In this study, these questions were explored simply on the basis of measuring the intensity and complexity of the patterns of differential gene expression in response to spaceflight in different genotypes. The data presented here look at a very specific set of cells–the last 2 mm of the primary root of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which represents the primary gravity-sensing region of the plant root (e.g. [16, 17]. These data compared specific genotypes in order to dissect the spaceflight responses of plants as they germinated and continued their development on the International Space Station. These plants were not undergoing transitional physiological adaptation to a new environment, but rather, from the moment of germination, they experienced an environment that is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism. This study therefore identifies the genes engaged by the cells of the root tip in the spaceflight environment compared to similar plants on the ground, and then asks how variations in genetic background, and the lighting sub-environment on the International Space Station, impact the differential expression of genes. The experimental design extrapolates primarily from the APEX01 (Advanced Plant Experiment 01) Arabidopsis spaceflight experiment. APEX01 illustrated that during spaceflight in microgravity, Arabidopsis plants utilized the gradient of light established in the growth hardware to orient the directional axis of growth, and demonstrated unique, genotype-specific patterns of root growth [18, 19]. On the ground, the roots grew vertically down the surface of the plate, but surprisingly, so did the roots on orbit, but not straight “down” in a negatively phototropic direction; the roots instead progressed in a distinctive skewing pattern, such as seen on Earth when grown on tilted surfaces (e.g. [20]. The skewing growth pattern was interesting from the perspective that skewing was long thought to require gravity, but also from the perspective that the two genotypes flown–Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia-0 (Col-0)–exhibited distinctly different skewing morphometrics, which were enhanced over what was typical on the ground. WS and Col-0 are genotypically distinct and therefore possess potentially different tools to respond to any given set of environments [21, 22]. Spaceflight studies by Blancaflor and colleagues demonstrated that Col-0 skews more dramatically in the dark than in the light, and that genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton can impact root morphology in microgravity [23, 24]. Spaceflight studies by Kiss and colleagues established that the interplay of specific wavelengths of light and manipulation of light-receptor genes can have a dramatic impact on the morphology of seedling growth in microgravity and fractional gravity, and have shown that the Arabidopsis cultivar Landsberg also exhibits skewing [25–29]. Light plays a larger role in root behavior in the spaceflight environment, and nuanced impact of the genomic background appears to be more easily revealed when gravity is not the dominant tropic force acting on the plant. Among the genes that differ between WS and Col-0 is phytochrome D (PhyD), which encodes a PHYB-like member of the family. PHYD appears to work in conjunction with PHYB for shade avoidance in terrestrial habitats [30, 31], but appears to have virtually no role in gravitropism [32]. However, although WS lacks PhyD transcription it does contain normal levels of PhyA, PhyB, and PhyC [30]. There is considerable overlap in the roles of the members of the phytochrome family, but a mutation in PhyD in a Col-0 background mimics some of the phenotypic features of the WS ecotype (e.g. [33]). The role of PhyD in shade avoidance, and also its lack of a role in gravity sensing, contributed to our interest in the gene, but the fact that the deletion of a single, seemingly inconsequential gene in Col-0 could also phenocopy features of the wild-type WS cultivar was especially intriguing, and led us to choose the Col-0 phyD line for inclusion in a transcriptome comparison of the wild type WS and Col-0 genotypes in the spaceflight environment. The experiment described here examined the influence of genotype on the physiological adaptation to spaceflight as measured by gene expression patterns. RNAseq transcriptome profiling provided the metric by which to measure the impact of the environment, and address whether it is possible to eliminate all or part of the spaceflight response by manipulating the genotype of the plant.Materials and methods CARA experiment seed lines and planting Three seed lines wild-types Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Col-0 PhyD (phyD) (SALK_027956C) were tested for viability, sterility and the ability to maintain dormancy before launch. Vetted batches of seeds were planted on Phytagel plates [18]. One genotype was planted per plate, and six plates were planted of each genotype. One complete set of 18 plates was planted for growth on the International Space Station (ISS), and a comparable set of 18 plates was planted 24 hours later for the ground controls. The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by at least two layers of Duvetyne Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) to help preserve dormancy [34]. The plates were stored at 4°C until launch (six days). All seed lines are available through TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/).Launch, orbital operations of flight and ground control plates The plates of the CARA experiment launched in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4°C within the Dragon Capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS-3 occurred on April 18th, 2014 to the ISS (increment 39). The cargo Dragon Capsule was carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. CARA is also identified by the NASA operations nomenclature (OpNom) of “Petri Plants”, and was one of the ARK1 payloads flown by the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1064.html). The astronaut attending the experiment on the ISS was Expedition 39 Flight Engineer Steve Swanson. The dormant plates were activated on the ISS by bringing them out of cold stowage and removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping, 12 days after launch. The plates were then secured to a fabric support affixed to the wall in the US Lab of the Destiny module (Fig 1). The plants were allowed to grow on orbit for 11 days; some in the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark. A standard light meter was not available on the ISS, so ambient light levels were approximated through the use of iPad (iPad3, iOS 5.1.1) application “Light Meter HD- lux measurement tool”, which was executed by astronaut Steve Swanson. It was estimated that the light-grown plates received between 4–6 μmoles m-2 s-1 total light. The dark-grown plates were first activated by exposure to light, (the Black-Out cloth was removed from the designated plates for 4 hours), and then re-wrapped in Black-Out cloth for the duration of the growth period. Fig 1. Experiment configuration and growth habitats. Open in a new tab (A) The flight plates attached to the wall of the Destiny module of the International Space Station. (B) After germination was initiated by exposure to light, the dark-grown plates were re-wrapped in Duvetyne Black-Out cloth. (C) The ground control plates attached to the wall of the ISS Environment Simulations (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center in a vertical orientation for growth. (D) The dark-grown plates in the ISSES chamber after re-wrapping.At 11 days, seedlings were photographed, and then harvested into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) containing RNAlater. The plants were allowed to perfuse for 12–18 hours at ambient temperature within the KFTs, and then the KFTs were transferred to the MELFI (Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS). The frozen KFTs were returned to cold stowage within the Dragon Capsule at the end of the docked operations period, and were returned to Earth on May 18, 2014. Following the Dragon Capsule splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the frozen KFTs were transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80°C freezer on May 22, 2014. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs on May 29, 2014 and transferred the frozen samples back to the University of Florida. A comparable set of plates and operations comprised the experimental control set (referred to as the ground control). The plates of the ground control were grown at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) within the ISS Environment Simulator (ISSES) Chamber. The ground control was initiated 24 hours after the initiation of the spaceflight experiment to facilitate the programing the ISSES Chamber with the ISS environmental conditions experienced by the flight plates in the prior 24 hours. The environmental parameters that were monitored and then programed into the ISSES chamber included temperature, CO2 and relative humidity. In addition, the lighting in the ISSES chamber was adjusted to recapitulate the light levels being experienced by the plants on orbit. Light measurements in the ISSES chamber were taken with the same iPad model and operating system (iPad3, iOS 5.1.1) used on the ISS, with the “Light Meter HD- lux measurement tool” application.Sample preparation for transcriptomics Seedlings preserved in RNAlater were removed from -80°C storage and then allowed to thaw at 4°C. The focus of the current study was restricted to the organ defined by the root tip, which was defined as the last 2mm of the root for the light-grown plants and the last 1mm for the dark-grown plants. The root tips were dissected from the intact plant roots while remaining submerged in RNAlater, and kept at or below 4°C until RNA extractions. Three independent roots were used as biological replicates for the transcriptomic analysis. Dissected root tips were transferred into pre-labeled micro-centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA extracted using the Picopure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus®, Life technologies). RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit platform (Thermo Fisher/Life Technologies, Inc) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Five ng RNA from each sample was used for RNA sequencing. Sequencing experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) gene expression and sequencing core, University of Florida. Initial data analysis was performed at the ICBR bioinformatics core, University of Florida.Library preparation and Illumina sequencing RNASeq libraries preparation using SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing combined with Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit Five ng of total RNA was used for each cDNA library construction using the CloneTech SMART-Seq V4 ultra low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc, cat#: 634890) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, first strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide and then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switched templates and continued transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting in full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence, which served as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 9 PCR cycles. Then Illumina sequencing libraries were generated with 120 pg of cDNA using Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC-131-1024) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 120 pg of cDNA was used as input for the Nextera tagmentation reaction (fragmentation and tagging) and then adapter sequences added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by Bioanalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Finally, the libraries were pooled equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2X75 NextSeq 500.NextSeq500 sequencing: RNA seq In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer, and quantified by QUBIT and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This working pool was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part # 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density (approximately 200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on three flowcells, using a 2x75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750–800 million paired-end read with a Q30> = 85%. For RNA seq, around 40 million reads provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.Mapping reads to genome data, annotated transcripts, and profiling of gene expression The paired end reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana var. Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software [35]. Multi-step process of transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis was done using the Cufflinks tool [36]. Reads that map to each transcript were counted and normalized based on fragment length and total reads. Normalized counts were expressed in terms of FPKM values (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments). FPKM is directly proportional to abundance of the transcript. The expression data were generated at a False Discovery Rate = 0.05 (FDR). At this FDR, a total of 33,999 genes were tested.Cluster analyses and genome annotation The cluster analyses used in all heatmaps were generated with GeneE (https://software.broadinstitute.org/GENE-E/). The clusters were generated using only genes that were assigned Atg numbers and called significant by the cuffdiff analysis (FDR 0.05), and were differentially expressed by at least two-fold (+/- 1 log2). For each cluster analysis, genes that showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison were sorted according to their Atg numbers and hierarchical clustering using Jaccard distance. Genes with a differential expression value of less than two-fold, and genes that have an FDR > 0.05 are depicted in gray. The fold-change color scale on the heatmaps ranges from -3 log2 (down 8-fold) to +3 log2 (up 8-fold). Genes with a differential expression value greater than 8-fold will be depicted with the same hue as for an 8-fold change. Gene annotations and functional relationships we obtained through ATTED-II (http://atted.jp/) [37].Availability of data The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, Series GSE94983 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94983). In addition, the gene expression data and spaceflight-relevant metadata are deposited with NASA’s GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120).Results Plant growth and development in the open ISS habitat In contrast to the focused lighting and environmentally controlled habitat used in the APEX01 experiment [18, 38], the CARA Petri plates were deployed to a wall inside the Destiny module of the ISS, where they received just the ambient, low level, indirect lighting of the module. It was not possible to completely eliminate all lighting gradients, as the surface of the Petri plate mounted on the wall (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber for the ground controls) will naturally not receive ambient light through the surface flush to the wall. The plates also received the ambient cabin air, temperature and humidity (Fig 1A). The design of the experiment included a set of light-grown plates and dark-grown plates, with three replicate plates of each genotype (WS, Col-0 and phyD) in each condition. All of the plates were configured to keep the seeds in a dormant state until integration on the ISS, a process that included protecting the seeds from light with black cloth wrappings [34]. Thus, the first action of the astronaut was to expose all of the plates to light to activate germination (Fig 1A) and then to re-wrap the dark-grown plates in light-proof cloth (Fig 1B). Identical procedures were initiated in the comparable ground controls grown in the ISSES chamber (Fig 1C and 1D).Development without clear directional cues The developmental progress of plant growth was followed through a series of photographs taken by the attending astronaut on the ISS, and by the attending technician at KSC, providing an independent “pseudonaut” on the ground in order to mimic astronaut activities on the ISS. The photographs in Fig 2 show representative images that compared the progress of growth after 3d, 6d and 9d for each genotype. The photographs were taken through the back of each plate. The region of interest was cropped from each astronaut-captured photograph to better display the progress of plant development. The full, uncropped, photographs are deposited in the NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120). The spaceflight-grown plants are shown in the left-hand column (Flight). Fig 2. A comparison of the growth of the three genotypes in the light at 3 days, 6 days and 9 days. Open in a new tab (A) The three panels in the left hand column show representative examples of Arabidopsis seedlings at 3, 6 and 9 days of growth on the ISS (Flight). (B) The three panels in the right hand column show representative examples of Arabidopsis seedlings at 3, 6 and 9 days of growth in the ISSES chamber for the ground controls (Ground). The images are taken through the back of the plate to minimize interference from condensation on the lid. The full set of uncropped Flight and Ground Control images can be found in the NASA GeneLab archives (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120).In spaceflight, the diffuse light elicited root growth that was primarily perpendicular to the orientation of vegetative growth, in that the hypocotyls were growing away from the surface of the media, and the roots grew in coils along the surface of the solid media of the plate. This configuration of plant growth closely resembles patterns seen in plates grown horizontally on the ground (Phytagel surface parallel to Earth’s surface). However, unlike horizontal growth in a unit gravity environment, the root coils were loose and somewhat unorganized. In contrast, the roots of the ground control plants shown in the right-hand column (Ground) grew in a clear, positively gravitropic manner along the surface of the plate media. As described in the Methods section, the ground control plates were oriented vertically (Phytagel surface perpendicular to the Earth’s surface), a growth configuration that encourages root growth along the surface of the Phytagel in a reasonably straight, positively geotropic manner. The hypocotyls were generally oriented in a negatively geotropic manner, but were also angled away from the less well-lit surface of the plate adjacent to the wall, towards the relatively lighter environment of the room. These types of spaceflight growth patterns are distinctly different from what has been seen in the high-light plant growth hardware of Veggie [39] and the strong, directional lighting of the ABRS hardware [18, 19]. The developmental image series in Fig 2 shows that both the spaceflight (left column) and ground control (right column) plants of all three genotypes were virtually identical in terms of apparent health, vigor, and developmental age within each environment. However, due to the rather dim lighting environment, neither the light-grown spaceflight nor light-grown ground control plants had the developmental appearance Arabidopsis plants of comparable ages grown in the more optimal lighting regimes of the ABRS and Veggie plant growth habitats [18, 19, 39]. Final photographs of the plants were taken after 11 days of growth, and then the plants were harvested to KFTs (Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes) containing RNAlater. Fig 3 shows the photographs taken just prior to harvest. These photographs were taken from the front surface with the plate lid removed. The light-grown plants are shown in Fig 3A. The 11 day spaceflight seedlings (Flight) are shown on the left, and the comparable ground controls (Ground) are shown on the right. The dark-grown plants are shown in Fig 3B, again with the spaceflight grown plants on the left, and the ground controls on the right. There are some minor morphological differences in the manner in which the different genotypes grow, but these differences in coiling and skewing are well characterized features of each genotype, and consistent with morphometric evaluations from previous spaceflight experiments (e.g. [18, 40, 41]). Fig 3. Growth and development of each genotype at the time of harvest. Open in a new tab (A) The three panels in the left hand column show representative examples of seedlings just prior to harvest after 11 days of growth on the ISS in the light. The three panels in the right hand column show representative examples of seedlings just prior to harvest after 11 days of growth in the ground control ISSES chamber in the light. (B) The three panels in the left hand column show representative examples of seedlings just prior to harvest after 11 days of growth on the ISS in the dark. The three panels in the right hand column show representative examples of seedlings just prior to harvest after 11 days of growth in the ground control ISSES chamber in the dark. The full set of uncropped Flight and Ground control images can be found in the NASA LSDA archives (link TBD).All three genotypes were healthy on orbit as judged by appearance in the photographs of Fig 3, and all three genotypes were equally productive on orbit as determined by analysis of root length in Fig 4. These observations suggest that regardless of the gene expression changes among these genotypes, all three were equally able to adapt to spaceflight. Root length was chosen as a key, quantifiable trait for plant productivity in light-grown plants; root length has been associated with plant health and crop success [42], and the photos taken on the ISS provide clear resolution of root growth. Fig 4 compares the root length of each genotype in both spaceflight and ground control environments derived from the images. Root measurements were made using ImageJ, and the data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares to compare the independent variables of genotype and environment [40, 43]. When grown in the light, only WS grown on the ground was significantly different from any other combination of genotype and environment (F2,310 = 12.112, p<0.001), WS, Col-0 and phyD were not different from each other with regards to root length in spaceflight. Fig 4. The root lengths among genotypes grown on orbit were not significantly different from one another. Open in a new tab The box for each genotype/treatment combination contains a line indicating the median, and an \"x\" indicating the mean. Above each box is a designation of the results of Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference, following the two-way ANOVA, where shared letters indicate insignificant difference. Only one of the six sample sets (WS.GC) was different from the other five.Genotype matters in spaceflight transcriptional responses The transcriptional response that each genotype mounted in their respective environments was very distinct. The Venn diagrams of Fig 5 provide an overview of the Spaceflight to Ground root-tip transcriptome comparisons of each genotype; values from light-grown plants are shown in Fig 5A, and dark-grown plants in Fig 5B. The size of the Venn circles are to scale with respect to the numbers of differentially expressed genes. The genes that comprise the list show at least a two-fold change (-1<log2<1) with FDR<0.05. The greatest difference in the transcriptomes of spaceflight and ground control plants was seen in light-grown Col-0 plants, with a total of 297 genes. The spaceflight to ground differences in the other two light-grown genotypes were a total of 130 in phyD, and then only 71 in the WS genotype. A fourth (18/71) of the WS differentially expressed genes were also coordinately expressed in the other two genotypes. Almost all (6/7) of the coordinately expressed genes that were downregulated compared to the ground controls were associated with light signaling. In the upregulated genes, about half (6/11) were associated with plant defense or cell wall metabolism. Fig 5. A Venn diagram displaying the distribution of coordinately expressed genes in response to spaceflight in all three genotypes. Open in a new tab (A) Coordinately expressed genes in the root tips of light-grown plants. (B) Coordinately expressed genes in the root tips of dark-grown plants. Coordinately expressed genes common to all three genotypes are annotated below each diagram. The number of differentially expressed genes associated with cell wall processes are indicated as black dots within each representative sector of the diagram. The small number (11 in the light and 17 in the dark) of significantly expressed genes that are represented in two genotypes, but were changed in opposite directions (up in one genotype while down in the other), are not included in the enumerations of coordinately expressed genes in the Venn diagrams.In the dark-grown plants, the distribution of differentially expressed genes between spaceflight and ground is quite different than was seen in the light-grown plants. In the dark, the WS and Col-0 cultivars showed roughly the same number of differentially expressed genes (218 and 224, respectively. In the dark, phyD exhibited the fewest differentially expressed genes (131). There were fewer coordinately expressed genes common to all genotypes (only 11). The single down regulated gene was associated with methionine biosynthesis, and two of the 10 upregulated genes have been associated with plant defense or cell wall metabolism. Among the three genotypes, 129 genes were differentially expressed in both the light and the dark (Supporting S1 Table). However, only one gene was coordinately expressed in both the light and the dark in all three genotypes: ATARD3 (AT2G26400—Acireductone Dioxygenase 3). There were also a small number of genes that while overlapping in significant, differential expression between genotypes, rather than being coordinately expressed they were changed in the opposite direction. These genes (11 in the light and 17 in the dark) are not included among the genes represented in the Venn Diagram of Fig 5. Genes associated with cell wall metabolism seemed prevalent among the differentially expressed genes. In order to create a standardized evaluation of the number of genes representing cell wall associated process, the differentially expressed gene sets used in Fig 5 were cross-referenced with two cell wall databases: the Purdue University Cell Wall Related Gene Families data sets (https://cellwall.genomics.purdue.edu/families/index.html) [44] and the SUBcellular localization database for Arabidopsis proteins (SUBA3—http://suba3.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/) [45]. Genes were considered as cell wall associated if they were identified as such in either database. For graphic visualization, the numbers of genes identified with these comparisons are indicated as black dots within each Venn section in Fig 5. In addition, each gene ID number is identified with bold text and gold highlighting in the fully annotated Supplementary S2 and S3 Tables.Transcriptional responses between flight and ground The genes enumerated in the Venn diagram of Fig 5 are shown as transcriptome heat-maps in Fig 6, in order to illustrate the distribution of differential expression among the genotypes along with fold-change. Fig 6 presents two sets of transcriptome heat maps that compare the patterns of gene expression between spaceflight and the equivalent ground controls for each genotype in the Light (Fig 6A) and in the Dark (Fig 6B). The heat maps were generated with GeneE software, utilizing statistically significant (FDR<0.05) expressed genes with differential expression of at least two-fold (-1<log2<1) in at least one comparison. The genes were sorted by Atg number, and hierarchical clustering was established using Jaccard distance. Each row of the heat map within each treatment (6A and 6B, respectively) corresponds to the same gene within each genotype. Significantly down regulated genes are indicated in green and significantly upregulated are in red. Genes depicted as gray did not meet either the fold-change or FDR criteria within that genotype. The gene rows are not collinear between 6A and 6B, but each heat map is presented to the same vertical scale. In the light, there were a total of 394 genes that were significantly, differentially expressed by at least two-fold in at least one genotype, and in the dark there were 461. Both the Light and Dark heat maps are annotated with the gene ID for selected cell wall-associated genes represented in the clusters of genes unique to a single genotype. The fully annotated heat maps can be found in Supporting S2 Table (FLT vs GC–Light) and Supporting S3 Table (FLT vs GC–Dark). In the Supporting tables, gene entries that have been associated with the cell wall (criteria described above) are indicated in bold text, and the gene ID number has been highlighted in gold. Fig 6. Arabidopsis root tip transcriptome heat maps showing differential expression between environments: Spaceflight compared to ground controls. Open in a new tab The spaceflight to ground control heat maps in either the light (A) or the dark (B) are presented to the same scale. Red indicates upregulated and green indicates down regulated. Any gene indicated with a color is statistically significant (FDR<0.05) and expressed to a level of at least 2-fold (-1 <log2> 1). The color scale ranges from -3 log2 (down 8-fold) to +3 log2 (up 8-fold). Genes with a differential expression value greater than 8-fold are presented in the same hue as for an 8-fold change. Heat maps are annotated with selected cell wall associated genes that are unique to each genotype. The total number of genes represented in the heat maps are indicated below each map. The fully annotated heat maps are provided in Supporting S2 Table.In the light, the physiological adaptation of cultivar WS to the spaceflight environment required the fewest number of changes in gene expression, while cultivar Col-0 required about five times as many changes in gene expression. The mutation of the PhyD gene in Col-0 resulted in an almost 3-fold reduction in the number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight. As presented in the Venn Diagrams of Fig 5, there were very few genes that were coordinately expressed among all three genotypes, and differentially expressed genes held in common between even two genotypes were also scarce. The differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those differentially expressed genes that were shared with another genotype. In the light, the upregulated differentially expressed genes unique to WS were largely associated with the cell wall, and processes in root hairs, including pathogen responses and development. The unique downregulated genes largely encoded transporters, along with several associated with plant defense, abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling. The over 200 uniquely expressed genes of Col-0 represented a wide range of diverse functions; defense, oxidative stress, cell wall metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress, and hormone signaling, and were well represented in both up and down regulated genes. The uniquely expressed genes of the Col-0 phyD mutant also encoded a similar diversity of gene categories, however phyD did not express the same representative genes from these categories, and there were fewer representatives of genes associated with stress responses in phyD. All three genotypes uniquely expressed about the same proportion of genes associated with the cell wall, with values ranging between 14% and 17%. In the dark, WS and Col-0 exhibited about the same total number of differentially expressed genes for the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. About 20% were coordinately expressed in both cultivars, but the types of genes that are coordinately expressed do not appear to represent a substantially different category of genes than those which are uniquely expressed in each genotype. In the dark, phyD exhibited the smallest number of differentially expressed genes among the three genotypes, and only about 15% were also differentially expressed in Col-0. In the dark, although many genes were again associated with defense, oxidative stress, and cell wall metabolism, there were also more genes associated with hormone metabolism (auxin, ABA and GA), and gravitropism than were seen in the light. Again, all three genotypes uniquely expressed about the same proportion of genes associated with the cell wall, with values ranging between 14% and 16%. The transcriptomic differences exhibited by the different genotypes in response to spaceflight are underscored by the transcriptome differences between the genotypes in any given environment. Fig 7 shows the extent of how the transcriptomic responses of each genotype varied from each other when grown on the ground or in spaceflight. Pair-wise comparisons are shown between Col-0 and phyD, Col-0 and WS, and then phyD and WS; each within the four different environments: lighted environment on the ground, lighted environment in spaceflight, dark environment on the ground, and dark environment in spaceflight. In the light, there are fewer differences among genotypes in the ground controls than in spaceflight, whereas in the dark, there are more differences among genotypes on the ground than in spaceflight. The fully annotated heat maps can be found in Supporting S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 Tables. Fig 7.

The fully annotated heat maps are provided in Supporting S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 Tables.Discussion Plants in spaceflight differentially express genes compared to their ground controls, suggesting that physiological adaptation is taking place in plants on orbit. There have now been a number of transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons of Arabidopsis and other plants grown in spaceflight environments [19, 23, 38, 46–57] and the topic of plant growth in space has been recently reviewed [58–63]. In addition, there is more to growing in an orbital environment than the simple removal of gravity. Transcriptome comparisons of plants growing in artificial gravity environments generated by a centrifuge on the ISS illustrates that simply returning some form of gravity to the spaceflight environment does not completely ameliorate the transcriptional and proteomic response [51, 64, 65]. The general consensus from these studies is that while there is no single set of genes that are representative hallmarks of growth in the spaceflight environment, most plants do appear to differentially express genes associated with several consistent categories of genes. Genes associated with cell wall remodeling, cell polarity, and ROS signaling predominate, but the exact same genes are not utilized among all plants, plant organs, and experiments. Indeed there is no obvious consensus of what a canonical spaceflight response might be in plants or among plant cells, except perhaps for these categories of genes rather than specific genes. Although root growth patterns were distinct between spaceflight and ground control plants, all three genotypes were developmentally comparable to the ground control plants. (Figs 2 and 3) and all three genotypes were equally productive in terms of root length in spaceflight. However, the molecular means to effect the physiological adaptation necessary to achieve comparable growth in the spaceflight environment was highly dependent on the genotype. Each genotype used almost completely different sets of genes to physiologically adapt their metabolism to the lighted environment of the ISS, and the number of differentially expressed genes was dramatically different among the genotypes. While Col-0 differentially expressed 297 genes to accomplish its physiological adaptation, WS accomplished adaptation with only 71 differentially expressed genes. Plants of the phyD mutant of Col-0 differentially expressed 127 genes. If differential gene expression is a measure of the degree or cost of the physiological adaptive response, then WS would be considered more highly spaceflight adapted than Col-0 and the phyD mutation would be considered a spaceflight adaptive mutation in Col-0 background. In other words, much of the Col-0 spaceflight response can be eliminated with a simple mutation in PhyD, without apparently compromising plant health or development or adding stress responses at the gene expression level. Indeed, the phyD plants did not appear to be at any disadvantage with respect to root navigation on orbit, where light is the primary tropic cue, nor did the phyD spaceflight transcriptome suggest a disruption of light-mediated signaling. Rather, relieving Col-0 of the gene encoding PhyD appeared to lighten the demands on the processes engaged to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. The converting the genome to WS further lightened the adaptive demands at the transcriptome level. The data in Fig 5 further suggest that much of the differential gene expression exhibited by all three genotypes in the light of the ISS is non adaptive, or at least dispensable. For example, out of the 297 differentially expressed genes in Col-0, 217 of them appear dispensable, as neither phyD nor WS shared those differential gene expressions. Moreover, these three genotypes shared only 18 genes with similar differential gene expression patterns. This suggests the possibility that most of the gene expression responses in these genotypes, in these cells, were not fundamentally required for physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to spaceflight. The 18 coordinately expressed genes shared amongst the genotypes may well present two categories of adaptive metabolism that are universally important to growing in a spaceflight environment (Fig 5). The seven down-regulated genes in this set have all been associated with light signal transduction, whereas most of the eleven up-regulated genes have been associated with plant defense responses. These genes represent two strong trends seen throughout these data as well as other published transcriptomic responses of plants in spaceflight: modified light signal transduction and modified cell wall metabolism. Overall, the transcriptome responses for all three genotypes were enriched in these two categories, as well as for oxidative stress, genes associated with auxin, ABA and GA signaling, and general abiotic stress. The prevalence of representatives from these categories among the highly differentially expressed genes in all three genotypes could suggest that the adaptive process was generally the same for all three genotypes. However, the difference in the total numbers of differentially expressed genes among the genotypes could suggest that some genotypes expended far less effort to achieve a comparable adaptive metabolism. Plants germinated and then grown in the dark on the ISS present a similar conclusion, although with different genes and differing numbers of gene expression changes. The phyD mutant differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0, and only 11 genes were similarly differentially expressed among Col-0, phyD and WS. As was also seen in the light-grown plants, most of the differentially expressed genes of any particular genotype grown in the dark can be eliminated without affecting the ability to grow on the ISS. It is important to note that the 18 genes shared among the differentially expressed genes of all three genotypes in the light of the ISS are almost completely distinct from the 11 shared differentially expressed genes of the dark grown ISS plants; only one gene, ATARD3, is common to both sets (Fig 5). ATARD3 has not been well characterized in the literature, but the gene has been loosely associated with pathogen response [66, 67] and cell wall metabolism [68]. Thus, in this experiment with three genotypes and two different ISS environments, there is only one universally differentially expressed gene in the root tips of spaceflight plants, and this gene is not represented in previously identified spaceflight transcriptomes. Therefore these data appear inconsistent with the concept that there is a basic required adaptive response to spaceflight that would be common among all plant cells and in under all conditions.Conclusions The primary conclusion of this work is that much of the plant response to spaceflight is potentially non-adaptive in that at least most of the gene expression responses could be genetically eliminated without overtly compromising growth in space. This suggests that responses to truly novel environments may include responses from signals that are inappropriately activated or misinterpreted, and further suggests that these inappropriate responses can be genetically eliminated without adverse consequences. For spaceflight in particular, these data suggest that genetic manipulation can produce varieties that are better adapted to growth in spaceflight through elimination of unnecessary responses. A secondary conclusion of this work is that there is no fundamental spaceflight response that characterizes plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Rather, the adaptive response is dependent upon the genotype of the plant and the specific environment within which it grows. The response also appears highly organ specific, as roots and leaves share few spaceflight differential genes in common [38, 47]. And yet, it remains possible and even likely that classes of differentially expressed genes will continue to be shared amongst cell types, genotypes and environments in space. However there is no overt indication that specific genes will be differentially expressed in all spaceflight plants. These conclusions lie in sharp contrast to evolutionarily defined and well characterized terrestrial stress responses. Heat shock, cold shock, salt, pathogen attack and other stresses show commonality of differential expression across cell types and local environments. HSPs are HSPs in all plant cells. Since no such commonality exists in spaceflight responses, it appears that at least large portions of the spaceflight responses in plants are not necessary, and therefore can be eliminated without negative impact on plant life in spaceflight and opening the possibility of selecting plant genotypes optimized for spaceflight growth. The differential expression of categories of genes, rather than individual genes, exhibited in the overall plant spaceflight response could be interpreted as support for the notion that certain categories of responses are either necessary for spaceflight physiological adaptation, or a common consequence of interpreting this novel environment. A common theme that appears to remain consistent among plant spaceflight transcriptomes is that of cell wall remodeling. Genes encoding proteins associated with cell wall remodeling have characterized the spaceflight response among several experiments and genotypes [23, 38, 47, 48, 51, 52, 56, 57, 65]. Cell wall remodeling genes are represented in the differentially expressed genes are richly represented in this experiment as well (Fig 6, Supporting S2 and S3 Tables). Thus cell wall remodeling appears to be, for the most part, a requirement or an unavoidable consequence of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Yet the differential gene expression that characterizes that response may be highly cell, genotype and environment specific, and indeed may not actually be required for successful adaptation. Future experiments can be directed to establishing the minimal responses to spaceflight by further mutational and environmental manipulations, and can thereby contribute to systems engineering of spaceflight habitats. Plant growth in actual life support functions within space exploration is an important technical engineering challenge. Growing plants on petri plates allows what is likely the most benign growth system possible in spaceflight absent artificial gravity. Water management is not necessary, as the Phytagel provides water to the roots without potential flooding that can be seen in larger scale plant production systems on orbit or within exploration vehicles. Light and air management is quite similar to situations in terrestrial laboratories. It is quite possible that more stress responses will be seen in larger plant growth units on orbit, where water, nutrient and air management become more of an issue than for plants grown on plates. Engineering solutions to those issues can draw upon these plants-on-plates to better understand achievable stress reduction goals.Supporting information S1 Table.

The T-DNA insertion is found within exon one of the AT1G05290 gene, however a homozygous T-DNA allele is unattainable. In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia). Further analyses revealed an aberrant silique phenotype found in the heterozygous SALK_063500 plants that is attributed to the reduced rate of pollen tube germination.

Experimental design, materials and methods Arabidopsis seeds of wild type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and SALK_063500 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center [1]. Plants were grown in the growth chambers on soil at 22 °C under constant light at approaximately 80 μmol m−2 s−1. In the search for a homozygous T-DNA insertion line from SALK_063500, over a thousand progeny of the heterozygous SALK_063500 line were screened and 110 are presented in Fig. 1B. AT1G05290-LP and AT1G05290-RP primers were used to amplify the wild type allele band (991 bp) while LBa1 and AT1G05290-RP primers were used to amplify the T-DNA band (440–740 bp). No homozygous T-DNA allele lines were found. For gene expression analysis, Col-0 and SALK_063500 seeds were grown on 0.5% PhytagelTM plates (0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts [Invitrogen] containing 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, was adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1N KOH and solidified with 0.5% (w/v) PhytagelTM [Sigma]) at 22 °C under constant light condition [2]. The 12 day old plants were harvested from Phytagel plates and directly preserved in RNALater [Ambion] until ready for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kits [Qiagen] according to the manufacturer's instructions. CDNA was transcribed from total RNA, using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit [Applied Biosystems] and RT-qPCR analysis was conducted with SYBR Green master mix [Applied Biosystems]. The 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative expression of At1g05290 using UBQ11 (AT4G0505) as an internal control. A total of 6 replicates were used for each sample. For silique phenotypes, 30 siliques from three individuals representing the genotype were collected, imaged under the Olympus stereo dissecting microscope (SZH10) and measured using image J [3], [4]. For in vitro pollen germination studies, mature pollen was harvested from flowers left at room temperate for 2 h, and then grown overnight on slides coated with solid pollen germinating media (18% Sucrose, 0.01% Boric Acid, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.5% Noble agar [Difco] was adjusted to pH 7.0 [5]. Pollen germination studies done in vivo were performed by collecting pollinated pistils 6 h after pollination and briefly fixed in ethanol:acetic acid (3:1) for 2 h at room temperature. Fixed pistils were then washed with distilled water three times and further treated in 8 M NaOH overnight. Pistil tissues were then washed in distilled water and stained with aniline blue solution (0.1% aniline blue in 0.1 M K2HPO4-KOH buffer, pH 11) for 5 h in the dark before being viewed under the Olympus BX51 compound light microscope [6].Acknowledgements Authors would like to thank the UF Space Plants lab.

    "abstract": "Abstract Premise of the Study An imaging system was refined to monitor the health of vegetation grown in controlled conditions using spectral reflectance patterns. To measure plant health, the single‐image normalized difference vegetation index (SI‐NDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and near‐infrared light spectrums.Methods and Results The SI‐NDVI imaging system was characterized to assess plant responses to stress before visual detection during controlled stress assays. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress.Conclusions Stress was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within 15 min of salinity application using SI‐NDVI analysis, before stress was visible. Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment of Eruca sativa plants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SI‐NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dual‐image NDVI or hyper‐spectral imaging.Keywords: early stress detection, imaging, plant health monitoring, vegetation index",

Copyright notice ID: 6201722 PMID: 30386712 Abstract Premise of the Study An imaging system was refined to monitor the health of vegetation grown in controlled conditions using spectral reflectance patterns. To measure plant health, the single‐image normalized difference vegetation index (SI‐NDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and near‐infrared light spectrums.Methods and Results The SI‐NDVI imaging system was characterized to assess plant responses to stress before visual detection during controlled stress assays. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress.Conclusions Stress was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within 15 min of salinity application using SI‐NDVI analysis, before stress was visible. Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment of Eruca sativa plants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SI‐NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dual‐image NDVI or hyper‐spectral imaging.Keywords: early stress detection, imaging, plant health monitoring, vegetation index The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has become a standard for vegetation and crop health assessment. NDVI, and NDVI‐like methods, have been used for decades by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observatory to monitor global vegetation health (Rouse et al., 1973; Tucker and Choudhury, 1987). More recently, NDVI has been adapted for use in fields and greenhouses growing crops under natural sunlight (reviewed in Yengoh et al., 2014). Indoor farming is being increasingly relied upon to grow crops in unfavorable environments such as urban areas, areas of extreme temperature, and eventually to support the expansion of human life off‐planet. Because of the completely closed environment of an indoor farm, the early and rapid correction of abiotic stressors such as salt imbalance, low water content, nitrate concentration, and high pH is essential to maintaining plant health and advancing indoor farming applications. Traditional NDVI technology is not ideal for use in indoor farming scenarios because growing crops indoors relies upon fully controlled, artificial lighting for plant growth (Specht et al., 2014). Traditional artificial light sources used to grow crops in controlled conditions focus on optimizing photosynthesis. The use of artificial lighting containing near‐infrared (NIR) wavelengths enables NDVI‐like evaluations of plants in closed environments. This article demonstrates that NDVI analysis in controlled container environments is an applicable and useful tool in plant health monitoring. Controlled plant stress assays are used to validate the ability of modified NDVI imaging to detect evidence of stress before visual detection. To demonstrate the diverse applications of this approach, two different stress treatments were tested, two different plant species were assayed, and two different growth mediums were utilized. This work refined an alternate version of the commonly used equation for NDVI, single‐image NDVI (SI‐NDVI), to make early plant stress detection in controlled conditions utilizing NIR and full‐spectrum visible light worthwhile to growers. NDVI is traditionally calculated as a ratio of the spectral reflectance patterns of plant leaves in both the red (590–670 nm) and NIR (700–1100 nm) bands using the equation: NDVI=(NIR−Red)/(NIR+Red)(Yengoh et al.,2014) In contrast, SI‐NDVI relies on comparison between spectral reflectance in the blue and NIR bands using the equation: SI‐NDVI=(NIR−Blue)/(NIR+Blue) Typically, two sensors are needed for NDVI analysis: one to record red light reflectance, and a second to record NIR reflectance (Rouse et al., 1973; Tucker and Choudhury, 1987). After image capture, precise optical alignment of the two images is then necessary to calculate NDVI. Cameras developed for SI‐NDVI employ a dual bandpass filter such that the single red, green, and blue (RGB) image can be manipulated into a differential image. The dual bandpass filter blocks green, yellow, orange, and red light while allowing blue and NIR light to pass through, repurposing the function of the red channel of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor for NIR. NDVI analysis requires comparison between a portion of the visible light spectrum and the NIR spectrum. For SI‐NDVI, blue light reflectance, as opposed to red light reflectance, is utilized to represent the normalizing portion of the visible light spectrum while the dual bandpass filter lets the red channel of the CMOS sensor record NIR. This modification enables SI‐NDVI analysis using only a single image after parsing the red and blue signals from the image sensor and thus avoids the technically challenging optical alignment process. Implementation of the SI‐NDVI imaging system enables early stress detection in plants while remaining both cost effective and user friendly. Cost efficiency is due in part to the fact that computer software required for SI‐NDVI analysis is open source and easily accessible. SI‐NDVI analysis allows for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of plant health in controlled environments, thereby making it applicable to lay persons as well as scientists. Qualitative data analysis utilizes Fiji (or ImageJ; Schindelin et al., 2012), a completely free open source program that is used to produce false color images and color index maps. For quantitative analysis, Excel spreadsheet software (Excel 2010 version 14.0.7212.5000 [64‐bit]; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) is used to track SI‐NDVI color index trends over time. Additional cost savings in this system are based on the lowering cost of commercially available cameras that can be modified for this use, in comparison to the high price of hyper‐spectral imagers. METHODS AND RESULTS A detailed benchside protocol for development and use of the SI‐NDVI imager in controlled plant stress assays is available in Appendix 1. Camera and camera settings A GoPro Hero4 Black camera (GoPro Inc., San Mateo, California, USA) was retrofitted with a Back‐Bone Ribcage AIR modification kit (Back‐Bone Gear Inc., Ottawa, Canada) to create the SI‐NDVI imager (Fig. 1). This camera contains a 12‐megapixel (MP; 4000 × 3000 pixel) CMOS optical sensor. The Back‐Bone system allows for the removal of the internal infrared blocking filter and addition of the ability to accept varied lenses. The lens used in this study is an M12 5.4‐mm MP‐10 with infrared correction. A single‐filter lens with dual bandpass was added (NDVI‐7; IRpro, Brea, California, USA) that allowed light to transmit in the 400–575‐nm range and the 675–775‐nm range. The quality of the images taken can be varied based on intrinsic camera setting options, which include 5 MP, 7 MP, and 12 MP. Camera settings were kept consistent and calibrated to produce the most meaningful data for a given experiment. The Protune settings, optimized for use in our work, on the GoPro Hero4 Black camera were as follows: white balance = 6500 K, color = flat, ISO min = 100, ISO max = 100, sharpness = high, and EV comp = 0.0. These settings produced the images that provided greatest manipulation options in data analysis. It should be noted that it is important to manually lock the white balance and color settings, instead of using autocorrect settings, to prevent discrepancies between images in downstream analysis.

(C) The M12 5.4‐mm MP‐10 with infrared correction lens used in this study.Lighting A Heliospectra LX300 lighting system (Heliospectra AB, Göteborg, Sweden) was used for all SI‐NDVI imaging. This system allows for application of 450 nm (blue), 660 nm (red), 735 nm (far red/NIR), and 5700 K (white) LEDs. Additionally, each of the LED light spectra is individually adjustable with this system, thus maximizing customizability. For all experiments in this report, NIR (735 nm) and blue light (450 nm) were supplied to the plant tissue. The exact composition of light wavelengths used (as recorded by an external spectrometer) is provided in a spectral graph (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Spectral graph demonstrating composition of light wavelengths used in this study for single‐image normalized difference vegetation index (SI‐NDVI) analysis. This exact light spectrum was obtained utilizing a customizable controlled lighting source allowing for application of both near‐infrared and blue light to plant tissue. Spectral readings taken from under a typical fluorescent growth light are provided for comparison.Downstream image analysis 1: False color image production After image collection, the photographs from the SI‐NDVI imager can be analyzed qualitatively to produce false color images. Application of the Photo Monitoring plugin (Horning, 2012) of Fiji is used to begin the photo processing (Schindelin et al., 2012). The Photo Monitoring graphical user interface (GUI) allows for different options that can be optimized for user needs, including selection of channels for the NDVI equation (Horning, 2012). Selecting the blue channel in place of the traditionally used red band, and the red channel in place of the NIR band, enables the SI‐NDVI calculation. Proper channel selection in the Photo Monitoring GUI of Fiji is imperative to SI‐NDVI analysis using the NDVI‐7 filter because NIR reflectance is recorded in the red channel of the camera. The following SI‐NDVI equation will be applied to each individual pixel in the image of interest: SI‐NDVI=(NIR−Blue)/(NIR+Blue) To produce a false color image, a color index file must first be generated from the raw SI‐NDVI image. The color index file retains the SI‐NDVI score calculated for each individual pixel and divides the scores into 256 categories termed “color index values.” SI‐NDVI scores range from −1.0 to 1.0; therefore, each color index value category corresponds to an increment of 0.0078125 in SI‐NDVI scores. Using this increment system, a score of −1.0 will be categorized to color index value 0, a score of 0.0 to color index value 127, and a score of 1.0 to color index value 255. False color images are then generated by applying a color lookup table (LUT) to the color index file. LUTs are adjustable, artificially generated color scales that can be set to meet the needs of the user in terms of highlighting pixels with specific color index values in distinct colors. False color images are produced by using the following settings in the Photo Monitoring plugin when applying a LUT: select the option to stretch the NIR band before creating the index, then set the minimum index value for scaling color index image to −1.00 and the maximum to 1.00. Optimal visual presentation in the false color image is achieved through choice of LUT and the ability to optimize the balance and contrast between colors in any given LUT. Although selection of a color LUT impacts the aesthetic characteristics of a false color image, the selection of one LUT over another has no bearing on the categorization of pixel scores (Fig. 3). To demonstrate the ability to highlight pixels with high‐scoring color index values in varying colors, multiple LUTs were applied to an image of Nicotiana benthamiana Domin (Fig. 3D–F). For example, when using the “Jolly Green Cyant” LUT, a pixel with a score of −1.00 will be categorized to color index value 0 and colored white, whereas a pixel with a score of 1.00 will be categorized to color index value 255 and colored dark orange (Fig. 3F). For comparison, when using a different LUT such as “Physics,” a pixel with an SI‐NDVI score of −1.00 will similarly be categorized to color index value 0, but colored dark blue instead (Fig. 3E) (Horning, 2012). A variety of LUTs are included in the Photo Monitoring plugin upon initial download (Horning, 2012), and more are available online for download (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads). Additionally, users can design custom LUTs (Balor, 2004) such as the “NDVI Cyantific” and “Jolly Green Cyant” LUTs, which were specifically customized for this work (Fig. 3D, F, respectively; LUT files available in Appendices S1 and S2). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Application of lookup tables (LUTs) to a filtered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image for qualitative data analysis has no impact on quantitative analysis.

(C) Plot of the color index value for all pixels in the filtered image shown in panel B.

(F) Jolly Green Cyant LUT.Downstream image analysis 2: Graph representation of data In addition to false color images, the same SI‐NDVI image can be used to generate a graph that displays the number of pixels present at each pixel value. For graph production, the same channel settings are used as previously described in the process of generating false color images. To generate graphs with less background from non‐vegetative material, the settings in the Photo Monitoring GUI can be adjusted to highlight only vegetative data. This is accomplished by exclusively categorizing pixels with an SI‐NDVI score between 0.00 and 1.00, which is done by reducing the increment per color index value category to 0.00390625. All pixels with a score lower than 0.00 are categorized to color index value 0 using this approach. Categorized data are then graphed to examine the number of pixels that were assigned to each color index value (Figs. 3C, 4C–D, 5C–D). Additionally, pixels barely surviving the 0.00 cutoff (color index value 25 and below) are removed from the data set before graphing to focus exclusively on vegetative tissue. Larger color index values seen on the x‐axis reflect higher SI‐NDVI scores, whereas higher peaks indicate highly concentrated color index values as reflected on the y‐axis (Figs. 3C, 4C–D, 5C–D). Plant health or growth can then be studied by analyzing changes in the curve over time. Figure 4.

Arabidopsis thaliana salinity stress experiments Salt treatments of Arabidopsis Heynh. seedlings were used to demonstrate the potential of early stress detection using SI‐NDVI analysis. Sterilized wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia‐0 seeds were planted onto square 10‐cm2 Petri plates containing 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Media was prepared using 2.2 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 0.5 g of MES hydrate, 5.0 g of sucrose, 1.0 mL of Gamborg vitamins (Sigma‐Aldrich), and then adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1 M KOH. The media was solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma‐Aldrich). Seeds were sown in densities ranging from 18 to 36 seeds per Petri plate. For any individual experiment, plates containing the same density of seeds were used for experimental and control treatments. Petri plates were sealed with porous surgical 3M Micropore tape (3M, Maplewood, Minnesota, USA). Plants were grown for 10–19 d under 24‐h fluorescent growth lights. For any individual experiment, plates containing plants of the same age were used for the experimental and control treatments. At the start of the stress experiments, both control and treatment plates were acclimated to the Heliospectra LX300 lighting for 2–3 h before administering treatment. Both the SI‐NDVI imager and the normal white light camera were set up using tripods and scheduled to image the plants every 15 min for 24 h. After the acclimation period and the initial images were taken, stress or control treatments were applied to the plants. For the salt stress treatment, 7–10 mL of 3% salt water was applied to the Petri plate to flood the roots, taking care not to flood the leaves. For the control treatment, 7–10 mL of Millipore deionized water was applied to the roots. Plants treated with salt stress showed little difference to the naked eye 15 min after salt treatment was administered (Figs. 4, 6). However, in the SI‐NDVI images, stress is detectable in the plants given the salt treatment. After only 15 min of salt exposure, color changes are seen in the false color images of the salt‐stressed plants compared to the control plants (Fig. 4A, B). This decline in health could also be detected by quantitative image analysis, seen by the decrease in the number of pixels with a high color index value, correlating to a high SI‐NDVI score, in stressed plants compared to control plants over time (Fig. 4C, D). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Single‐image normalized difference vegetation index (SI‐NDVI) analysis is capable of repeatedly detecting statistically significant salt stress responses before visual detection. Pixel counts in color index values 115–125 from a total of eight ROI replicates were summed for the initial time point before treatment application, as well as 0.25, 1, 9, and 21 h after treatment. Color index values 115–125 correspond to the peak decrease in SI‐NDVI scores over time as seen in Fig. 4. Pictured below the graph are white light images of two single plants from a single replicate, chosen as visual representatives of the control or stress treatments. * indicates a statistically significant difference calculated by Student's t‐test (P < 0.05). C = control treatment; S = salt stress treatment.Statistical significance was calculated by cropping the images obtained from each replicate into smaller regions of interest (ROIs). For this experiment, eight ROIs were included in the calculation of significance from two biological replicates. The ROIs chosen were non‐overlapping to ensure that any individual plant was only included in a single ROI. Analysis as previously described for graph production was performed on each smaller ROI individually. After this analysis, the numbers of pixels assigned to color index values 115–125 were summed for each individual ROI. The summed pixel counts from all ROIs were then represented graphically using a box‐and‐whisker plot (Fig. 6), and two‐tailed Student's t‐tests assuming equal variances were calculated for comparison between control and stress treatments at each individual time point (Table 1). Statistics were calculated using both the data analysis tool in Excel and the t.test() function in R with identical results. Color index values 115–125 were chosen for statistical calculation because the primary decrease seen in color index values over time occurs in this range (as seen in Fig. 4C). At the initial time point, there was no statistically significant difference between the number of pixels assigned to color index values 115–125 in the control and salt stress treatment groups. After only 15 min of salt stress exposure, however, the number of pixels categorized to color index values 115–125 was significantly lower in the salt‐stressed plants than in the control treatments (Fig. 6). A single plant from both the control and salt stress treatments was chosen as a visual representative (Fig. 6). The background has been subtracted in the representative images for clarity. Table 1.

Eruca sativa ammonium nitrate stress experiments Ammonium nitrate treatments of E. sativa Mill. (arugula) plants on soil were used to demonstrate the potential of early stress detection in a more production‐related growth situation. Sterilized commercial arugula seeds (Arugula Myway no. 67165A; W. Atlee Burpee & Co., Warminster, Pennsylvania, USA) were sown on round, deep‐welled Petri plates 10 cm in diameter containing 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel prepared as described for the Arabidopsis seedlings. Arugula seeds were allowed to germinate on plates for 7 d before transplantation to sterile soil in six‐welled pots, with one arugula seedling transplanted per well. Arugula plants were exposed to 24‐h fluorescent growth lights both during germination on plates and growth on soil. Plants were allowed to grow for a total of 25 d before use for ammonium nitrate assays. Before application of the ammonium nitrate treatment, the arugula plants were allowed to acclimate to the Heliospectra LX300 lighting overnight. Both the SI‐NDVI imager and the normal white light camera were set up using tripods and scheduled to image the plants every 30 min for 3 d. After acclimation, an initial image was taken prior to administering stress or control treatments. Each six‐welled pot was placed in an individual plastic tray to contain treatment solutions. For both the treatment and control plants, 200 mL of solution was applied to each six‐welled pot by pouring the solution into the plastic tray and allowing the solution to reach the plant through the soil. For the ammonium nitrate treatment, 10× ammonium nitrate solution was utilized based on the recommended concentration of ammonium nitrate in basal Murashige and Skoog medium. For the control treatment, tap water was utilized. For several days after stress treatment, arugula plants subjected to the ammonium nitrate solution do not appear visibly stressed (Fig. 5A). Finally, after 60 h of exposure to the high ammonium nitrate concentration, the plants become noticeably wilted, whereas control plants look relatively unchanged (Fig. 5A, B). Despite the lack of change in the visual appearance of the ammonium nitrate–treated plants, SI‐NDVI quantitative analysis in comparison to control plants enables detection of a decrease in high scoring color index values, correlating to a decrease in healthy plant tissue, as early as 6 h after stress treatment (Fig. 5C, D). Analysis was done on a single leaf from five different arugula plants per treatment following the previously described method for graph production. For each time point analyzed, the color index value with the highest pixel count was recorded and termed the “peak color index value.” The peak color index value of each successive time point was then subtracted from the peak color index value at the initial time point before treatment application for each individual arugula leaf analyzed, and the difference was termed the “peak color index value change.” The color index value changes were then represented graphically in a box‐and‐whisker plot (Fig. 5E), and two‐tailed Student's t‐tests assuming equal variances were calculated on the peak color index value change at each time point (Table 2). Statistics were calculated using both the data analysis tool in Excel and the t.test() function in R with identical results. By 12 h of treatment exposure, the peak color index value change in the ammonium nitrate–treated plants was statistically significantly different from the peak color index value change in the control plants (Fig. 5E).

Peak color index value change refers to the difference between the color index value with the highest pixel count for a given time point and the color index value with the highest pixel count at the initial time point. CONCLUSIONS Compared to traditional NDVI or hyper‐spectral imaging approaches, the dollar cost of implementing an SI‐NDVI imaging system is low because SI‐NDVI requires only one camera and can rely on completely free, open source software for analysis. In addition, the implementation barriers within a laboratory setting or greenhouse facilities are essentially nonexistent. To optimize SI‐NDVI imaging to be similar to the historical NDVI applications, precise application of light in the blue and NIR spectrums can be supplied using controlled lighting (Fig. 2). In our study, this was accomplished through the use of programmable LED lighting. Alternatively, NDVI cameras have been developed to function in natural lighting, such as the smart NDVI camera developed by Dworak and colleagues (Dworak et al., 2013). This study demonstrated that SI‐NDVI imaging allows for detection of plant stress before it is apparent to the human eye, in controlled conditions using two of the many potential stresses that may be of interest in the laboratory or greenhouse. This work has demonstrated that the SI‐NDVI imaging system is capable of enabling detection of stress in Arabidopsis seedlings within 15 min of exposure to salt on agar plates (Figs. 4, 6) and in young arugula plants on soil within 6 h of exposure to high concentrations of ammonium nitrate. When cultivating crops in controlled conditions, it is especially desirable to detect stress early to improve the overall success rate of cultivation. SI‐NDVI imaging has clear applications in the development of indoor farming practices, which are increasingly relied upon to provide fresh food to geographical areas not conducive to crop cultivation, such as in urban cities or areas of extreme temperature. Additionally, SI‐NDVI imaging could potentially be used as a high‐throughput screening technique for identification of mutant phenotypes in controlled laboratory plant studies. Hence, the implementation of SI‐NDVI will likely improve the success of controlled greenhouse or laboratory growing efforts, and should be tested further. This work has characterized an SI‐NDVI response curve corresponding to salt‐stressed agar‐grown Arabidopsis seedlings and ammonium nitrate–stressed soil‐grown arugula plants. Future research should work toward characterizing SI‐NDVI phenotypes for additional plant stressors, species, and growth mediums. Furthermore, future work should address practical concerns associated with deploying the SI‐NDVI method in real‐world controlled crop cultivation efforts.Supporting information APPENDIX S1.

Creating a false color image from an SI‐NDVI image Download and install Fiji or ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads). Note: Fiji is a version of ImageJ that contains more pre‐installed plugins. For this application, either version will be sufficient. Download the Photo Monitoring Plugin jar file (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads). Manually copy the Photo_Monitoring executable jar file into the plugins folder created from the initial Fiji download. (Optional) Additional color lookup tables (LUTs) tailored for NDVI analyses can be downloaded and installed by manually copying the LUT file into the “luts” folder within the Photo Monitoring Plugin folder (https://github.com/nedhorning/PhotoMonitoringPlugin/tree/master/downloads). Note: The custom LUTs created for use in this work, named “NDVI Cyantific” and “Jolly Green Cyant” are available for download in Appendices S1 and S2. These can also be installed by manually copying the files into the “luts” folder within the Photo Monitoring Plugin folder. Open the ImageJ application from within the Fiji download folder; a graphical user interface (GUI) will open (Fig. Figure A1). Drag a raw image from the SI‐NDVI imager into the GUI. The GUI will display <<Drag and Drop>>. Open the Photo Monitoring plugin by clicking the “Plugins” tab on the GUI and finding the “Photo Monitoring” menu. Then select “Single Image Index Processing from Displayed Image” (Fig. Figure A2). A new GUI will open. For creating false color images, the settings options are shown below in Fig. Figure A3. Note: The option to “Select output color table for color index image” will designate which LUT is used to produce the false color image. This choice will not impact quantitative analysis. All LUTs downloaded and copied into the “luts” folder of the Photo Monitoring plugin will appear in this dropdown menu. Note: The settings used for graph production differ slightly and will be shown separately. Select OK once all settings have been verified. A false color image will now appear on the screen (Fig. Figure A4). This image can be saved in a variety of file formats from the “File” tab in the main GUI. Note: Balance and contrast may be adjusted for aesthetic purposes by clicking the “Image” tab in the GUI, and then using the options available from the “Adjust” menu.Graph production from an SI‐NDVI image Follow steps 1–6 of the “Creating a false color image from an SI‐NDVI image” section above. Once the new GUI opens (Fig. Figure A5), select the settings shown for graph production. Set the minimum index value for scaling color index to 0 and the maximum index value to 1.00 to focus exclusively on pixels corresponding to vegetation. Uncheck the box to “Stretch the NIR band before creating index” when producing graphs. Note: The option to “Select output color table for color index image” will dictate the LUT utilized to create the image. This has no effect on quantitative analysis. Select OK once all settings have been verified. A new false color image will appear (Fig. Figure A6). Navigate to the “Analyze” tab of the GUI. Select “Histogram” from the dropdown menu. A histogram window will now appear, as shown in Fig. Figure A6. Click “Copy” from within the histogram window. Open Microsoft Excel (we used Excel 2010 version 14.0.7212.5000 [64‐bit]; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) or any other spreadsheet program. Paste in the data copied from the histogram. The data from the histogram will be pasted as two columns, a sample is shown in Fig. Figure A7. The first column represents the 255 color index values the SI‐NDVI scores are categorized by, while the second column contains the total number of pixels from the image that fell within any given color index value. Pixel counts can then be utilized for graph production, and SI‐NDVI scores can be tracked over time. Figure Figure A1. Open in a new tab ImageJ Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Copyright notice ID: 6240453 PMID: 30473943 Abstract Premise of the Study The root apex is an important region involved in environmental sensing, but comprises a very small part of the root. Obtaining root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight.Methods Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth‐terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each was compared.Results Both microarrays and RNA‐Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA‐Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight‐relevant genes that were missed in RNA‐Seq.Discussion Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis using either RNA‐Seq or microarrays. Both RNA‐Seq and microarrays provided novel information. These data suggest that techniques for dealing with small, rare samples from spaceflight can be further enhanced, and that RNA‐Seq may miss some spaceflight‐relevant changes in gene expression.Keywords: differential expression, microarray, root apex, RNA‐Seq, transcriptome Spaceflight experiments often come with novel challenges compared to terrestrial projects, and chief among these are the stringent limits to the amount of material that can be launched (small sample size) and restricted on orbit resources (e.g., limited space or duration in growth habitats, limited crew time). These limitations often lead to constrained scientific return from those materials, making it particularly important to obtain maximum data from each sample. The primary focus of our research program is the evaluation of the complex responses of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. to the spaceflight environment. Plant root growth in microgravity exhibits skewing and waving behavior (Paul et al., 2012a), insightful patterns of phytohormone distribution in the primary root tips (Ferl and Paul, 2016), and distinct patterns of gene expression and protein utilization (Paul et al., 2012b, 2013, 2017; Ferl et al., 2015). Recent studies have focused on the root apex, with its crucial role in root growth and morphogenesis, guided by the apex's sensitivity to environmental factors such as gravity, light, and nutrients. Root apexes and their importance In their book The Power of Movement in Plants, Charles and Francis Darwin describe the root apex (the 1.0–1.5‐mm region from the root tip) as the most sensitive zone of the root and refer to the apex as a diffuse brain‐like organ having the sensitivity and ability to direct the movements of adjoining parts (Darwin and Darwin, 1880). Later in the literature, this sensitive part of the root has been referred to with various nomenclature such as “postmitotic isodiametric zone” (Baluska et al., 1990; Ishikawa and Evans, 1992), “distal elongation zone” (Ishikawa and Evans, 1993), “transition zone” (Baluska et al., 2001), and “basal meristem zone” (De Smet et al., 2007). The cells in the actively growing root apex undergo four distinct phases of cellular activities, based on which the regions above the root cap can be divided into four different zones: the meristematic zone, the transition zone, the zone of cell elongation, and the growth‐terminating zone (Verbelen et al., 2006). The meristematic zone is a zone of active cell divisions, whereas the transition zone is composed of cells undergoing slow cell growth in length and width. Fast cell elongation in length and bulging of root hairs from the trichoblasts are seen in the elongation zone. In the growth‐terminating zone, cells slow down elongation as they reach their mature length and develop active growth of root hairs (Verbelen et al., 2006). The root apex in general and the transition zone in particular are shown to respond to internal and external stimuli and signal adaptive root activities (Baluska et al., 2010). Root tips play an important role in sensing external stimuli and signaling the growth and movement of plant roots in the soil. Various studies on plant response to gravity (Chen et al., 1998; Baldwin et al., 2013), light (Wan et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhang and Yu, 2014), and touch (Massa and Gilroy, 2003) suggest the importance of root tips in these functions. However, the role of distinct zones of the root tips has not been extensively characterized, and consequently there is a need to study the subzones of the root apex in greater detail. Technologies like microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) enable high‐throughput gene profiling of such zones. In the present study, we compared the gene expression differences in Zone 2 (consisting of the root elongation and root differentiation zone) with that of Zone 1 (consisting of root cap and root division zone) in order to assess the applicability of such dissections before applying the techniques to spaceflight and ground control samples. We also employed both microarray and RNA‐Seq technology to identify the differentially expressed genes between two zones of the root tip in order to compare the two techniques with respect to genes relevant to spaceflight. This study presents several distinct points. First, it provides a high‐fidelity, comprehensive comparison of root zone–specific gene expression patterns using two transcriptome approaches under sample constrained conditions. Second, it identifies novel genes that were differentially expressed between the two root zones; these heretofore unknown genes could lead to new insights in molecular and functional analysis of root tip responses to environmental and developmental stimuli. Third, it illustrates how genes with low expression levels can be missed by RNA‐Seq, which in the present case resulted in the failure of RNA‐Seq to identify numerous spaceflight‐relevant genes of interest. Finally, it outlines strategies for handling the molecular analyses of very small samples that require preservation in remote locations, which is relevant to research involving limited tissue samples, such as is typical for spaceflight and other expedition experiments.METHODS Plant material Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) seedlings were grown on sterile solid media plates composed of 2.2 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 0.5 g of MES hydrate, 5.0 g of sucrose, and 1.0 mL of Gamborg vitamins (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), and then adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1 M KOH. The media was solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma‐Aldrich). The plates were vertically oriented in growth chambers with continuous light (80–100 μmol s−2m−2) at a constant temperature of 19°C. This plant growth configuration has been used for both laboratory and spaceflight plant growth (Paul et al., 2013; Schultz et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). Eight‐day‐old seedlings were harvested from a single plate, placed in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) in 50‐mL centrifuge tubes, and stored in a freezer at −20°C.Sample preparation for transcriptomics Seedlings preserved in RNAlater were thawed to room temperature and transferred to an open Petri dish. The seedlings in the Petri dish and were viewed with an Olympus SZX12 dissecting microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the Petri plate served as a working surface to select primary roots and then dissect them into their appropriate zones. A thin‐ruled grid was adhered to the bottom of the plate to facilitate precise cuts between the zones (Fig. 1). Plants were kept submerged in RNAlater at all times. Three independent seedlings were used as three biological replicates for each of the transcriptome analyses. All seedlings were grown on the same plate. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Root dissection shown in eight‐day‐old Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype seedlings, grown on vertically placed Phytagel plates under continuous light. The root apex was sectioned into two zones: Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth‐terminating zone). The root tip shown is an eight‐day‐old, RNA later‐preserved seedling stained with toluidine blue observed under a dissecting microscope. Scale is in millimeters.The root tips were dissected into Zone 1 (0.5 mm from the tip, including the root cap and root division zones) and Zone 2 (1.5‐mm sections including the root elongation and root differentiation zone) (as shown in Fig. 1). Dissected RNAlater‐preserved root tips were carefully transferred into pre‐labeled microcentrifuge tubes and then flash‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from these frozen samples using the ARCTURUS PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Five nanograms of RNA from each sample was used for low‐input array and RNA sequencing. Genes that significantly changed in Zone 2 (Treatment 2) as compared to Zone 1 (Treatment 1) were measured using microarray and RNA‐Seq. The transcripts identified as significantly changed at fold change of 2 or greater from the two techniques were used for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the significantly changed genes (fold change) between Zone 2 and Zone 1 was conducted using agriGO (Du et al., 2010). Microarray analyses and RNA‐Seq were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression and Sequencing Core at the University of Florida. ICBR conducted the initial analyses of microarray and RNA‐Seq data for quality control, normalization, mapping reads to genome data, annotated transcripts, and profiling of gene expression.Affymetrix Arabidopsis genome arrays Sample preparation and hybridization Five nanograms of total RNA were amplified with the Ovation Pico WTA System V2 kit (NuGEN Technologies Inc., Redwood City, California, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fragmentation and biotinylation were performed with the Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Five micrograms of amplified and labeled cDNA was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto the Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis Genome ATH1 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, USA) for 16 h at 45°C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) with Washing Procedure FS450_0001. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Statistical analysis associated with microarray Primary data analysis was performed using the R/Limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015). Affymetrix CEL files were first analyzed using the FastQC package for quality control (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The arrays were then normalized using the RMA algorithm, and differential analysis was performed. Comparative analyses were conducted with the normalized signal intensity values between root tip Zone 1 and root tip Zone 2. The fold change was computed based on the normalized log‐transformed signal intensity data for each gene locus in the Zone 1 and Zone 2 groups. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using a log2 fold change (log2 FC), at the 1% significance level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Genes differentially expressed with fold change of 2 or greater at FDR <0.01 were used for further analysis.RNA‐Seq RNA‐Seq library preparation using SMART‐Seq V4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing combined with Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit Five nanograms of total RNA were used for cDNA library construction using ClonTech SMART‐Seq V4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (TaKaRa Bio USA, Mountain View, California, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, first‐strand cDNA was primed by the SMART‐SMARTer II A oligonucleotide (TaKaRa Bio USA) and then base pairs were combined with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switched templates and continued transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting in full‐length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence, which served as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 10 PCR cycles. Illumina sequencing libraries were then generated with 120 pg of cDNA using the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (FC‐131‐1024; Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 120 pg of cDNA was used as input for the Nextera tagmentation reaction (fragmentation and tagging), and then adapter sequences were added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and reverse transcription real‐time PCR (RT‐qPCR) (KAPA Library Quantification Kit, catalog no. KK4824; Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Finally, the libraries were pooled by equal molar concentration and sequenced by Illumina 2 × 150 NextSeq 500.NextSeq 500 sequencing In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and then quantitated using the Qubit Fluorometer and RT‐qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog no. KK4824). Individual samples were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This “working pool” was used as input in the NextSeq 500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, catalog no. 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3‐pM library concentration resulted in optimum clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ~200,000 clusters/mm2). Samples were sequenced on a single flow cell, using a 2 × 150 cycles (paired‐end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq 500 produced 750–800 million paired‐end reads with a Q30 ≥ 85%. For RNA‐Seq, approximately 40 million reads/sample provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis.Mapping reads to genome data, transcript annotation, and profiling of gene expression The paired‐end reads were mapped to the A. thaliana Columbia ecotype reference genome (TAIR10) using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2012). A multi‐step process of transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis was done using the Cufflinks tool (Trapnell et al., 2012). Reads that map to each transcript were counted and normalized based on fragment length and total reads. Normalized counts were expressed in terms of FPKM values (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments). FPKM is directly proportional to abundance of the transcript. The expression data were generated at FDR = 0.01.RESULTS Transcriptome data were obtained from the two root tip zones (Fig. 1) through both microarray and RNA‐Seq. A total of approximately 33,500 and 22,700 genes were detected as expressed in the root zones from RNA‐Seq and microarray, respectively (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession GSE115555). Differentially expressed genes in the two root zones Microarray detected a total of 6351 genes significantly altered with fold change of 2 or greater, whereas RNA‐Seq detected a total of 6403 genes that were differentially expressed between the two root zones. Among these two sets of genes, 4180 genes were commonly identified by both techniques (Fig. 2A). Out of the 6403 genes detected by RNA‐Seq, 2223 genes were exclusive to RNA‐Seq at a fold change of 2 or greater. However, out of these 2223 genes, 771 were truly unique to RNA‐Seq and the remaining 1452 genes were detected by microarray but did not pass the cutoff value of fold change 2 or greater (log2 FC ≥1 or ≤1). Expression levels of genes estimated by RNA‐Seq were higher than those estimated by microarray. Therefore, a greater number of genes passed the fold change cut‐off criteria in RNA‐Seq than in the microarray. With increased fold change requirements, RNA‐Seq detected a higher number of genes compared to the microarray (Fig. 2B, C). At fold change levels of 4 and 8, RNA‐Seq identified 364 and 63 unique genes compared to 41 and six genes, respectively, identified by the microarray (inner circles in the Venn diagram; Fig. 2). Overall, RNA‐Seq was more efficient in detecting a greater number of significantly changed genes compared to the microarray. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Comparison of differentially expressed genes in root Zone 2 vs. Zone 1 by RNA‐Seq and microarray. The Venn diagram shows the overlap between differentially expressed genes from RNA‐Seq and microarray data at log2 FC ≥1 or ≤1 (A), log2 FC ≥2 or ≤2 (B), and log2 FC ≥4 or ≤4 (C). Numbers indicated in the Venn circles are the differentially expressed genes exclusive to each technique at that fold level, whereas the numbers in the inner circles indicate the subset of genes truly unique to RNA‐Seq or microarray and not found in the other technique. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified using a log2 FC at FDR < 0.01.Differentially expressed genes in the two root zones were functionally distinct Distribution of transcripts into the most prominent GO categories is summarized in Table 1. Upregulated functional groups listed in Table 1 are the ones enriched in Zone 2, which include lipid localization and transport, root morphogenesis, root epidermal cell differentiation, cell maturation, polypropenoid biosynthetic process, root hair cell differentiation, trichoblast maturation, and secondary metabolic process. The downregulated genes in Zone 2 are those genes enriched in root Zone 1 (tip).

Open in a new tab cds = coding DNA sequence.Root Zone 2 was enriched with genes involved in secondary growth metabolic processes such as response to stimulus, cell elongation, differentiation and root hair development, and maturation (Table 1). Genes in these categories included arabinogalactan proteins (AT4G40090, AT5G44130), basic helix‐loop‐helix (bHLH) protein (AT5G58010), and the leucine‐rich repeats (LRX)/extensin family proteins (AT1G12040, AT4G02270). Another set of genes highly enriched in Zone 2 are the lipid metabolism proteins: the protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein (LTP) family proteins (AT1G48750, AT5G05960, AT3G18280). Also induced were peroxidases that are root hair specific (AT5G67400, AT1G30870) and the cell signaling gene (AT1G02900). Root Zone 1 was enriched with genes involved in primary growth metabolisms like cellular components, cell cycle, and DNA metabolism. Genes enriched in root tip Zone 1 included: cell wall biogenesis and organization genes (AT5G13870, AT1G57590); regulation of gene expression (AT3G52910, AT2G45050); ATP/microtubule binding (AT2G22610, AT5G48940); cell division/cell cycle (AT3G51280, AT2G28790); and response to mechanical, light, and organism stimulus (AT2G23050 [gravitropism], AT2G45050 [light], AT5G19520 [mechanical], AT1G18250 and AT2G28790 [pathogen]). Other genes enriched in Zone 1 included those with predicted function of ion binding and transport (AT5G19520, AT2G34020, AT2G25060), along with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein (AT5G60530).RNA‐Seq–identified unique/novel genes not identified by microarray RNA‐Seq detected 771 genes that were not detected by the microarray (Appendix S1). Three hundred thirty‐nine genes were enriched in root tip Zone 2 (upregulated in Zone 2), and 432 genes were enriched in root tip Zone 1 (downregulated in Zone 2) (Appendix S1). GO analysis of these genes clustered the genes into the following groups: structural constituent of ribosome, structural molecular activity, and translation elongation factor activity. The top 20 genes with highest fold change are listed in Table 3. These included extensin family protein (AT3G09925), phosphate transporter 1 (AT5G43350), ovate family protein 17 (AT2G30395), pectin lyase‐like superfamily protein (AT4G23500), cytokinin response factor 4 (AT4G27950), protein kinase family protein (AT5G07140), transducin family protein (AT4G33270), and defensin‐like protein (AT4G22235).

Out of these 107 transcripts, 19 were found to be significantly changed between the zones at FDR < 0.01 (Appendix S2).Additional information from RNA‐Seq on differentially expressed genes In addition to the differential gene expression data, RNA‐Seq provided information on isoforms, coding DNA sequences, and transcription start sites. Figure 3 provides examples of isoform information from four different genes in Zone 2 that were significantly altered between the two root zones to study their isoform information—two upregulated genes: AT5G05960 (protease inhibitor/seed storage/lipid transfer protein [LTP] family protein) and AT4G02270 (pollen Ole e 1 allergen and extensin family protein) and two downregulated genes: AT2G23050 (NPY4 [NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS 4]) and protein binding/signal transducer (NPY4) and AT1G18250 (Arabidopsis thaumatin‐like protein [ATLP‐1]). The differential expression of these four genes in the two root zones from microarray and RNA‐Seq are shown in Fig. 3A. Log2 FC values for these genes in RNA‐Seq and microarray were comparable, and RNA‐Seq estimated a higher level of fold change for all four genes (Fig. 3A). Expression levels of these genes (Fig. 3B) and isoforms (Fig. 3C) in root Zone 1 and 2 were plotted using FPKM values measured by RNA‐Seq. Although all of these genes were significantly changed between Zone 1 and Zone 2 (Fig. 3B), the different FPKM values measured can be attributed to changes in alternative isoforms (Fig. 3C). For instance, the FPKM values of two isoforms of genes AT5G05960 and AT2G23050 are not significantly changed individually (Fig. 3C), but when the expression values are added up there is a significant change in gene expression (Fig. 3B). On the contrary, in genes AT4G02270 and AT1G18250, one isoform in each gene (TCONS_00025944 and TCONS_00005036, respectively) was significantly altered in expression, leading to a change in the total FPKM values (Fig. 3C).

Previous studies on root gene expression have been predominantly conducted with larger sections of the root or a pooled sample of root tips (Gupta et al., 2013; Nestler et al., 2014; Niu et al., 2014; Secco et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015). Recent advances in RNA isolation have enabled full transcriptomic analysis from tiny plant samples. In this study, we extracted RNA from single root tips of young A. thaliana seedlings for microarray and RNA‐Seq analysis. The ability to conduct gene expression analyses in such small tissue samples will enable identification of novel and important genes whose quantification is otherwise diluted in larger tissue/organ/pooled samples. In the comparison of gene expression data obtained by microarray and RNA‐Seq approaches, RNA‐Seq was more powerful in identifying differentially expressed genes in the root zone samples (Fig. 2). Although this general conclusion regarding RNA‐Seq in comparison to microarrays is widely accepted, the direct comparison of RNA‐Seq to microarray data obtained from the same spaceflight‐relevant tissue sets provides a unique perspective and a direct data set with which to baseline RNA‐Seq and microarray data within the existing spaceflight database within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s GeneLab (Arabidopsis Data Repository; NASA GeneLab, 2018). However, the benefits of RNA‐Seq demonstrated here are consistent with other, broad studies that compare the two methods. Most of those benefits come from the dynamic range of RNA‐Seq. The estimated gene expression levels were generally higher in RNA‐Seq compared to the microarray (Table 2). Lower fold changes in the microarray could be attributed to saturation of fluorescence signals. In addition, microarrays depend on probe design based on previously annotated gene/expressed sequence tag sequence information, whereas RNA‐Seq provides unbiased sequence counts that can provide information on unannotated regions in addition to known, annotated genes. In this study, RNA‐Seq identified many differentially expressed genes that were not detected by microarray (Table 3, Appendix S1) and allowed for the identification of the specific isoforms of genes that contributed to the change in level of gene‐expressed information (Fig. 3). We identified 107 putative transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that were not noted in the TAIR database (Appendix S2). Of these, 19 had significantly altered expressions in the two zones. These novel transcripts could be further characterized for their function in the roots. However, there are spaceflight‐relevant genes that were not detectable in these RNA‐Seq data. Comparison of the RNA‐Seq gene lists from Zone 1 and Zone 2 revealed that more than 50 of the highly differentially expressed spaceflight genes detected by microarray analyses were not detected by RNA‐Seq. These genes include genes that are annotated, revealed in other experiments, and many that have been confirmed to exist by RT‐qPCR. Thus, there remain genes that are spaceflight relevant that are best detected by means other than RNA‐Seq, particularly genes that have low expression levels or are rarely expressed among cell types. This phenomenon is likely to extend to other environmental responses that induce similar gene expression patterns. The list of plant studies that examine gene expression patterns of root zones, and even root cell lineages, is ever expanding, particularly in recent years as tools and approaches provide increasing fidelity in the ability to discriminate among cell types (Birnbaum et al., 2003; Brady et al., 2007; Bruex et al., 2012; Kyndt et al., 2012; Bailey‐Serres, 2013; Gotté et al., 2016; Royer et al., 2016; Libault et al., 2017; Wendrich et al., 2017). In addition, the expansion of available reference genomes for a variety of plants enables the molecular comparisons of cell type and tissue comparisons among species (Galbraith and Birnbaum, 2006; Huang and Schiefelbein, 2015; Karve and Iyer‐Pascuzzi, 2015). The current study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the root tip transcriptome, and also contributes a unique perspective for the distribution of expressed genes along the root tip in the context of the tools and approaches used to make those assessments. The root zones were microdissected from RNAlater‐preserved roots. This approach separated the root tip organ into zones comprising several cell types, cells that make an overall contribution to the transcriptional environment in that zone. In addition, microdissection of RNAlater‐preserved tissue minimizes environmentally induced patterns of gene expression that could be associated with either the dissection of live tissue, or protoplast isolation and cell sorting. The study presented here contributes to the growing wealth of data that expand our understanding of how the transcriptome guides Arabidopsis root function and differentiation. The experimental design used in this study provided a new look at gene expression patterns from distinct root tip zones, and also served to compare and contrast approaches to characterizing transcriptomes from preserved material of limited quantity. The transcriptomic techniques of the ATH1 microarray and RNA deep sequencing were comparable in detecting the genes enriched in the two root zones and in revealing distinct patterns of gene expression unique to each zone. An extensive discussion of the genes differentially expressed in the root zones is presented in Appendix S3. RNA‐Seq was more efficient in identifying unique and novel transcripts that were not detected by microarray; however, at the read depths used here, which are generally accepted, RNA‐Seq failed to detect some spaceflight‐relevant genes of interest, suggesting that some studies may require extended read depths or require hybridization or RT‐qPCR methods to monitor low‐expressing genes.DATA ACCESSIBILITY All sequence data are archived in the  Gene Expression Ominibus (GEO accession no.
