Copyright notice ID: 5201052 PMID: 28034853 Abstract The draft genome sequences of 20 biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) opportunistic pathogens isolated from the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) were presented. These genomic sequences will help in understanding the influence of microgravity on the pathogenicity and virulence of these strains when compared with Earth strains.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT In an on-going Microbial Observatory experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), multiple biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) bacterial isolates were isolated, identified, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The genomic data enables the determination of the microgravity influence on pathogenicity and virulence in these microorganisms by comparison to type strains of the corresponding species. Acinetobacter pittii is a nonmotile coccobacilli isolated for the first time from cerebrospinal fluid (1). Multiple strains of A. pitti were isolated from the cupola area. The IIF1SW-P1 was resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin, and rifampin. Two multidrug-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates were found in the waste and hygiene compartment (WHC) location. Species of Enterobacter cloacae complex (Ecc) are commonly found in the environment, but are of high clinical significance (2). Pantoea conspicua was originally isolated from human blood (3). This was the second most prevalent species, and was only found in one location during two different flight samplings. P. conspicua isolates were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin, penicillin, and rifampin. Staphylococcus isolates were the most prevalent from ISS surfaces. Staphylococcus aureus was the most abundant in all ISS locations. Although this species is a common human commensal (4), it causes various types of minor skin infections, bacteremia, or scalded skin syndrome, especially in immunocompromised individuals (5). In this study, some of the isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin (IF4SW-P1, IF7SW-P3) and most of the isolates were resistant to penicillin. A few isolates acquired rifampin resistance during the study (RA isolates). Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis belong to coagulase-negative staphylococci (6, 7). S. hominis IIF4SC-B9 was resistant to penicillin and erythromycin, but S. haemolyticus IIF2SW-P5 was susceptible to these antibiotics. All three species are reported to be methicillin resistant by acquiring the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) (8), but the methicillin-resistant phenotype was not observed. In this study, the draft genomes sequences of 20 strains from the ISS were obtained. WGS sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with a paired-end module. The A5 assembly pipeline version 20150522 was used to generate draft assemblies applying the default parameter settings (9) and annotated with the help of the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) (10). Table 1 summarizes assembly statistics (number of contigs, total genome size, N50 size, median coverage, G+C percentage, error corrected reads used for assembly, and number of coding sequences). The raw reads were in the range of 24 to 82 Mbp per genome. The G+C content was in the range of 31.5 to 38.7% for Staphylococcus species and A. pittii; for other strains the G+C contents were 55.2 to 55.8%. The subsystem features created using RAST for all 20 strains are depicted in Table 1. TABLE 1 . Statistics summary for the 20 draft ISS BSL-2 bacterial genome sequences Strain  accession no.

Copyright notice ID: 5391430 PMID: 28408692 ABSTRACT The whole-genome sequences of eight fungal strains that were selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station are presented here. These baseline sequences will help to understand the observed production of novel bioactive compounds.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT In a screening project of natural products, fungal strains isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP) accident (1) have been investigated. The radiation-tolerant microorganisms selected for exposure to microgravity at the International Space Station were known to produce valuable natural products; their genomic sequences coded for secondary metabolism pathways; or they displayed positive radiotropism. Aspergillus niger, an industrially important filamentous fungus, contains a sequence resembling the fumonisin gene cluster, which suggests that the fungus has the genetic potential to produce carcinogenic fumonisins (2). A. niger also produces an abundance of naphtho-gamma-pyrone secondary metabolites, which have been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal (3), antitumor (4), and cytotoxic (3, 4) activity. Aspergillus terreus is used to produce organic acids, such as itaconic acid (5), or enzymes, such as xylanases (6, 7). One of the most important secondary metabolites made by A. terreus is the cholesterol-lowering molecule lovastatin. Discovery of this potent compound revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (8, 9). Aureobasidium pullulans is an important producer of pullulan, a homopolysaccharide of glucose that is widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and electronics industries (10, 11). The whole-genome sequence of A. pullulans revealed significant biotechnological potential but also the presence of virulence factors that cannot be overlooked (12). Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungus used to produce biodegradable, nonpoisonous, and cost-efficient bioinsecticides (13). Genomic analysis of B. bassiana exhibits its capacity to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites, such as oosporein, bassianin, beauvericin, or oxalic acid (14). Beauvericin possesses antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, and antitumor activity (15). Cladosporium cladosporioides, a ubiquitous organism, produces cladosporin and isocladosporin—secondary metabolites known to have antifungal activities. Its genome has not been sequenced yet (16, 17). Cladosporium sphaerospermum is a plant endophyte but also an allergen to immunocompromised populations. It has the capacity to produce a variety of allergens, such as enolase, mannitol, dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (18). Fusarium solani is a plant pathogen that produces multiple phytotoxins, such as marticin, isomarticin, anhydrofusarubin, and javanicin, that cause sudden death syndrome of soybean (19), for example. Trichoderma virens is a common rhizosphere fungus beneficial to plants and reported to induce a defense response of cotton to Rhizoctonia solani–incited seedling disease (20, 21). The whole-genome sequences of these eight fungal strains were obtained by shotgun sequencing performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform with a paired-end module. The NGS QC toolkit version 2.3 (22) was used to filter the data for high-quality vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for high quality: 80%; cutoff quality score: 20). High-quality vector-filtered reads were used for assembly with the MaSuRCA genome assembler (k-mer size = 70) (23). Data from the final assembly of the strains, including number of scaffolds, total size, N50 contig length, G+C content, and GenBank accession numbers, are given in Table 1. TABLE 1 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat.Results Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time.Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0280-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Closed habitat, Surface, Mycobiome, Succession",

    "methods": "Methods The ILMAH habitat The physical characteristics of the ILMAH, along with detailed sampling procedures and periodicity, were previously described [7]. In brief, the ILMAH is located in Grand Forks, ND (47.9222 N, 97.0734 W) and has dimensions of 12 m by 10 m by 2.5 m. It contains a sleeping compartment, kitchen, toilet, and laboratory area. The ILMAH has its own ventilation system that pressurizes the habitat, provides breathing air for the crew, and removes unwanted material from the air stream. The ILMAH uses a blower that takes ambient air for pressurization and breathing air provision. It provides a positive pressure at 1 PSID (pressure differential) above normal atmosphere inside the habitat. The ambient air is pressurized by an industrial fan and sent to a standard HEPA flat panel particulate filter (Bryant GAPBBCAR2025, Honeywell, Morris Plains, NJ). This filter is replaced before each mission lasting up to 30 days. Maintenance personnel changes the filter from the outside. Since the humidity inside the habitat is not removed, water vapor during the months when the analog missions takes place range from 35 to 55%. Three student crews inhabited the ILMAH for 30 days. During that period of time, there was no exchange between the interior and exterior environment except pumping the air filtered via ILMAH’s advanced controlling system [3]. In addition, students did not leave the ILMAH at any time for 30 days, and nothing came in or out, including food, people, water, or any supplies, except filtered air. Surface samples were collected consecutively during four sampling events (day 0 [T0], day 13 [T13], day 20 [T20], and day 30 [T30]) from eight designated sampling locations. Prior to inhabitation, the ILMAH surfaces were cleaned with 10% bleach and during the experiment period, it was cleaned weekly with antibacterial wipes. Sampling materials and procedure Samples were collected using biological sampling kits (BiSKits, Quicksilver Analytics Inc., Abingdon, MD) previously documented as an efficient sampling device for surfaces [51]. All the BiSKits were prepared following the procedure described elsewhere [7, 51]. Briefly, the sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) provided by the distributor was discarded from the bottle and replaced with 15 mL of sterile UltraPure DNA free PBS (MoBio Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Each BiSKit was rinsed once with PBS that was later collected into a sterile 15-mL falcon tube and kept at 4 °C as a background measure for biological materials associated with macrofoam (sampling device control). This precautionary step was required to overcome, if encountered, microbial contamination associated with sampling devices and other processing reagents. BiSKits prepared as described above were then packed into sterile zip lock bags and shipped at 4 °C to the University of North Dakota where they were kept at 4 °C till the experiment was carried out (within 2 to 3 days). The ILMAH architecture was previously described [7] (see Additional file 1: Figure SF1, Fig. 1). Surface samples were collected from eight locations at four consecutive samplings: day 0 (prior to inhabitation), day 13, day 20, and day 30 during the inhabitation and right before ending the experiment. Originally, sampling activities were scheduled at regular intervals days 0, 10, 20, and 30 of human occupation; however, day 10 sampling scheduled on Thursday was delayed to day 13 (Sunday) to avoid risk related to shipping the samples over the weekend. The work schedule of the ILMAH crew members was regulated and is detailed in Additional file 2. Each location (surface area 1 m2) was sampled with one BiSKit in three directions following the same steps, horizontally from the left to the right, vertically from the bottom to the top, and diagonally from the right bottom corner to the left upper corner. After sampling, the sampled BiSKit device was extracted with sterile PBS and sampling fluids were collected in sterile 50-mL falcon tubes. Each BiSKit was washed and extracted twice with the sterile PBS giving approximately 45 mL of unconcentrated sample. Likewise, the BiSKit left open in the sampling area for the time necessary for sampling one location was treated as a field control; the unopened BiSKit was treated as a sampling device (BiSKit) control. Collected samples along with the controls were stored at 4 °C and sent overnight to JPL via cold shipping for further analysis. Sample processing for the microbiological analyses was started within 24 h from the sample collection. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Picture of the closed habitat from outside Sample processing The extruded liquid samples from the BiSKit sampler (~45 mL per sample) were concentrated using an InnovaPrep Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep LLC, Drexel, MO) to a final volume of ~4 mL. Appropriate aliquots of concentrated samples were further used for cultivation (200 μL) and molecular analyses (3 mL). Cultivable fungal burden and diversity For cultivation assay, samples were serially diluted by 10 and 100 times. One hundred microliters of each dilution was pour plated in duplicates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and grown at room temperature (~25 °C). Colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation, and cultivable fungal population was calculated per square meter of the sampling area. Simultaneously, up to 5 colonies exhibiting different morphologies were picked and stored as stab cultures in one-tenth semi-solid PDA medium. Cultivable isolates were identified using primers ITS 1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) and Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) that target small and large subunit rRNA gene-coding regions of the small and large ribosomal subunit, including the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 [52, 53]. DNA was extracted using freezing (−80 °C) and thawing (+80 °C) cycle of fungal suspension in PBS for 15 min. This process was repeated 3 times. In some cases when DNA was not extracted by the freezing-thawing method, a PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified products were visualized by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were then enzymatically purified by using 40 IU of Exonuclease I (E. coli 20,000 IU/mL New England BioLabs, Inc. Ipswich, MA) and 8 IU of Antarctic Phosphatase (5,000 IU/mL, New England BioLabs, Inc.) per 20 μL amplification product. Heat reactions were carried out in a thermocycler as follows: 37 °C for 30 min, 80 °C for 15 min. Traditional Sanger sequencing was performed at Macrogen (Rockville, MD). The sequences were merged using DNAStar (Madison, WI), identified using UNITE fungal database [54], and aligned using ClustalW. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.06-mac applying neighbor-joining method [55]. Sequences from one representative of each strain and corresponding type strain were used to create the phylogenetic tree. DNA extraction The concentrated environmental samples (3 mL) were split into two equal parts. One half of the sample (1.5 mL) was treated with 12.5 μL of 2 mM PMA dye (Biotum, Inc., Hayward, CA), and the other half was left untreated. The final concentration of PMA in each treated sample was 25 μM. After PMA addition, both treated and untreated samples were kept in the dark for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently exposed to light in the PHaST Blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L, Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min. PMA-treated samples represent viable microorganisms whereas the non-PMA-treated samples represent the total number of viable and dead microorganisms [56]. After photo activation, each sample was split into two aliquots of 0.75 mL each. One aliquot of each sample was subjected to bead beating for 60 s at 5 m/s on the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). The solution after bead beating was combined with not bead-beated aliquots (1.5 mL), and then used for DNA extraction using the Maxwell-16 MDx automated system following manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Purified DNA was eluted into a final volume of 50 μL of Ultra Pure molecular water and divided into 4 aliquots that were stored at −80 °C. Molecular fungal community analysis using Illumina sequencing To determine fungal populations, a two-step amplification process was applied prior to MiSeq Illumina sequencing at Research and Testing Laboratory (RTL, Lubbock, TX). The forward primer was constructed with the Illumina i5 sequencing primer (5′-TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG-3′) and the ITS1F primer (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) [57]. The reverse primer was constructed with the Illumina i7 sequencing primer (5′-GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G-3′) and the ITS2aR primer (5′-GCT GCG TTC TTC ATC GAT GC-3′) [58]. Amplifications were performed in 25 μL reactions with Qiagen HotStar Taq master mix (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), 1 μL of each 5 μM primer, and 1 μL of template. Reactions were performed on ABI Veriti thermocyclers (Applied Biosytems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following thermal profile: 95 °C for 5 min, then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min and 4 °C hold. Products from the first stage amplification were added to a second PCR based on qualitatively determined concentrations. Primers for the second PCR were designed based on the Illumina Nextera PCR primers as follows: Forward –AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC AC [i5index] TCG TCG GCA GCG TC and Reverse – CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT [i7index] GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG. The second stage amplification was run the same as the first stage except for 10 cycles. Amplification products were visualized with eGels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Products were then pooled equimolar, and each pool was size selected in two rounds using Agencourt AMPure XP (BeckmanCoulter, Indianapolis, IN) in a 0.7 ratio for both rounds. Size-selected pools were then quantified using the Quibit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) 2 × 300 flow cell at 10 pM. Bioinformatic and statistical analysis of fungal cultivable counts and Illumina sequences To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time and location), the following univariate statistical analyses were carried out (https://www.r-project.org/). The normal distribution of the populations was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and as most were not normally distributed (p value <0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn’s test (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dunn.test/index.html) to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [59]. A total of 8,426,774 raw paired reads were processed with mothur v.1.36.1 [60]. The 250 bp paired reads were merged by aligning the reads and correcting discordant base calls by requiring one of the base calls to have a Phred quality score at least 6 points higher than the other. Sequences shorter than 200 bp, having more than 8 homopolymers or containing ambiguous base pairs were excluded from the dataset. Subsequently, reads were pre-clustered [61] by combining low-abundant sequences that differed by 3 or less bases of a more abundant sequence. Chimeric sequences in each sample were identified by UCHIME [62] and also excluded from the dataset. Reads were classified using the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier II [63] implementation of mothur and UNITE fungal rDNA database [54]. Non-fungal sequences were subsequently removed. ITSx was used to exclude non-ITS sequences from the dataset prior to clustering unaligned sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a distance of 0.03 [64] using mother v.1.36.1. The nearest neighbor (single-linkage) algorithm was used for this. OTUs were classified by using the consensus taxonomy of all sequences assigned [60]. An in-house R-script employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac was used to compare the fungal Illumina data (Additional file 3) [65, 66]. Each dataset consisting of the OTU abundances per sample was rarefied 1000 times to the lowest number of reads, and an average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated. This distance was then utilized to calculate nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), PERMANOVA (Adonis test), and multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP). In addition, the OTU abundances per sample of each dataset were sum normalized and used to employ either an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Spearman rank correlation on the statistically significant changing parameters and to generate a heat map (p value 0.05). The change of diversity was measured via the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. OTUs that were unclassified at phylum level were removed. Heat maps were presented at family level.",
    "results": "Results Cultivable fungal burden and diversity The culture-based fungal abundance of the ILMAH was estimated for each sampling location with colony-forming unit (CFU) values ranging from below detection limit (BDL) to 104 CFU/m2 (Additional file 4: Table ST1a). The highest abundance of the cultivable fungi was observed during the first sampling (T0) followed by ~1 log decrease in CFU during consecutive sampling events (T13, T20, T30) for each living compartment. High fungal population was noticed in samples collected at T0 (Fig. 2A). When statistically treated, the change in fungal abundance within different time points was significant (T0–T20 p = 0.008 and T0–T30 p = 0.0125) (Additional file 5: Table ST2a). The cultivable fungal population for the lab area was higher than observed in other compartments (Fig. 2B, Additional file 4: Table ST1b). A statistically significant difference was observed between the lab area and the bedroom (p = 0.0021) (Additional file 5: Table ST2b). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Statistical analysis of cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation period at all the locations based on colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time—A and location—B), we applied the following univariate statistics. The normal distribution of the populations were tested using Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and as most of them were not normally distributed (p value <0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn’s test to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. A CFU counts before crew occupation T0—a were statistically different from CFU counts at T20 and T30—b, but no statistical difference was observed between T0 and T13 counts—ab. Additionally, no statistical differences were observed between any other time points. B CFU counts in the bedroom—a, differed significantly from the CFU counts in lab—b, but no statistical differences were observed between bedroom and kitchen or toilet—ab. No statistical differences were observed between any other locationsOne hundred seventeen cultivable isolates were collected and identified targeting the ITS region. Screening sequences against the UNITE fungal database enabled identification of 32 species (Fig. 3). Among the cultivable isolates, only five strains had similarity lower than 97% that did not allow identification to the species level. All of the identified species but one—Hydnopolyporus fimbriatus—belong to the Ascomycota division (Fig. 3). The most abundant cultivable species were Cladosporium cladosporioides (16), Epicoccum nigrum (15), Aspergillus tubingensis (13), Aspergillus fumigatus (8), Alternaria tenuissima (7), and Pennicillium brevicompactum (7). P. brevicompactum was the only, out of the most commonly identified species, that was not present at multiple time points but only at T13 sampling (Fig. 3). Abundance of C. cladosporioides colonies increased during the ILMAH occupation whereas the abundance of E. nigrum, A. tubingensis, and A. tenuissima decreased. Another commonly isolated species, A. fumigatus, was not isolated during the last sampling event. Neither field nor sampling device controls showed cultivable isolates. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation period at all the locations based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbor-joining method (bootstrap 1000). In total, 117 isolates were collected 113 of which were successfully sequenced (4 strains either did not show growth or did not respond to the sequencing methods attempted). The numbering of the isolates is explained as follows: F = fungi, first number (0–4) will be the sample collection day (0 = T0, 2 = T13, 3 = T20, 4 = T30), second number (1–8) will be sampling location, and the third number (1–5) is the replicate number of the isolate. For example, F23-02 will be a fungal strain, isolated from T20, at location number 3 and a second isolate. Frequency of isolates is given as a frequency bar after the name of fungus. Colors of the bars correspond to the collection time (single or multiple) Viable and total mycobiome (iTag Illumina-based analysis) The fungal richness of PMA-treated (viable) samples decreased when compared to untreated samples (dead and alive). In PMA-untreated samples, 98 families were detected, whereas OTUs belonging to 41 of these families were not viable. Moreover, both PMA-treated and PMA-untreated samples differed significantly in community relationships (NMDS analysis in Fig. 4, Adonis p value = 0.006 and MRPP, significance of delta = 0.002; A = 0.0419) and their Shannon diversity index indicated a significant reduction (paired T test p = 0.0000012) in viable fungal diversity. Observed differences in the PMA-treated (Fig. 4a, c) and PMA-untreated samples (Fig. 4b, d) indicate that untreated samples are overestimating the observed fungi. This observation was further confirmed when alpha diversity of cultivable, viable, and total mycobiome was plotted over time (Fig. 5). In this research communication, only viable mycobiome was considered and discussed in detail. Illumina-based reads of sampling device and field controls showed negligible signal from DNA contamination and hence not included in the following analysis. Fig. 4.

Plots a, c, and b, d represent the same data but differ in colors to underscore the focus on distribution over time and location, respectivelyFig. 5. Open in a new tab Linear representation of alpha diversity averages change over time for cultivable, viable and total mycobiome Viable fungal community structure The most abundant phylum that dominated the viable mycobiome of the ILMAH was Ascomycota (90% of all characterized OTUs) followed by Basidiomycota and unclassified fungi (~4 and ~5%, respectively). Incidence of the fungal OTUs at the family level for various time points and locations are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The dominant Pleosporaceae (75% of all OTUs) along with unclassified fungi (5%) and Davidiellaceae (4%) constituted 84% of all OTUs present in PMA-treated samples (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 6). A closer look into the genus level of Pleosporaceae family indicated the domination of Epicoccum (92.95% of all OTUs) and Alternaria (6.8%) sequences.

T20 surface samples show different fungal profile when compared to other time points. T30 samples show increase in fungal diversity when compared to other time pointDifferences in the fungal community between samples were analyzed by multivariate statistics using ordination analyses and Monte Carlo-based permutation tests. Viable fungal communities showed similar mycobiome profiles throughout the sampling period except from the samples collected at T20, which were distinct (Fig. 4; Adonis p value = 0.001 and MRPP, significance of delta = 0.001 and A = 0.1168, Additional file 6: Figure SF2 MRPP: chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.1626, significance of delta 0.001; Adonis: delta = 0.019). Interestingly, community profiles were similar between samples collected before crew occupation (T0) and at T13 and T30 (Additional file 7: Figure SF3; chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.01802, significance of delta: 0.219, Adonis 0.228, Additional file 8: Table ST3). Observed differences in multivariate statistics led to the investigation of mycobiome changes on a single-OTU level. First, an Anova test carried out on samples that did not cluster with the rest (Fig. 4) showed presence of representatives of Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Saccharomycetales, Tremellales, and Trichocomaceae families. Second, throughout the inhabitation, the level of Pleosporaceae showed significant fluctuation—from 96 to 47% and 70% at T0, T20, and T30, respectively (Fig. 7). Additionally, while Pleosporaceae presence decreased to 47%, a significant increase in the levels of Davidiellaceae (22%), Dothioraceae (11%), Saccharomycetales (8%), and Trichocomaceae (8%) was observed when compared to other time points (Fig. 6, Additional file 9: Table ST4). Interestingly, the presence of less abundant families observed before crew occupancy (T0) increased at (T30), i.e., Davidiellaceae (4.45%), Hypocreaceae (1.26%), Phaeosphaeriaceae (3.54%), Teratosphaeriaceae (5.17%), and Sporidiobolales (2.81%), as well as members of new fungal families were observed, i.e., Capnodiales (0.5%), Chaetomiaceae (3.81%), and Peniophoraceae (1.26%) (Table 1 and Fig. 6, Additional file 9: Table ST4).

The OTU counts presented in the boxplots are the most abundant. Each time point is represented in a different color: T0—green, T13—orange, T20—red, T30—purple Spearman rank correlation was applied to each OTU’s abundance pattern and sampling event to determine significant correlation of viable fungal families with various time points. The results presented as a heat map contain 13 OTUs that showed a significant correlation with a p value of 0.01 and 32 OTUs with a p value of 0.05. All OTUs but Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Tremellales_3, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were more abundant during the sampling before the crew inhabited the ILMAH (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Heat map of the taxa that showed a significant correlation (p value 0.01) with the factor time in the PMA-treated sample set. The color blue indicates a low abundance of the single OTU in the respective sample, and orange indicates a high abundance of the single OTU in the respective sample. Each column represents one sample collected throughout the study. The numbering pattern is explained as follows 30 means 30-day study. The first number (0–4) will be the sample collection day (0 = T0, 2 = T13, 3 = T20, 4 = T30), second number (1–8) will be sampling location, and P stands for PMA-treated samples. For example, 30.06P will be a sample collected during the 30-day study from T0 at location 6Further investigation of OTU abundances on the genus level revealed changes in OTU counts over the course of time. The numbers of OTUs identified as Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, and Cryptococcus fluctuated from high abundance at T0 to significantly lower counts at T20 and then counts increased again at T30. OTUs identified as Davidiella increased throughout the occupation time whereas OTU counts for Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, and Candida were increasing over time (peak at T20) with a drastic decrease at T30. Location wise before the ILMAH occupation, all compartments exhibited high abundance of Epiccocum OTUs that decreased over time and again increased at T30. Alternaria OTUs were less abundant than the ones identified as Epiccocum genus. Nevertheless, they showed the same fluctuation pattern in all compartments but bedroom. While accumulation of Davidiella OTU counts was observed in bedroom and lab, the OTU counts in the bathroom did not differ between the T0 and T30. At the same time, accumulation of Davidiella OTUs was observed in the kitchen with the highest abundance during the T20 sampling event. To sum up, statistical analysis revealed differences in community structure between time points in particular between T20 and any other previous or following time point. Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Tremellales_3, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae families were shown to increase over the occupation time period. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Understanding microbial characteristic of a controlled habitat, like the ILMAH, may facilitate discerning the microbial population dynamics as well as the development of appropriate countermeasures. Knowledge about the viable mycobiome will not only allow the development of required maintenance and cleaning procedures in the closed habitat but also prevent it from deteriorating and being a potential health hazard for its inhabitants [67]. Multiple studies have shown that use of propidium monoazide (PMA), a dye that can penetrate the compromised cell walls, enables more accurate analysis of the viable microbiome [68, 69]. It was also shown that PMA treatment might be successfully applied to determine dead and viable counts for various fungal species [70, 71]. As in this study, other report proved that DNA from dead cells, when not removed from samples, before molecular analyses, might overshadow the actual diversity since presence of less abundant microbial species were masked [32]. PMA-treated and PMA-untreated samples varied significantly in the ILMAH fungal community structures (p value = 0.006), and it had been reported before that low abundant species were detected in PMA-treated samples for bacteria, fungi, and viruses [66]. This approach validated the importance of PMA treatment to accurately determine the viable mycobiome of environmental samples. As a result, this study discussed only viable fungal communities to determine succession patterns and community structure over the course of time. Various studies showed the positive correlation between changes in the indoor bacteriome and human presence [7, 28, 30, 66, 72] whereas such observation was not confirmed for the mycobiome [29, 30, 73]. Major sources of indoor microbiome were reported to be associated with human skin commensals transmitted via shoes, clothes, coughing, and talking [74, 75]. It was also shown that the indoor mycobiome was mostly influenced by airborne fungi rather than human presence and their shedding, despite the fact that fungi were associated with human skin, lungs, urogenital tract, oral nasal cavities, and the gut [30, 76–79]. In addition, few studies demonstrated that key determinants for mycobiome indoors might be the age of the built-in environments and the relative humidity, which can enhance fungal growth [80]. A recent 6-month survey on Japanese astronauts on the ISS revealed that the most abundant (dead or alive) fungal genus was Malassezia [10] whereas in this study, the most frequent viable fungal genera of closed habitat were Epiccocum, Alternaria, and Pleosporales, which are environmental organisms rather than human commensals. The presence of fungi inside the closed habitat, houses, or any types of man-made buildings was correlated with the amount of the water (relative humidity; RH) present in the environment [80]. The environmental relative moldiness index (ERMI) increases with elevated amounts of water [81]. The most abundant genera in common households were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Epicoccum whereas Aspergillus and Penicillium were predominant in water-damaged building [81]. Similarly, in this study (measured RH 32 to 55%), the most abundant fungal genera were Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, and Cryptococcus, which could be compared with the previous observations for common households. Nevertheless, genera present in houses and closed habitats could have an impact on human health. These molds were associated with allergies and asthma [67, 82]. Elevated level of fungal allergenic molecules, such as enzymes, toxins, cell-wall components, and cross-reactive proteins could induce type I hypersensitivity [67]. Additionally, because of their ability to colonize the human body and produce toxins, volatile organic compounds, and proteases, the common molds (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epicoccum) could damage airways of immunocompromised occupants, which make them more dangerous than any other allergenic source [82–85]. In this study, accumulation of Alternaria and Epicoccum genera over time was observed, which, in combination with reported decreased immunity in occupants of confined spaces, e.g., astronauts [50, 86] could lead to developing allergy and asthma symptoms. Throughout this study, the abundance of dominant Pleosporaceae family members decreased (94% at T0 to 71% at T30), while other fungal families were observed to increase, possibly as a result of human presence. However, positive correlation between increased fungal diversity and human presence requires studying the mycobiome of the occupants. It might be possible that the implemented cleaning procedures including weekly dusting, sweeping, wet mopping the floor, and antibacterial wipes resulted in suppressed growth of Pleosporaceae members over the time. The community structure observed at T20 was distinct from other time points. Detailed logging data collected during 30-day mission did not show any abnormal accidents or cleaning activities preceding T20 sampling. The recorded data indicated that cleaning was conducted between the sampling events (~4–5 days prior to sampling). However, the inhabiting crew might have inadvertently cleaned just prior to T20 sampling and that might have removed both total and viable fungal populations (Table 1). The significant increase of Davidiellaceae (22%), Dothioraceae (11%), Saccharomycetales (8%), and Trichocomaceae (8%) sequences at T20 might be due to the fact that under-represented members became available for PCR reaction among the competing dominant fungal DNA. Both Cladosporium sp. members of Davidiellaceae family and Aurobasidium sp. of Dothioraceae family have the capacity to survive extreme environments like the ice of the Antarctica [87] or radioactive explosion site of Chernobyl Power Plant accident [88]. Additionally, Cladosporium sp. and Aureobasidium pullulans were isolated from hypersaline waters with NaCl concentration reaching 25% indicating high osmotolerance [89, 90]. Penicillium sp. of Trichocomaceae family isolated from high-altitude soil in Indian Himalaya has been shown to tolerate a wide range of pH from 2 to 14 and a salt concentration between 10 and 20% [91]. Most of the Apergillus sp. of Trichocomaceae family is soil fungi or saprophytes [92], but there has been a recent report of isolation of A. fumigatus from ISS [32]. In-depth analysis of isolate ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 revealed increased UV resistance (in preparation) and virulence in neutrophil-deficient larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis [93]. All in all, the capacity to survive in such extreme environments might help the observed in the study Davidiellaceae, Dothioraceae, and Trichocomaceae species to adjust and survive hostile conditions of the ILMAH.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Accumulation of viable mycobiome during the experiment duration and differences in fungal community profiles were observed. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time. Unlike results of molecular analyses, cultivable fungi counts decreased over time. Epicoccum nigrum was the most dominant cultivable isolate; however, most of the fungal species detected via molecular approach were not cultured. During human presence, the overall fungal diversity has changed, that in the long run, may lead to a conclusion that proper maintenance protocols of a closed habitat may be required to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.",

Copyright notice ID: 5504618 PMID: 28693587 Abstract Background An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat.Results Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time.Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0280-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Closed habitat, Surface, Mycobiome, SuccessionBackground Planning future space explorations, involving potential human missions to Mars, would require constructing a safe closed habitat [1, 2]. An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH) is a unique, simulated closed environment (isolated by HEPA filtration) that can be utilized to overcome challenges associated with both technical and scientific issues [3]. Because the ILMAH mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and is treated as a prototype habitat for future space explorations, microbiological characteristics of such a closed environment is of high interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The environmentally controlled ILMAH is an easily accessible system that enables samples to be collected and analyzed at multiple times at relatively low cost. Understanding the microbiome of a closed system and its association with human inhabitation will help to assess the correlation between human health and microbiome of the habitat as well as the influence of microorganism on the habitat deterioration [4–6]. The highly specialized structure of the simulated ILMAH keeps its inhabitants in isolation from the outside environment. Except for the exchange of the air between outdoor and indoor environments via an advanced environmental control system, the ILMAH mimics the ISS and other future habitats of human explorers on the other planets [3]. This unique feature of the ILMAH allows observing the changes in the microbiome during human occupation. The bacteriome of the ILMAH was recently reported [7], as in the case of most of the studies reporting on bacterial microbiomes [8]. The molecular fungal diversity of Japanese Experimental Module—Kibo, on the ISS, revealed abundance of fungi associated with astronauts, but succession of viable fungal population in their habitat was not addressed [9]. The skin fungal microbiota of 10 Japanese astronauts showed temporal changes before, during, and after their stay on the ISS. The molecular fungal diversity associated with various body parts was reduced during the spaceflight when compared to pre-flight data. However, the ratio of Malassezia genetic signatures to all fungal gene copies (including dead fungal cells) increased during their stay at the ISS—but the viability of these fungi was not confirmed [10]. This is the first report that thoroughly characterizes the mycobiome of a simulated habitat meant for the future human habitats on other planets. Utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques enables more in-depth analysis of indoor microbiomes [11]. Many studies focus on the bacterial microbiome of intensive care units [8, 12–14], pharmaceutical clean rooms [15–17], or tissue banks [18] since their microbial composition has an impact on human health and life. Nosocomial infections acquired in hospitals and other health care facilities remain the sixth leading cause of death in the hospitals in USA [19, 20]. Nosocomial infections are mostly caused by various fungal species that belong to the Candida genus and filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus [21–23]. Therefore, it remains important to screen future closed habitats for the presence of opportunistic pathogens that can affect health of immunocompromised astronauts. So far, majority of the indoor microbiome studies have focused on the bacterial microbiome without analyzing the mycobiome. In addition, those few studies that characterized fungi of indoor environments focused on culture-based populations [24–27]. In those cases, where new molecular techniques were implemented [28–31] viable fungi were not differentiated from the total population (viable and dead) [32]. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing coupled with the propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment used in this study can determine the viable mycobiome. Fungi are extremophiles that can survive harsh conditions such as low nutrient [33], desiccation [34], high/low temperatures [35, 36], acidic/alkaline [37, 38], radiation [39, 40], and other environments [41, 42]. Fungal species not only have been isolated from all known environments on Earth, including barren lands like deserts, caves, or nuclear accident sites, but also are known to be difficult to eradicate from other types of environments including indoor and closed spaces [8, 36, 42, 43]. Characterizing and understanding possible changes to, and succession of, fungal species in the ILMAH is of high importance since some of the fungi are extremophiles that are not only potentially hazardous to inhabitants but also can deteriorate the habitat itself [25, 44, 45]. It was previously reported that people spending a significant amount of time indoors might suffer from so called “sick building syndrome” (SBS). SBS is characterized by health- and comfort-related syndromes (e.g., headache, tiredness) that ease after leaving a building. Fatigue and discomfort might be caused not only by physical characteristics of the closed system (humidity, temperature, lighting) but also by biological contamination from both bacteria and fungi [46, 47]. Fungal pathogens’ presence in indoor areas might pose health hazards for people exhibiting immunodeficiency [48]. Pathogenic fungi produce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (e.g., melanins, siderophores, or species-specific toxins), induce allergies, and cause diseases (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or cryptococcosis) [48, 49]. Prolonged stays in closed habitats (e.g., ILMAH, ISS, etc.) might be stressful for inhabitants and lead to a decrease in immune response; therefore, assessing the presence of any opportunistic pathogens is vital [50]. Previous reports on the mycobiome in NASA clean rooms and on the ISS documented NGS results from samples collected from various locations, but none of the studies focused on the analysis of the microbial succession of systematically collected samples [28, 32]. The bacterial and archaeal microbiome succession of the ILMAH using NGS has been carried out [7]. This is the first report characterizing the succession of fungi in a simulated closed system meant for human habitation on other planets utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques. In addition, attempts were made during this study to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the fungal population and diversity in a closed human habitat.Methods The ILMAH habitat The physical characteristics of the ILMAH, along with detailed sampling procedures and periodicity, were previously described [7]. In brief, the ILMAH is located in Grand Forks, ND (47.9222 N, 97.0734 W) and has dimensions of 12 m by 10 m by 2.5 m. It contains a sleeping compartment, kitchen, toilet, and laboratory area. The ILMAH has its own ventilation system that pressurizes the habitat, provides breathing air for the crew, and removes unwanted material from the air stream. The ILMAH uses a blower that takes ambient air for pressurization and breathing air provision. It provides a positive pressure at 1 PSID (pressure differential) above normal atmosphere inside the habitat. The ambient air is pressurized by an industrial fan and sent to a standard HEPA flat panel particulate filter (Bryant GAPBBCAR2025, Honeywell, Morris Plains, NJ). This filter is replaced before each mission lasting up to 30 days. Maintenance personnel changes the filter from the outside. Since the humidity inside the habitat is not removed, water vapor during the months when the analog missions takes place range from 35 to 55%. Three student crews inhabited the ILMAH for 30 days. During that period of time, there was no exchange between the interior and exterior environment except pumping the air filtered via ILMAH’s advanced controlling system [3]. In addition, students did not leave the ILMAH at any time for 30 days, and nothing came in or out, including food, people, water, or any supplies, except filtered air. Surface samples were collected consecutively during four sampling events (day 0 [T0], day 13 [T13], day 20 [T20], and day 30 [T30]) from eight designated sampling locations. Prior to inhabitation, the ILMAH surfaces were cleaned with 10% bleach and during the experiment period, it was cleaned weekly with antibacterial wipes.Sampling materials and procedure Samples were collected using biological sampling kits (BiSKits, Quicksilver Analytics Inc., Abingdon, MD) previously documented as an efficient sampling device for surfaces [51]. All the BiSKits were prepared following the procedure described elsewhere [7, 51]. Briefly, the sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) provided by the distributor was discarded from the bottle and replaced with 15 mL of sterile UltraPure DNA free PBS (MoBio Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Each BiSKit was rinsed once with PBS that was later collected into a sterile 15-mL falcon tube and kept at 4 °C as a background measure for biological materials associated with macrofoam (sampling device control). This precautionary step was required to overcome, if encountered, microbial contamination associated with sampling devices and other processing reagents. BiSKits prepared as described above were then packed into sterile zip lock bags and shipped at 4 °C to the University of North Dakota where they were kept at 4 °C till the experiment was carried out (within 2 to 3 days). The ILMAH architecture was previously described [7] (see Additional file 1: Figure SF1, Fig. 1). Surface samples were collected from eight locations at four consecutive samplings: day 0 (prior to inhabitation), day 13, day 20, and day 30 during the inhabitation and right before ending the experiment. Originally, sampling activities were scheduled at regular intervals days 0, 10, 20, and 30 of human occupation; however, day 10 sampling scheduled on Thursday was delayed to day 13 (Sunday) to avoid risk related to shipping the samples over the weekend. The work schedule of the ILMAH crew members was regulated and is detailed in Additional file 2. Each location (surface area 1 m2) was sampled with one BiSKit in three directions following the same steps, horizontally from the left to the right, vertically from the bottom to the top, and diagonally from the right bottom corner to the left upper corner. After sampling, the sampled BiSKit device was extracted with sterile PBS and sampling fluids were collected in sterile 50-mL falcon tubes. Each BiSKit was washed and extracted twice with the sterile PBS giving approximately 45 mL of unconcentrated sample. Likewise, the BiSKit left open in the sampling area for the time necessary for sampling one location was treated as a field control; the unopened BiSKit was treated as a sampling device (BiSKit) control. Collected samples along with the controls were stored at 4 °C and sent overnight to JPL via cold shipping for further analysis. Sample processing for the microbiological analyses was started within 24 h from the sample collection. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Picture of the closed habitat from outsideSample processing The extruded liquid samples from the BiSKit sampler (~45 mL per sample) were concentrated using an InnovaPrep Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep LLC, Drexel, MO) to a final volume of ~4 mL. Appropriate aliquots of concentrated samples were further used for cultivation (200 μL) and molecular analyses (3 mL). Cultivable fungal burden and diversity For cultivation assay, samples were serially diluted by 10 and 100 times. One hundred microliters of each dilution was pour plated in duplicates on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and grown at room temperature (~25 °C). Colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation, and cultivable fungal population was calculated per square meter of the sampling area. Simultaneously, up to 5 colonies exhibiting different morphologies were picked and stored as stab cultures in one-tenth semi-solid PDA medium. Cultivable isolates were identified using primers ITS 1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) and Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) that target small and large subunit rRNA gene-coding regions of the small and large ribosomal subunit, including the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 [52, 53]. DNA was extracted using freezing (−80 °C) and thawing (+80 °C) cycle of fungal suspension in PBS for 15 min. This process was repeated 3 times. In some cases when DNA was not extracted by the freezing-thawing method, a PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified products were visualized by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were then enzymatically purified by using 40 IU of Exonuclease I (E. coli 20,000 IU/mL New England BioLabs, Inc. Ipswich, MA) and 8 IU of Antarctic Phosphatase (5,000 IU/mL, New England BioLabs, Inc.) per 20 μL amplification product. Heat reactions were carried out in a thermocycler as follows: 37 °C for 30 min, 80 °C for 15 min. Traditional Sanger sequencing was performed at Macrogen (Rockville, MD). The sequences were merged using DNAStar (Madison, WI), identified using UNITE fungal database [54], and aligned using ClustalW. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6.06-mac applying neighbor-joining method [55]. Sequences from one representative of each strain and corresponding type strain were used to create the phylogenetic tree. DNA extraction The concentrated environmental samples (3 mL) were split into two equal parts. One half of the sample (1.5 mL) was treated with 12.5 μL of 2 mM PMA dye (Biotum, Inc., Hayward, CA), and the other half was left untreated. The final concentration of PMA in each treated sample was 25 μM. After PMA addition, both treated and untreated samples were kept in the dark for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently exposed to light in the PHaST Blue-Photo activation system for tubes (GenIUL, S.L, Terrassa, Spain) for 15 min. PMA-treated samples represent viable microorganisms whereas the non-PMA-treated samples represent the total number of viable and dead microorganisms [56]. After photo activation, each sample was split into two aliquots of 0.75 mL each. One aliquot of each sample was subjected to bead beating for 60 s at 5 m/s on the Fastprep-24 bead-beating instrument (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA). The solution after bead beating was combined with not bead-beated aliquots (1.5 mL), and then used for DNA extraction using the Maxwell-16 MDx automated system following manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Purified DNA was eluted into a final volume of 50 μL of Ultra Pure molecular water and divided into 4 aliquots that were stored at −80 °C. Molecular fungal community analysis using Illumina sequencing To determine fungal populations, a two-step amplification process was applied prior to MiSeq Illumina sequencing at Research and Testing Laboratory (RTL, Lubbock, TX). The forward primer was constructed with the Illumina i5 sequencing primer (5′-TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG-3′) and the ITS1F primer (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) [57]. The reverse primer was constructed with the Illumina i7 sequencing primer (5′-GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G-3′) and the ITS2aR primer (5′-GCT GCG TTC TTC ATC GAT GC-3′) [58]. Amplifications were performed in 25 μL reactions with Qiagen HotStar Taq master mix (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), 1 μL of each 5 μM primer, and 1 μL of template. Reactions were performed on ABI Veriti thermocyclers (Applied Biosytems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following thermal profile: 95 °C for 5 min, then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min and 4 °C hold. Products from the first stage amplification were added to a second PCR based on qualitatively determined concentrations. Primers for the second PCR were designed based on the Illumina Nextera PCR primers as follows: Forward –AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC AC [i5index] TCG TCG GCA GCG TC and Reverse – CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT [i7index] GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG. The second stage amplification was run the same as the first stage except for 10 cycles. Amplification products were visualized with eGels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Products were then pooled equimolar, and each pool was size selected in two rounds using Agencourt AMPure XP (BeckmanCoulter, Indianapolis, IN) in a 0.7 ratio for both rounds. Size-selected pools were then quantified using the Quibit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies) and loaded on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA) 2 × 300 flow cell at 10 pM. Bioinformatic and statistical analysis of fungal cultivable counts and Illumina sequences To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time and location), the following univariate statistical analyses were carried out (https://www.r-project.org/). The normal distribution of the populations was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and as most were not normally distributed (p value <0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn’s test (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dunn.test/index.html) to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [59]. A total of 8,426,774 raw paired reads were processed with mothur v.1.36.1 [60]. The 250 bp paired reads were merged by aligning the reads and correcting discordant base calls by requiring one of the base calls to have a Phred quality score at least 6 points higher than the other. Sequences shorter than 200 bp, having more than 8 homopolymers or containing ambiguous base pairs were excluded from the dataset. Subsequently, reads were pre-clustered [61] by combining low-abundant sequences that differed by 3 or less bases of a more abundant sequence. Chimeric sequences in each sample were identified by UCHIME [62] and also excluded from the dataset. Reads were classified using the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier II [63] implementation of mothur and UNITE fungal rDNA database [54]. Non-fungal sequences were subsequently removed. ITSx was used to exclude non-ITS sequences from the dataset prior to clustering unaligned sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a distance of 0.03 [64] using mother v.1.36.1. The nearest neighbor (single-linkage) algorithm was used for this. OTUs were classified by using the consensus taxonomy of all sequences assigned [60]. An in-house R-script employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac was used to compare the fungal Illumina data (Additional file 3) [65, 66]. Each dataset consisting of the OTU abundances per sample was rarefied 1000 times to the lowest number of reads, and an average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated. This distance was then utilized to calculate nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) or principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), PERMANOVA (Adonis test), and multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP). In addition, the OTU abundances per sample of each dataset were sum normalized and used to employ either an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a Spearman rank correlation on the statistically significant changing parameters and to generate a heat map (p value 0.05). The change of diversity was measured via the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. OTUs that were unclassified at phylum level were removed. Heat maps were presented at family level. Results Cultivable fungal burden and diversity The culture-based fungal abundance of the ILMAH was estimated for each sampling location with colony-forming unit (CFU) values ranging from below detection limit (BDL) to 104 CFU/m2 (Additional file 4: Table ST1a). The highest abundance of the cultivable fungi was observed during the first sampling (T0) followed by ~1 log decrease in CFU during consecutive sampling events (T13, T20, T30) for each living compartment. High fungal population was noticed in samples collected at T0 (Fig. 2A). When statistically treated, the change in fungal abundance within different time points was significant (T0–T20 p = 0.008 and T0–T30 p = 0.0125) (Additional file 5: Table ST2a). The cultivable fungal population for the lab area was higher than observed in other compartments (Fig. 2B, Additional file 4: Table ST1b). A statistically significant difference was observed between the lab area and the bedroom (p = 0.0021) (Additional file 5: Table ST2b). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Statistical analysis of cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation period at all the locations based on colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. To assess the difference between fungal abundances in cultivable sample categories (based on time—A and location—B), we applied the following univariate statistics. The normal distribution of the populations were tested using Shapiro-Wilk normality test, and as most of them were not normally distributed (p value <0.05), we used a Kruskal-Wallis test coupled to a Dunn’s test to investigate differences in the tested populations. Resulting p values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. A CFU counts before crew occupation T0—a were statistically different from CFU counts at T20 and T30—b, but no statistical difference was observed between T0 and T13 counts—ab. Additionally, no statistical differences were observed between any other time points. B CFU counts in the bedroom—a, differed significantly from the CFU counts in lab—b, but no statistical differences were observed between bedroom and kitchen or toilet—ab. No statistical differences were observed between any other locationsOne hundred seventeen cultivable isolates were collected and identified targeting the ITS region. Screening sequences against the UNITE fungal database enabled identification of 32 species (Fig. 3). Among the cultivable isolates, only five strains had similarity lower than 97% that did not allow identification to the species level. All of the identified species but one—Hydnopolyporus fimbriatus—belong to the Ascomycota division (Fig. 3). The most abundant cultivable species were Cladosporium cladosporioides (16), Epicoccum nigrum (15), Aspergillus tubingensis (13), Aspergillus fumigatus (8), Alternaria tenuissima (7), and Pennicillium brevicompactum (7). P. brevicompactum was the only, out of the most commonly identified species, that was not present at multiple time points but only at T13 sampling (Fig. 3). Abundance of C. cladosporioides colonies increased during the ILMAH occupation whereas the abundance of E. nigrum, A. tubingensis, and A. tenuissima decreased. Another commonly isolated species, A. fumigatus, was not isolated during the last sampling event. Neither field nor sampling device controls showed cultivable isolates. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Cultivable fungal diversity detected through the 30-day habitation period at all the locations based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbor-joining method (bootstrap 1000). In total, 117 isolates were collected 113 of which were successfully sequenced (4 strains either did not show growth or did not respond to the sequencing methods attempted). The numbering of the isolates is explained as follows: F = fungi, first number (0–4) will be the sample collection day (0 = T0, 2 = T13, 3 = T20, 4 = T30), second number (1–8) will be sampling location, and the third number (1–5) is the replicate number of the isolate. For example, F23-02 will be a fungal strain, isolated from T20, at location number 3 and a second isolate. Frequency of isolates is given as a frequency bar after the name of fungus. Colors of the bars correspond to the collection time (single or multiple)Viable and total mycobiome (iTag Illumina-based analysis) The fungal richness of PMA-treated (viable) samples decreased when compared to untreated samples (dead and alive). In PMA-untreated samples, 98 families were detected, whereas OTUs belonging to 41 of these families were not viable. Moreover, both PMA-treated and PMA-untreated samples differed significantly in community relationships (NMDS analysis in Fig. 4, Adonis p value = 0.006 and MRPP, significance of delta = 0.002; A = 0.0419) and their Shannon diversity index indicated a significant reduction (paired T test p = 0.0000012) in viable fungal diversity. Observed differences in the PMA-treated (Fig. 4a, c) and PMA-untreated samples (Fig. 4b, d) indicate that untreated samples are overestimating the observed fungi. This observation was further confirmed when alpha diversity of cultivable, viable, and total mycobiome was plotted over time (Fig. 5). In this research communication, only viable mycobiome was considered and discussed in detail. Illumina-based reads of sampling device and field controls showed negligible signal from DNA contamination and hence not included in the following analysis. Fig. 4.

Open in a new tab Linear representation of alpha diversity averages change over time for cultivable, viable and total mycobiomeViable fungal community structure The most abundant phylum that dominated the viable mycobiome of the ILMAH was Ascomycota (90% of all characterized OTUs) followed by Basidiomycota and unclassified fungi (~4 and ~5%, respectively). Incidence of the fungal OTUs at the family level for various time points and locations are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The dominant Pleosporaceae (75% of all OTUs) along with unclassified fungi (5%) and Davidiellaceae (4%) constituted 84% of all OTUs present in PMA-treated samples (Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 6). A closer look into the genus level of Pleosporaceae family indicated the domination of Epicoccum (92.95% of all OTUs) and Alternaria (6.8%) sequences. The dominant fungal OTUs in the ILMAH biome correspond with the most frequently isolated cultivable fungi (Figs. 3 and 6). Table 1.

Open in a new tab Dominant fungal population and succession patterns observed in 30-day occupation period of the ILMAH system. The OTUs presented in the bar graph are the most abundant. T20 surface samples show different fungal profile when compared to other time points. T30 samples show increase in fungal diversity when compared to other time pointDifferences in the fungal community between samples were analyzed by multivariate statistics using ordination analyses and Monte Carlo-based permutation tests. Viable fungal communities showed similar mycobiome profiles throughout the sampling period except from the samples collected at T20, which were distinct (Fig. 4; Adonis p value = 0.001 and MRPP, significance of delta = 0.001 and A = 0.1168, Additional file 6: Figure SF2 MRPP: chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.1626, significance of delta 0.001; Adonis: delta = 0.019). Interestingly, community profiles were similar between samples collected before crew occupation (T0) and at T13 and T30 (Additional file 7: Figure SF3; chance corrected within-group agreement A: 0.01802, significance of delta: 0.219, Adonis 0.228, Additional file 8: Table ST3). Observed differences in multivariate statistics led to the investigation of mycobiome changes on a single-OTU level. First, an Anova test carried out on samples that did not cluster with the rest (Fig. 4) showed presence of representatives of Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Saccharomycetales, Tremellales, and Trichocomaceae families. Second, throughout the inhabitation, the level of Pleosporaceae showed significant fluctuation—from 96 to 47% and 70% at T0, T20, and T30, respectively (Fig. 7). Additionally, while Pleosporaceae presence decreased to 47%, a significant increase in the levels of Davidiellaceae (22%), Dothioraceae (11%), Saccharomycetales (8%), and Trichocomaceae (8%) was observed when compared to other time points (Fig. 6, Additional file 9: Table ST4). Interestingly, the presence of less abundant families observed before crew occupancy (T0) increased at (T30), i.e., Davidiellaceae (4.45%), Hypocreaceae (1.26%), Phaeosphaeriaceae (3.54%), Teratosphaeriaceae (5.17%), and Sporidiobolales (2.81%), as well as members of new fungal families were observed, i.e., Capnodiales (0.5%), Chaetomiaceae (3.81%), and Peniophoraceae (1.26%) (Table 1 and Fig. 6, Additional file 9: Table ST4). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Box plots of viable dominant fungal families and their succession patterns observed in 30-day occupation period of the ILMAH system. The OTU counts presented in the boxplots are the most abundant. Each time point is represented in a different color: T0—green, T13—orange, T20—red, T30—purple Spearman rank correlation was applied to each OTU’s abundance pattern and sampling event to determine significant correlation of viable fungal families with various time points. The results presented as a heat map contain 13 OTUs that showed a significant correlation with a p value of 0.01 and 32 OTUs with a p value of 0.05. All OTUs but Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Tremellales_3, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae were more abundant during the sampling before the crew inhabited the ILMAH (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Heat map of the taxa that showed a significant correlation (p value 0.01) with the factor time in the PMA-treated sample set. The color blue indicates a low abundance of the single OTU in the respective sample, and orange indicates a high abundance of the single OTU in the respective sample. Each column represents one sample collected throughout the study. The numbering pattern is explained as follows 30 means 30-day study. The first number (0–4) will be the sample collection day (0 = T0, 2 = T13, 3 = T20, 4 = T30), second number (1–8) will be sampling location, and P stands for PMA-treated samples. For example, 30.06P will be a sample collected during the 30-day study from T0 at location 6Further investigation of OTU abundances on the genus level revealed changes in OTU counts over the course of time. The numbers of OTUs identified as Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, and Cryptococcus fluctuated from high abundance at T0 to significantly lower counts at T20 and then counts increased again at T30. OTUs identified as Davidiella increased throughout the occupation time whereas OTU counts for Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, and Candida were increasing over time (peak at T20) with a drastic decrease at T30. Location wise before the ILMAH occupation, all compartments exhibited high abundance of Epiccocum OTUs that decreased over time and again increased at T30. Alternaria OTUs were less abundant than the ones identified as Epiccocum genus. Nevertheless, they showed the same fluctuation pattern in all compartments but bedroom. While accumulation of Davidiella OTU counts was observed in bedroom and lab, the OTU counts in the bathroom did not differ between the T0 and T30. At the same time, accumulation of Davidiella OTUs was observed in the kitchen with the highest abundance during the T20 sampling event. To sum up, statistical analysis revealed differences in community structure between time points in particular between T20 and any other previous or following time point. Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Tremellales_3, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae families were shown to increase over the occupation time period. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance.Discussion Understanding microbial characteristic of a controlled habitat, like the ILMAH, may facilitate discerning the microbial population dynamics as well as the development of appropriate countermeasures. Knowledge about the viable mycobiome will not only allow the development of required maintenance and cleaning procedures in the closed habitat but also prevent it from deteriorating and being a potential health hazard for its inhabitants [67]. Multiple studies have shown that use of propidium monoazide (PMA), a dye that can penetrate the compromised cell walls, enables more accurate analysis of the viable microbiome [68, 69]. It was also shown that PMA treatment might be successfully applied to determine dead and viable counts for various fungal species [70, 71]. As in this study, other report proved that DNA from dead cells, when not removed from samples, before molecular analyses, might overshadow the actual diversity since presence of less abundant microbial species were masked [32]. PMA-treated and PMA-untreated samples varied significantly in the ILMAH fungal community structures (p value = 0.006), and it had been reported before that low abundant species were detected in PMA-treated samples for bacteria, fungi, and viruses [66]. This approach validated the importance of PMA treatment to accurately determine the viable mycobiome of environmental samples. As a result, this study discussed only viable fungal communities to determine succession patterns and community structure over the course of time. Various studies showed the positive correlation between changes in the indoor bacteriome and human presence [7, 28, 30, 66, 72] whereas such observation was not confirmed for the mycobiome [29, 30, 73]. Major sources of indoor microbiome were reported to be associated with human skin commensals transmitted via shoes, clothes, coughing, and talking [74, 75]. It was also shown that the indoor mycobiome was mostly influenced by airborne fungi rather than human presence and their shedding, despite the fact that fungi were associated with human skin, lungs, urogenital tract, oral nasal cavities, and the gut [30, 76–79]. In addition, few studies demonstrated that key determinants for mycobiome indoors might be the age of the built-in environments and the relative humidity, which can enhance fungal growth [80]. A recent 6-month survey on Japanese astronauts on the ISS revealed that the most abundant (dead or alive) fungal genus was Malassezia [10] whereas in this study, the most frequent viable fungal genera of closed habitat were Epiccocum, Alternaria, and Pleosporales, which are environmental organisms rather than human commensals. The presence of fungi inside the closed habitat, houses, or any types of man-made buildings was correlated with the amount of the water (relative humidity; RH) present in the environment [80]. The environmental relative moldiness index (ERMI) increases with elevated amounts of water [81]. The most abundant genera in common households were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Epicoccum whereas Aspergillus and Penicillium were predominant in water-damaged building [81]. Similarly, in this study (measured RH 32 to 55%), the most abundant fungal genera were Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, and Cryptococcus, which could be compared with the previous observations for common households. Nevertheless, genera present in houses and closed habitats could have an impact on human health. These molds were associated with allergies and asthma [67, 82]. Elevated level of fungal allergenic molecules, such as enzymes, toxins, cell-wall components, and cross-reactive proteins could induce type I hypersensitivity [67]. Additionally, because of their ability to colonize the human body and produce toxins, volatile organic compounds, and proteases, the common molds (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epicoccum) could damage airways of immunocompromised occupants, which make them more dangerous than any other allergenic source [82–85]. In this study, accumulation of Alternaria and Epicoccum genera over time was observed, which, in combination with reported decreased immunity in occupants of confined spaces, e.g., astronauts [50, 86] could lead to developing allergy and asthma symptoms. Throughout this study, the abundance of dominant Pleosporaceae family members decreased (94% at T0 to 71% at T30), while other fungal families were observed to increase, possibly as a result of human presence. However, positive correlation between increased fungal diversity and human presence requires studying the mycobiome of the occupants. It might be possible that the implemented cleaning procedures including weekly dusting, sweeping, wet mopping the floor, and antibacterial wipes resulted in suppressed growth of Pleosporaceae members over the time. The community structure observed at T20 was distinct from other time points. Detailed logging data collected during 30-day mission did not show any abnormal accidents or cleaning activities preceding T20 sampling. The recorded data indicated that cleaning was conducted between the sampling events (~4–5 days prior to sampling). However, the inhabiting crew might have inadvertently cleaned just prior to T20 sampling and that might have removed both total and viable fungal populations (Table 1). The significant increase of Davidiellaceae (22%), Dothioraceae (11%), Saccharomycetales (8%), and Trichocomaceae (8%) sequences at T20 might be due to the fact that under-represented members became available for PCR reaction among the competing dominant fungal DNA. Both Cladosporium sp. members of Davidiellaceae family and Aurobasidium sp. of Dothioraceae family have the capacity to survive extreme environments like the ice of the Antarctica [87] or radioactive explosion site of Chernobyl Power Plant accident [88]. Additionally, Cladosporium sp. and Aureobasidium pullulans were isolated from hypersaline waters with NaCl concentration reaching 25% indicating high osmotolerance [89, 90]. Penicillium sp. of Trichocomaceae family isolated from high-altitude soil in Indian Himalaya has been shown to tolerate a wide range of pH from 2 to 14 and a salt concentration between 10 and 20% [91]. Most of the Apergillus sp. of Trichocomaceae family is soil fungi or saprophytes [92], but there has been a recent report of isolation of A. fumigatus from ISS [32]. In-depth analysis of isolate ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 revealed increased UV resistance (in preparation) and virulence in neutrophil-deficient larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis [93]. All in all, the capacity to survive in such extreme environments might help the observed in the study Davidiellaceae, Dothioraceae, and Trichocomaceae species to adjust and survive hostile conditions of the ILMAH.Conclusions Accumulation of viable mycobiome during the experiment duration and differences in fungal community profiles were observed. On a genus level, Epiccocum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time. Unlike results of molecular analyses, cultivable fungi counts decreased over time. Epicoccum nigrum was the most dominant cultivable isolate; however, most of the fungal species detected via molecular approach were not cultured. During human presence, the overall fungal diversity has changed, that in the long run, may lead to a conclusion that proper maintenance protocols of a closed habitat may be required to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.Additional files Additional file 1: Figure SF1.

    "abstract": "Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. Subject terms: Microbiome, Biofilms",
    "introduction": "Introduction Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6. Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11. The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example, Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobiales recovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40. Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observed Burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth.",
    "methods": "Methods Strains and culture conditions Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Lists of ISS potable water isolates archived by NASA from the US water system between 2009 and 2015 were obtained online44. Diversity assessments using these publicly available data were performed as described in the text. Potable water isolates used in this study from early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years were provided by NASA JSC on commercial R2A media. Strains were cultured at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber for 1–10 days on the following solid media: TSA (MP biomedicals, 091010717; Difco 214530), R2A agar (Becton, Dickinson, 218263), or mR2A agar (modified R2A agar; Teknova, R0005; Difco 214530). Prior to each experiment (for all strains), single colonies were isolated on R2A agar (1.5% agar) or mR2A agar (1.3% agar) from frozen stocks, and individual strains were cultured in R2A broth (Teknova, R0005) at room temperature to stationary phase of growth. The growth kinetics of each strain were determined at the beginning of the study to confirm that experiments were all performed at the same phase of growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Strains were individually cultured to stationary phase in R2A broth, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. We chose to test a range of antibiotic concentrations in our study based on literature searches, which included (a) concentrations commonly used for the same or similar organisms, including minimum inhibitory concentrations, and (b) reports that spaceflight can profoundly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of some bacteria86,87. Diluted and undiluted samples were plated on mR2A plates containing antibiotic(s) or NaCl at specified concentrations and incubated at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber. The AST plates were monitored for approximately one week and bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. Tenfold dilutions of a pure culture were plated on R2A agar media containing specific concentrations of antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility was scored by testing the log decrease in bacterial survival, from 0 (no to <1 log-fold decrease) to 7 (7 or more log-fold decrease) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines (Supplementary Fig. 5b)45. Energy-metabolism tests The casein-PR agar media used for metabolism testing contained 1% Casein (Sigma-Aldrich, 22090), 0.5% NaCl (S3014), 0.15% Bacto Yeast extract (BD, 212750), 0.008% Phenol red (PR, Sigma-Aldrich, P4758), and 1.3% agar. For additional supplements, 1% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) or 1% lactose (Sigma, 61345) was added to the casein-PR media. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. Biofilm tests mR2A plates containing Congo red (Sigma–Aldrich, C6767) 100 µg/ml, or crystal violet 100 µg/ml, were prepared. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. For air–liquid-surface biofilms, individual strains were inoculated in 5 mL of R2A broth, standing and development of biofilms were monitored for eight weeks. Photos were taken at eight weeks post inoculation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sample preparations Biofilms were developed on sterile glass cover slips in broth cultures of each individual strain for 24 h at RT. Cover slips containing pure culture biofilms were subsequently washed with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 mins, following gentle washing with cold DPBS twice. In a limited-light environment, the samples were stained with SYTO-9 green fluorescent stain (10 mg/mL, nucleic acid stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific S34854) for 15 min, Concanavalin A conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (500 mg/L, α-polysaccharide stain), Ethidium Homodimer-2 (EthD2, 1 mg/mL, dead-cell stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific E3599), or Fluorescent Brightener 28/Calcofluor White (0.7 mg/mL, β-polysaccharide stain, Sigma F3543) for five minutes. Biofilms were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 LSCM with sequential scanning. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. Three to six stacks of horizontal plane images (1024 × 1024 pixels) with a z-step of 3 μm (the distance between the images) were acquired for each sample from two or more randomly chosen areas. Two independent experiments were performed. Fluorescence images were acquired with excitation at 405 nm (1.57%), 488 nm (4.98%), 514 nm (10.1%), or 633 nm (3.1%); emission filter DAPI (420–460 nm), FITC (498–545 nm), mCherry (565–610 nm), or Alexa-644 (648–700 nm) and gain 540.2 V (PMT), 60% (HyD), 65% (HyD), or 60% (HyD). Image scanning was carried out by sequential scanning with seq-1 (405-nm laser, pinhole 0.31), seq-2 (488 nm and 633 nm, pinhole 0.32), and seq-3 (514 nm, pinhole 0.31). Hemolysis test Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies, but instead used blood agar (BA; TSA with sheep blood, Fisher R01200). The plates were incubated and monitored for 15–72 h. Interspecies and mixed-species interaction testing Individual strains were grown in R2A broth as described above. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh R2A broth to concentrate by 10 times. To assess interactions between designated strains, 10-µl samples of each isolate were dropped onto R2A agar (1.5%) at the same time at a distance close enough to allow for interaction but far enough away to avoid fusion of the droplets. Pairwise combinations of every strain in this study were examined. For mixed-species assays, samples were prepared in the same way to test the interaction between two strains. Equal volumes of the 10X- concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop-applied on R2A agar (1.5%). Different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species. Incubation, monitoring, and recording were conducted as described above. Data collection, data analysis, and statistical analysis For most assays (except hemolysis and CLSM), microbial growth on plates was monitored over seven days by taking photos and recording observations every 1–2 days, mostly due to the varying growth speeds for different strains. All assays presented in this paper were repeated at least in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 or Microsoft Excel. Mean value and error bars (standard error of the mean) are indicated.

    "results": "Results Population analysis of archived ISS potable water microbiota To investigate dynamic changes in microbial species in the ISS Water Recovery System since its installation in 200813, we analyzed a NASA-provided list of ISS potable water isolates preserved between 2009 and 201544. Seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified Gram-negative rods were represented from the list, which included a total of 117 potable water isolates. All microbial genera are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order (Fig. 1a–b). We further calculated the microbial diversity for each year by dividing the number of different species isolated in a year by the total number of isolates recovered in the year (Supplementary Table 2). We found that changes in the microbial species diversity inversely correlated with both Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp. over time, with the relationship more strongly associated with the former than the latter (Fig. 1c). The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated each year (Fig. 1b). To investigate how microbial communities in the ISS potable water system may have changed over time, we selected different species of ISS water microbiota isolated in early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years for further phenotypic analysis, to better understand targeted population shifts that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems (Table 1).

The complete list of antimicrobial compounds, tested concentrations, and test results is shown in Supplementary Dataset 1. All strains were resistant to multiple drugs at the concentrations tested for this study, most of which agreed with known–intrinsic drug resistance for the specific genus and/or species45. In particular, Bcc and Mesorhizobium isolates were highly resistant to most of the tested antibiotics. Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and Bcc isolates showed similar trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. Sphingomonas sanguinis isolates were highly sensitive to vancomycin and many antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis. Methylobacterium and Bradyrhizobium showed similar drug-resistant trends with the exception of carbenicillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus epidermidis was highly sensitive to most tested antibiotics. Many of the tested isolates were sensitive to NaCl concentrations over 1%, except Bcc and S. epidermidis (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the ISS potable water isolates, pure cultures. Open in a new tab Summary of antimicrobial susceptibility of ISS potable water isolates is shown. Shading in gray scale from black to white indicates responses ranging from resistant to sensitive, respectively. The data from representative concentrations for selected antimicrobials, commonly used for Gram-negative bacteria, are shown. The complete results are in Supplementary Dataset 1. Preferred energy source of ISS potable water isolates We also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the ISS isolates. We used agar media containing both casein amino acids and either sucrose or lactose, as well as the pH indicator phenol red. Most species appeared to prefer casein amino acids over either carbohydrate (indicated by the pink color around the colonies) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, C. metallidurans and R. pickettii formed a wrinkled/rugose colony morphology, which is a common biofilm phenotype46, while R. insidiosa produced very smooth colonies (Fig. 3b). We thus decided to further examine biofilm formation of the isolates. Fig. 3. Characteristics of pure cultures of ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab a Core metabolic characteristics and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The media contains casein and phenol red with 1% lactose or 1% sucrose. Pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids in the presence of both. The colony phenotype on R2A media serves as control. EPS production is indicated with red colonies by 100 μg/ml Congo red. b Rugose/wrinkled colony morphology. Biofilm formation and production of extracellular substances Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including extracellular DNA (eDNA), protein, and extracellular polysaccharides, are known to be fundamental components of biofilm growth47–50. To detect EPS production by the ISS potable water isolates, we grew bacterial colonies on media containing either Congo red or crystal violet to stain the extracellular substances. Media containing Congo red revealed that strains of R. pickettii, S. sanguinis, Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium spp., and S. epidermidis were strong EPS producers with bright-red colonies (Fig. 4a). The crystal violet-containing agar also indicated biofilm formation. We thus further validated biofilm formation using an air–liquid-surface approach for Methylobacterium, Mesorhizobium, R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 4b). All of the tested strains (except R. insidiosa) provided phenotypic evidence of biofilm formation with rugose/wrinkle colonies, EPS production, and/or air–liquid-interface biofilms. Fig. 4. Biofilm-formation tests. Open in a new tab a The R2A media contains 100 μg/ml Congo red (CR) or 100 μg/ml crystal violet (CV), or no dye addition (control).

Similar concentrations of bacteria, approximately 106–107 CFU, were plated. b The 8-week-old biofilms on air–liquid surface (arrow). Brightness and contrast of pictures were similarly optimized for clarity. Biofilm ultrastructure, composition, and cellular morphology We used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to examine biofilm structures and production of the biofilm-related EPS (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). Single-strain biofilms were developed on sterile microscope glass cover slides. Live or dead bacterial cells, EPS compounds, and α- or β-linked polysaccharides were labeled by fluorescent dyes. The dyes used were SYTO-9 (green nucleic acid stain), ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2) (orange-dead cell stain), concanavalin A (ConA) (magenta α-linked polysaccharide stain), or calcofluor white (CFW) (blue β-linked polysaccharide stain). Figure 5 shows microscopic imaging of the bacterial spatial organization, biofilm-associated substances, and morphology of biofilms (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). The organisms show different biofilm patterns as evidenced by Con A, CFW, and viability staining. In particular, S. sanguinis, Ralstonia, and C. metallidurans formed large clustered biofilms (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While Methylobacterium spp. grew 1–2 logs less in planktonic culture as compared with other species (Supplementary Fig. 2), they formed relatively thick biofilm layers on glass (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, our data showed that CFW appeared to stain individual bacterial cell surfaces, while ConA appeared to target biofilm matrix components. eDNA was also present in the matrix as evidenced by EthD-2 staining. Fig. 5. CLSM analysis of static biofilm on glass surfaces formed by ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab Single-species biofilms were developed statically on glass surface. Cells and EPS compounds were labeled by fluorescent dyes SYTO-9 (green), EthHD-2 (orange), CFW (blue), and ConA-alexa 633 (magenta). Biofilm structures and the composition were observed by CLSM. Scale bars indicate 5 µm. Identification of intraspecies variations and hemolytic Burkholderia species During the course of our studies, we observed that some ISS isolates of the same species, which were recovered in different years, showed evidence of possible intraspecies variation. Specifically, we found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 6a–b). Visual inspection of the 2014 R. pickettii isolates and the 2009 S. sanguinis isolates indicated that they may produce more EPS relative to the same species recovered in different years, suggesting intraspecies variation. In addition, we discovered hemolytic activity of select Burkholderia isolates. Specifically, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates displayed hemolytic activity, while the 2012 isolates did not (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, our data revealed that the 2014 Burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology (Fig. 6dright). Both hemolytic (α and β) and nonhemolytic (γ) colonies were simultaneously found on the same blood agar plate. In addition, both yellow and gray colonies simultaneously appeared on modified R2A (mR2A) agar and gray colonies were visibly more mucoid, suggesting varying mucus/pigment production among individual colonies (Fig. 6dleft). Moreover, the passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype. The different colony types shown in Fig. 6d were indistinguishable from each other based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (data provided by NASA), confirming that these morphologically distinct colonies were not contaminants. These differences in colony characteristics might be explained by recent sequencing data showing that the 2012 and 2014 Burkholderia ISS potable water isolates are different species43. The intraspecies differences in 2014 Burkholderia colony morphology and pigment were not observed using commercially available R2A, TSA, or LB agar media. Surprisingly, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates that exhibited β-hemolysis also tested positive for beta-galactosidase, urease, and D-trehalose, which are uncommon for Bcc strains (Supplementary Table 3).

The left picture shows yellow or pale-gray color colonies indicated with arrows. On the right image, the α-, β-, and γ-hemolysis are indicated with arrows demonstrating no-, weak-, and complete lysis of red cells, respectively. Interspecies interactions To better understand microbial relationships between different species that may occur in the ISS potable water system, we examined interactions between these species. Individual strains were spotted onto R2A agar directly adjacent to different species to assess the interactions between every possible combination of paired isolates (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interspecies interactions between the paired isolates over a progressive time course were rated as negative, positive, or neutral, based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity (Fig. 7). Neutral relationships were defined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction. Positive relationships were defined when one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other strain (Fig. 7c). We found two types of negative behaviors. For example, Methylobacterium and S. epidermidis were either killed or their growth inhibited by Burkholderia (Fig. 7a), while R. insidiosa grew away from Burkholderia (Fig. 7b). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, which are both slow-growing bacteria and thus could be potentially less competitive relative to faster-growing species, displayed no growth defect when interacting with most strains, thus showing neutral relationships (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7. Types of interspecies interactions and their progressive changes over time. Open in a new tab Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. Interaction criteria were based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity. Rows a and b show negative interactions, where one organism killed/inhibited (a, yellow arrows) or grew away from the other strain (b, red arrows). Row c shows positive interaction, where one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other (blue arrows). Row d shows neutral interaction, where no visible sign of interaction was observed between the organisms. The colonies on the left and right in each panel are respectively: a, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Staphylococcus spp.; b, 2012 Burkholderia spp. and 2012 Ralstonia spp.; c, 2012 Ralstonia spp. and 2012 Sphingomonas spp.; d, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Bradyrhizobium spp.We also observed a correlation between isolation year and the type of interspecies interaction between R. insidiosa and either S. sanguinis or Methylobacterium. For these strains in our study, species isolated in the same year exhibited positive relationships, while neutral relationships were observed when species from different years were cocultured (Fig. 8a–b). Fig. 8. Interspecies interactions may be influenced by the year of isolation. Open in a new tab a Distinct relationships observed between strains isolated in the same year but not in different years. R, S, or M indicate R. insidiosa, S. sanguinis, or Methylobacterium spp., respectively. Red dotted lines highlight where Ralstonia spp. have grown out toward and surround the other species. b Correlation between the isolation year and interactions between different species exhibiting positive or neutral relationships. The years isolated are indicated above colonies, shown in the same color. Mixed-species colony biofilms We performed mixed-species colony biofilm assays to examine microbial multispecies behavior by combining different strains isolated in the same year and then plating these mixed cultures as a single colony. Strains were first individually cultured in liquid media, then equal ratios of either (1) two species from the same year, or (2) all isolates from each year (2009, 2012, or 2014) were mixed and spotted as a single colony onto R2A agar to compare the characteristics of colony biofilms. The morphologies of these mixed-species colonies were monitored for 10 days. Distinct phenotypes were observed for each mixed-species colony that resembled the dominant species in the mixture, but still differed from the morphology of the individual strains (Supplementary Fig. 4). S. sanguinis, C. metallidurans, R. insidiosa, or Burkholderia tended to exhibit relatively dominant phenotypes as evidenced by colony color or morphology. Methylobacterium spp., which previously showed growth inhibition when spotted next to a Burkholderia colony (Supplementary Fig. 3), did not show visible signs of growth in the colony when directly mixed with Burkholderia.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days). Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments51–53. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions8,54. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance10,11. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed that Ralstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016. Microbes interact with their neighbors in mixed communities and compete for space and resources in diverse environments55–59. Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology60–64. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al.64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions65–67. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients68–71. A recent longitudinal study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades72,73. Using bacterial isolates recovered over time from the same ISS potable water system, we observed positive, negative, or neutral interspecies relationships with temporal dependent interspecies interactions observed between certain strains. As the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0.2-micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely8,15,74. Thus, the isolates collected at any given sampling timepoint may reflect bacteria that have coexisted for extended time periods. As these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year (e.g., 2009) may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years (e.g., 2012, 2014). Our data corroborate this possibility. Based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed interspecies interactions that might have developed during spaceflight (Fig. 9). We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. Regardless, data from this study provide a foundation from which to advance our understanding of multispecies microbial communities and their functional interactions in the ISS potable water system over time, which could impact crew health and system performance. Fig. 9. Hypothetical microbial coevolution model associated with interspecies interactions of ISS water isolates indicates potential formation of new relationships over time. Open in a new tab A and B indicate different bacterial genera. It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease28,29,31,34,35,75–78. Our observation of hemolytic Burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al.43 and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings43 by profiling the type of hemolysis (α, β, γ) in the Burkholderia isolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth79–82. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation61. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms31,61,64. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms. Our data also revealed distinct patterns of biofilm formation by the ISS potable water isolates that may be representative of the different species tested in this study. One potential explanation of the diverse biofilm patterns observed may be the different extracellular matrix components, as revealed by ConA and CFW staining, which stain α- and β-linked polysaccharides, respectively. We also observed that EthD-2, which does not penetrate the membrane of living cells, was observed at unexpectedly high levels in S. sanguinis, Ralstonia spp., C. metallidurans, Methylobacterium, and S. epidermidis. The increased EthD-2 signal in these cells may reflect eDNA in the biofilms, as has been previously shown with similar species47,83–85. We plan to conduct future studies to identify the mechanisms involved in these bacterial interactions and biofilm formation. Our longitudinal study provides a comprehensive phenotypic investigation of ISS potable water microbial isolates, focusing on functional characteristics of the different species alone or as multispecies consortia. As joint molecular and phenotypic analyses can provide a more comprehensive understanding of polymicrobial interactions and function than either approach alone, we are currently investigating molecular mechanisms that may explain some of the functional phenotypes that were observed for several of the ISS isolates in this study. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 8421509 PMID: 34489467 Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. Subject terms: Microbiome, BiofilmsIntroduction Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities. However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms1–5. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure6. Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11. The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example, Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobiales recovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40. Previous studies using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches have reported findings regarding microbial composition and concentrations in ISS potable water18,41–43. To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings43, we also observed Burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth.Results Population analysis of archived ISS potable water microbiota To investigate dynamic changes in microbial species in the ISS Water Recovery System since its installation in 200813, we analyzed a NASA-provided list of ISS potable water isolates preserved between 2009 and 201544. Seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified Gram-negative rods were represented from the list, which included a total of 117 potable water isolates. All microbial genera are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order (Fig. 1a–b). We further calculated the microbial diversity for each year by dividing the number of different species isolated in a year by the total number of isolates recovered in the year (Supplementary Table 2). We found that changes in the microbial species diversity inversely correlated with both Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp. over time, with the relationship more strongly associated with the former than the latter (Fig. 1c). The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated each year (Fig. 1b). To investigate how microbial communities in the ISS potable water system may have changed over time, we selected different species of ISS water microbiota isolated in early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years for further phenotypic analysis, to better understand targeted population shifts that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems (Table 1).

The complete list of antimicrobial compounds, tested concentrations, and test results is shown in Supplementary Dataset 1. All strains were resistant to multiple drugs at the concentrations tested for this study, most of which agreed with known–intrinsic drug resistance for the specific genus and/or species45. In particular, Bcc and Mesorhizobium isolates were highly resistant to most of the tested antibiotics. Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and Bcc isolates showed similar trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. Sphingomonas sanguinis isolates were highly sensitive to vancomycin and many antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis. Methylobacterium and Bradyrhizobium showed similar drug-resistant trends with the exception of carbenicillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus epidermidis was highly sensitive to most tested antibiotics. Many of the tested isolates were sensitive to NaCl concentrations over 1%, except Bcc and S. epidermidis (Supplementary Dataset 1). Fig. 2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the ISS potable water isolates, pure cultures. Open in a new tab Summary of antimicrobial susceptibility of ISS potable water isolates is shown. Shading in gray scale from black to white indicates responses ranging from resistant to sensitive, respectively. The data from representative concentrations for selected antimicrobials, commonly used for Gram-negative bacteria, are shown. The complete results are in Supplementary Dataset 1.Preferred energy source of ISS potable water isolates We also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the ISS isolates. We used agar media containing both casein amino acids and either sucrose or lactose, as well as the pH indicator phenol red. Most species appeared to prefer casein amino acids over either carbohydrate (indicated by the pink color around the colonies) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, C. metallidurans and R. pickettii formed a wrinkled/rugose colony morphology, which is a common biofilm phenotype46, while R. insidiosa produced very smooth colonies (Fig. 3b). We thus decided to further examine biofilm formation of the isolates. Fig. 3. Characteristics of pure cultures of ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab a Core metabolic characteristics and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The media contains casein and phenol red with 1% lactose or 1% sucrose. Pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids in the presence of both. The colony phenotype on R2A media serves as control. EPS production is indicated with red colonies by 100 μg/ml Congo red. b Rugose/wrinkled colony morphology.Biofilm formation and production of extracellular substances Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including extracellular DNA (eDNA), protein, and extracellular polysaccharides, are known to be fundamental components of biofilm growth47–50. To detect EPS production by the ISS potable water isolates, we grew bacterial colonies on media containing either Congo red or crystal violet to stain the extracellular substances. Media containing Congo red revealed that strains of R. pickettii, S. sanguinis, Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium spp., and S. epidermidis were strong EPS producers with bright-red colonies (Fig. 4a). The crystal violet-containing agar also indicated biofilm formation. We thus further validated biofilm formation using an air–liquid-surface approach for Methylobacterium, Mesorhizobium, R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 4b). All of the tested strains (except R. insidiosa) provided phenotypic evidence of biofilm formation with rugose/wrinkle colonies, EPS production, and/or air–liquid-interface biofilms. Fig. 4. Biofilm-formation tests. Open in a new tab a The R2A media contains 100 μg/ml Congo red (CR) or 100 μg/ml crystal violet (CV), or no dye addition (control).

Similar concentrations of bacteria, approximately 106–107 CFU, were plated. b The 8-week-old biofilms on air–liquid surface (arrow). Brightness and contrast of pictures were similarly optimized for clarity.Biofilm ultrastructure, composition, and cellular morphology We used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to examine biofilm structures and production of the biofilm-related EPS (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). Single-strain biofilms were developed on sterile microscope glass cover slides. Live or dead bacterial cells, EPS compounds, and α- or β-linked polysaccharides were labeled by fluorescent dyes. The dyes used were SYTO-9 (green nucleic acid stain), ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2) (orange-dead cell stain), concanavalin A (ConA) (magenta α-linked polysaccharide stain), or calcofluor white (CFW) (blue β-linked polysaccharide stain). Figure 5 shows microscopic imaging of the bacterial spatial organization, biofilm-associated substances, and morphology of biofilms (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). The organisms show different biofilm patterns as evidenced by Con A, CFW, and viability staining. In particular, S. sanguinis, Ralstonia, and C. metallidurans formed large clustered biofilms (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While Methylobacterium spp. grew 1–2 logs less in planktonic culture as compared with other species (Supplementary Fig. 2), they formed relatively thick biofilm layers on glass (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, our data showed that CFW appeared to stain individual bacterial cell surfaces, while ConA appeared to target biofilm matrix components. eDNA was also present in the matrix as evidenced by EthD-2 staining. Fig. 5. CLSM analysis of static biofilm on glass surfaces formed by ISS potable water isolates. Open in a new tab Single-species biofilms were developed statically on glass surface. Cells and EPS compounds were labeled by fluorescent dyes SYTO-9 (green), EthHD-2 (orange), CFW (blue), and ConA-alexa 633 (magenta). Biofilm structures and the composition were observed by CLSM. Scale bars indicate 5 µm.Identification of intraspecies variations and hemolytic Burkholderia species During the course of our studies, we observed that some ISS isolates of the same species, which were recovered in different years, showed evidence of possible intraspecies variation. Specifically, we found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 6a–b). Visual inspection of the 2014 R. pickettii isolates and the 2009 S. sanguinis isolates indicated that they may produce more EPS relative to the same species recovered in different years, suggesting intraspecies variation. In addition, we discovered hemolytic activity of select Burkholderia isolates. Specifically, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates displayed hemolytic activity, while the 2012 isolates did not (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, our data revealed that the 2014 Burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology (Fig. 6dright). Both hemolytic (α and β) and nonhemolytic (γ) colonies were simultaneously found on the same blood agar plate. In addition, both yellow and gray colonies simultaneously appeared on modified R2A (mR2A) agar and gray colonies were visibly more mucoid, suggesting varying mucus/pigment production among individual colonies (Fig. 6dleft). Moreover, the passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype. The different colony types shown in Fig. 6d were indistinguishable from each other based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (data provided by NASA), confirming that these morphologically distinct colonies were not contaminants. These differences in colony characteristics might be explained by recent sequencing data showing that the 2012 and 2014 Burkholderia ISS potable water isolates are different species43. The intraspecies differences in 2014 Burkholderia colony morphology and pigment were not observed using commercially available R2A, TSA, or LB agar media. Surprisingly, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates that exhibited β-hemolysis also tested positive for beta-galactosidase, urease, and D-trehalose, which are uncommon for Bcc strains (Supplementary Table 3).

The left picture shows yellow or pale-gray color colonies indicated with arrows. On the right image, the α-, β-, and γ-hemolysis are indicated with arrows demonstrating no-, weak-, and complete lysis of red cells, respectively.Interspecies interactions To better understand microbial relationships between different species that may occur in the ISS potable water system, we examined interactions between these species. Individual strains were spotted onto R2A agar directly adjacent to different species to assess the interactions between every possible combination of paired isolates (Supplementary Fig. 3). Interspecies interactions between the paired isolates over a progressive time course were rated as negative, positive, or neutral, based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity (Fig. 7). Neutral relationships were defined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction. Positive relationships were defined when one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other strain (Fig. 7c). We found two types of negative behaviors. For example, Methylobacterium and S. epidermidis were either killed or their growth inhibited by Burkholderia (Fig. 7a), while R. insidiosa grew away from Burkholderia (Fig. 7b). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, which are both slow-growing bacteria and thus could be potentially less competitive relative to faster-growing species, displayed no growth defect when interacting with most strains, thus showing neutral relationships (Fig. 7d). Fig. 7. Types of interspecies interactions and their progressive changes over time. Open in a new tab Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. Interaction criteria were based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity. Rows a and b show negative interactions, where one organism killed/inhibited (a, yellow arrows) or grew away from the other strain (b, red arrows). Row c shows positive interaction, where one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other (blue arrows). Row d shows neutral interaction, where no visible sign of interaction was observed between the organisms. The colonies on the left and right in each panel are respectively: a, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Staphylococcus spp.; b, 2012 Burkholderia spp. and 2012 Ralstonia spp.; c, 2012 Ralstonia spp. and 2012 Sphingomonas spp.; d, 2014 Burkholderia spp. and 2014 Bradyrhizobium spp.We also observed a correlation between isolation year and the type of interspecies interaction between R. insidiosa and either S. sanguinis or Methylobacterium. For these strains in our study, species isolated in the same year exhibited positive relationships, while neutral relationships were observed when species from different years were cocultured (Fig. 8a–b). Fig. 8. Interspecies interactions may be influenced by the year of isolation. Open in a new tab a Distinct relationships observed between strains isolated in the same year but not in different years. R, S, or M indicate R. insidiosa, S. sanguinis, or Methylobacterium spp., respectively. Red dotted lines highlight where Ralstonia spp. have grown out toward and surround the other species. b Correlation between the isolation year and interactions between different species exhibiting positive or neutral relationships. The years isolated are indicated above colonies, shown in the same color.Mixed-species colony biofilms We performed mixed-species colony biofilm assays to examine microbial multispecies behavior by combining different strains isolated in the same year and then plating these mixed cultures as a single colony. Strains were first individually cultured in liquid media, then equal ratios of either (1) two species from the same year, or (2) all isolates from each year (2009, 2012, or 2014) were mixed and spotted as a single colony onto R2A agar to compare the characteristics of colony biofilms. The morphologies of these mixed-species colonies were monitored for 10 days. Distinct phenotypes were observed for each mixed-species colony that resembled the dominant species in the mixture, but still differed from the morphology of the individual strains (Supplementary Fig. 4). S. sanguinis, C. metallidurans, R. insidiosa, or Burkholderia tended to exhibit relatively dominant phenotypes as evidenced by colony color or morphology. Methylobacterium spp., which previously showed growth inhibition when spotted next to a Burkholderia colony (Supplementary Fig. 3), did not show visible signs of growth in the colony when directly mixed with Burkholderia.Discussion Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days). Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments51–53. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions8,54. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance10,11. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed that Ralstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016. Microbes interact with their neighbors in mixed communities and compete for space and resources in diverse environments55–59. Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology60–64. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al.64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions65–67. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients68–71. A recent longitudinal study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades72,73. Using bacterial isolates recovered over time from the same ISS potable water system, we observed positive, negative, or neutral interspecies relationships with temporal dependent interspecies interactions observed between certain strains. As the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0.2-micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely8,15,74. Thus, the isolates collected at any given sampling timepoint may reflect bacteria that have coexisted for extended time periods. As these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year (e.g., 2009) may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years (e.g., 2012, 2014). Our data corroborate this possibility. Based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed interspecies interactions that might have developed during spaceflight (Fig. 9). We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. Regardless, data from this study provide a foundation from which to advance our understanding of multispecies microbial communities and their functional interactions in the ISS potable water system over time, which could impact crew health and system performance. Fig. 9. Hypothetical microbial coevolution model associated with interspecies interactions of ISS water isolates indicates potential formation of new relationships over time. Open in a new tab A and B indicate different bacterial genera.It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease28,29,31,34,35,75–78. Our observation of hemolytic Burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al.43 and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings43 by profiling the type of hemolysis (α, β, γ) in the Burkholderia isolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth79–82. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation61. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms31,61,64. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms. Our data also revealed distinct patterns of biofilm formation by the ISS potable water isolates that may be representative of the different species tested in this study. One potential explanation of the diverse biofilm patterns observed may be the different extracellular matrix components, as revealed by ConA and CFW staining, which stain α- and β-linked polysaccharides, respectively. We also observed that EthD-2, which does not penetrate the membrane of living cells, was observed at unexpectedly high levels in S. sanguinis, Ralstonia spp., C. metallidurans, Methylobacterium, and S. epidermidis. The increased EthD-2 signal in these cells may reflect eDNA in the biofilms, as has been previously shown with similar species47,83–85. We plan to conduct future studies to identify the mechanisms involved in these bacterial interactions and biofilm formation. Our longitudinal study provides a comprehensive phenotypic investigation of ISS potable water microbial isolates, focusing on functional characteristics of the different species alone or as multispecies consortia. As joint molecular and phenotypic analyses can provide a more comprehensive understanding of polymicrobial interactions and function than either approach alone, we are currently investigating molecular mechanisms that may explain some of the functional phenotypes that were observed for several of the ISS isolates in this study. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth.Methods Strains and culture conditions Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Lists of ISS potable water isolates archived by NASA from the US water system between 2009 and 2015 were obtained online44. Diversity assessments using these publicly available data were performed as described in the text. Potable water isolates used in this study from early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years were provided by NASA JSC on commercial R2A media. Strains were cultured at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber for 1–10 days on the following solid media: TSA (MP biomedicals, 091010717; Difco 214530), R2A agar (Becton, Dickinson, 218263), or mR2A agar (modified R2A agar; Teknova, R0005; Difco 214530). Prior to each experiment (for all strains), single colonies were isolated on R2A agar (1.5% agar) or mR2A agar (1.3% agar) from frozen stocks, and individual strains were cultured in R2A broth (Teknova, R0005) at room temperature to stationary phase of growth. The growth kinetics of each strain were determined at the beginning of the study to confirm that experiments were all performed at the same phase of growth.Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Strains were individually cultured to stationary phase in R2A broth, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. We chose to test a range of antibiotic concentrations in our study based on literature searches, which included (a) concentrations commonly used for the same or similar organisms, including minimum inhibitory concentrations, and (b) reports that spaceflight can profoundly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of some bacteria86,87. Diluted and undiluted samples were plated on mR2A plates containing antibiotic(s) or NaCl at specified concentrations and incubated at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber. The AST plates were monitored for approximately one week and bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. Tenfold dilutions of a pure culture were plated on R2A agar media containing specific concentrations of antimicrobial compounds. Antimicrobial susceptibility was scored by testing the log decrease in bacterial survival, from 0 (no to <1 log-fold decrease) to 7 (7 or more log-fold decrease) (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines (Supplementary Fig. 5b)45.Energy-metabolism tests The casein-PR agar media used for metabolism testing contained 1% Casein (Sigma-Aldrich, 22090), 0.5% NaCl (S3014), 0.15% Bacto Yeast extract (BD, 212750), 0.008% Phenol red (PR, Sigma-Aldrich, P4758), and 1.3% agar. For additional supplements, 1% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903) or 1% lactose (Sigma, 61345) was added to the casein-PR media. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies.Biofilm tests mR2A plates containing Congo red (Sigma–Aldrich, C6767) 100 µg/ml, or crystal violet 100 µg/ml, were prepared. Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies. For air–liquid-surface biofilms, individual strains were inoculated in 5 mL of R2A broth, standing and development of biofilms were monitored for eight weeks. Photos were taken at eight weeks post inoculation.Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sample preparations Biofilms were developed on sterile glass cover slips in broth cultures of each individual strain for 24 h at RT. Cover slips containing pure culture biofilms were subsequently washed with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 mins, following gentle washing with cold DPBS twice. In a limited-light environment, the samples were stained with SYTO-9 green fluorescent stain (10 mg/mL, nucleic acid stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific S34854) for 15 min, Concanavalin A conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (500 mg/L, α-polysaccharide stain), Ethidium Homodimer-2 (EthD2, 1 mg/mL, dead-cell stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific E3599), or Fluorescent Brightener 28/Calcofluor White (0.7 mg/mL, β-polysaccharide stain, Sigma F3543) for five minutes. Biofilms were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 LSCM with sequential scanning. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. Three to six stacks of horizontal plane images (1024 × 1024 pixels) with a z-step of 3 μm (the distance between the images) were acquired for each sample from two or more randomly chosen areas. Two independent experiments were performed. Fluorescence images were acquired with excitation at 405 nm (1.57%), 488 nm (4.98%), 514 nm (10.1%), or 633 nm (3.1%); emission filter DAPI (420–460 nm), FITC (498–545 nm), mCherry (565–610 nm), or Alexa-644 (648–700 nm) and gain 540.2 V (PMT), 60% (HyD), 65% (HyD), or 60% (HyD). Image scanning was carried out by sequential scanning with seq-1 (405-nm laser, pinhole 0.31), seq-2 (488 nm and 633 nm, pinhole 0.32), and seq-3 (514 nm, pinhole 0.31).Hemolysis test Experiments were performed using the same methods for the AST studies, but instead used blood agar (BA; TSA with sheep blood, Fisher R01200). The plates were incubated and monitored for 15–72 h.Interspecies and mixed-species interaction testing Individual strains were grown in R2A broth as described above. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh R2A broth to concentrate by 10 times. To assess interactions between designated strains, 10-µl samples of each isolate were dropped onto R2A agar (1.5%) at the same time at a distance close enough to allow for interaction but far enough away to avoid fusion of the droplets. Pairwise combinations of every strain in this study were examined. For mixed-species assays, samples were prepared in the same way to test the interaction between two strains. Equal volumes of the 10X- concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop-applied on R2A agar (1.5%). Different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species. Incubation, monitoring, and recording were conducted as described above.Data collection, data analysis, and statistical analysis For most assays (except hemolysis and CLSM), microbial growth on plates was monitored over seven days by taking photos and recording observations every 1–2 days, mostly due to the varying growth speeds for different strains. All assays presented in this paper were repeated at least in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 or Microsoft Excel. Mean value and error bars (standard error of the mean) are indicated.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (5.3MB, pdf) Supplementary Data 1 (24.1KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (434.2KB, pdf) Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Alfred P.

Copyright notice ID: 5552977 PMID: 28798168 ABSTRACT The draft genome sequences of six Bacillus strains, isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group, are presented here. These strains were isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment Zvezda Module (two strains).GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Among the six Bacillus cereus sensu lato strains reported here, three U.S. Harmony Node 2 isolates (ISSFR-3F, ISSFR-9F, and ISSFT-23F) and one Japanese Experiment Module isolate (JEM-2) were sequenced and assembled with both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII sequence data. The remaining assemblies, including two Russian isolates, were sequenced and assembled with only MiSeq data. The MiSeq runs yielded on average 24 to 54 million 300-bp reads (from 1,402× to 3,093× average coverage), while PacBio yielded 4,000 to 116,000 reads (from 7× to 202× average coverage) (Table 1). Due to the extremely high coverage (>1,000×), Illumina MiSeq reads were randomly down-sampled to 100× using an estimated genome size of 5.3 Mb, resulting in an average of 1.2 to 1.5 million paired-end reads per isolate. Next, the down-sampled reads were assembled using iMetAMOS (1) with IDBA_UD and SPAdes (2). IDBA_UD was selected as the best assembly for all six isolates. Low confidence bases within the selected IDBA_UD (3) assemblies were masked out by mapping all reads to the assembled contigs and detecting conflicting variants with FreeBayes (4). The PacBio reads were assembled following the methods described by Berlin et al. (5) with Celera Assembler version 8.3rc1 and polished with Quiver (6). A second round of polishing was performed post-Quiver using the available MiSeq data as input to Pilon (7). TABLE 1 .

The six International Space Station (ISS) isolates were aligned (NUCmer [8], Parsnp [9]) against members of the B. cereus sensu lato group genomes (10). The PacBio assemblies were used for all isolates with sufficient read coverage, and Illumina assemblies were used for the remaining isolates. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 to 5.3 Mb), NUCmer pairwise alignments (>99.9% average pairwise nucleotide identity) and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic placement, all six isolates were found to exhibit a very high degree of similarity. Finally, due to their high genomic similarity to the B. anthracis type strain (>98% average nucleotide identity), all six genomes were examined for evidence of pathogenicity. However, none of the commonly known B. anthracis signature elements were identified. Specifically, all six ISS isolates (i) contain the plcR (11) ancestral “C” allele, which has been used in large-scale phylogenetic analyses to distinguish B. anthracis strains from the rest of the B. cereus group; (ii) lack significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids; and (iii) are phylogenetically placed outside of the B. anthracis clade. Results were consistent with a comparative genomic analysis performed using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Microbial Threat Characterization Pipeline. Altogether, the collective genomic evidence supports the conclusion that the six ISS isolates represent a novel Bacillus sp. located within the B. cereus sensu lato group. Accession number(s).

Copyright notice ID: 5805884 PMID: 29439046 ABSTRACT We report here the draft genome sequences of four strains isolated from spacecraft-associated surfaces exhibiting increased resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and exposure to H2O2. The draft genomes of strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA had sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respectively.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Bacillus horneckiae strain 1P01SCT was isolated from a spacecraft assembly clean room at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where the Phoenix spacecraft was assembled (1). As previously reported, spores of this strain were resistant to UV254 radiation up to 1,000 J m−2. Bacillus nealsonii FO-92T was isolated from fall-out particles collected from a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2). Spores of FO-92T have exhibited resistances to UV254 up to 300 J m−2, and vegetative cells and spores of this organism were resistant in up to 5% liquid H2O2 (2). Acinetobacter radioresistens 50v1 was isolated from the surface of the Mars Odyssey orbiter (3). Vegetative cells of this organism were capable of surviving a combination of stressors, including desiccation, up to 1,000 J of UV254 radiation, and up to 0.33 mg/ml of H2O2 (3). Acinetobacter proteolyticus strain 2P01AA was isolated from the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at KSC during the assembly of the Phoenix spacecraft (4). As reported previously, strain 2P01AA exhibited increased resistance to H2O2 exposure and survival in up to 320 mM H2O2 (5). Here, we report the first draft genome sequences of B. horneckiae type strain 1P01SC, B. nealsonii type strain FO-92, and two Acinetobacter species strains, 50v1, and 2P01AA, isolated from spacecraft hardware and associated surfaces. Strains 1P01SCT, FO-92T, 50v1, and 2P01AA, were sequenced using a shotgun sequencing approach on the Illumina HiSeq paired-end platform. The reads were de novo assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.1.1, resulting in total genome sizes of 5,500,894 bp, 4,699,376 bp, 3,174,402 bp, and 4,328,804 bp, respectively.

Both strains had MutS, RecA, MutL, excinuclease ABC, beta-lactamase, and genes coding for the formation of persister cells (10). Strain FO-92T had a prophage-associated DNA repair protein (RecT), six genes associated with spore DNA protection, exodeoxyribonuclease III, and a peroxide stress regulator (PerR). Strain 1P01SCT had cold shock proteins (CspD and CspA) and a heat-inducible transcriptional repressor (HrcA). Acinetobacter strains 50v1 and 2P01AA possessed putative genes coding for persister cell formation, heat shock and cold shock responses, superoxide dismutase, rubredoxin-NAD(+) reductase, and cobalt, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic resistance (11). Strain 2P01AA had putative genes coding for heme oxygenase (HemO) and four genes coding for quorum-sensing molecules, which initiate biofilm biosynthesis and adhesion (12). Strain 50v1 had genes associated with betaine and choline uptake, which further allow for increased water retention in the cells (13), as well as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C and a DNA-binding protein (Dps), which has been shown to protect organisms from oxidative stress (14).

KEYWORDS: 16S rRNA amplicon, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Vibrio, abalone, built environment, low biomass, metagenomics, microbial ecology, neonatal intensive care unit, NICUABSTRACT Microbiome analyses of low-biomass samples are challenging because of contamination and inefficiencies, leading many investigators to employ low-throughput methods with minimal controls. We developed a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms single-tube extractions while processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n = 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192, 123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq protocol. IMPORTANCE Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process.

We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.INTRODUCTION Many emerging applications of the microbiome, ranging from forensics (1) to medicine to optimization of the cleanliness of facilities where sensitive components are assembled (2, 3), require analysis of low-biomass samples. These applications are moving rapidly away from microbial load measurement and toward the characterization of microbial community composition. Recent studies of the built environment have identified key factors driving the microbiome on surfaces and in air, including the transfer of microbes from humans to environmental surfaces (4), due to the fact that humans can shed 10 million bacteria/h in indoor settings (5). Other key factors modifying the indoor microbiome include temperature, humidity, airflow rates (6), ventilation type (4), and patients or health care workers (7). However, built environments low in microbial biomass remain difficult to study because of poor DNA extraction and amplification efficiency. Spacecraft assembly facilities (SAFs) are extremely low-microbial-biomass environments, even compared to other built or low-biomass environments such as hospitals (6), pharmaceutical production facilities (8), and indoor environments (3), because the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) takes extreme steps to avoid the transfer of any terrestrial contaminants to other planets (9). More than 15 years of microbiological surveys of various NASA and European Space Agency cleanroom facilities showed that 1 to 10 m2 needs to be sampled to obtain reproducible microbiome signatures by Sanger sequencing, PhyloChip, 454 pyrosequencing, or Illumina sequencing (2). These procedures are critical because NASA allows only swabs, not larger sampling devices, for the collection of materials from sensitive spacecraft hardware surfaces (e.g., components of a sampling or life detection system, typically with surface areas of <1 m2). However, many other low-microbial-biomass environments are of considerable interest, including neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (10, 11) and aquaculture (12) settings, motivating the development of a general technique that works across these environments. We developed a new protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos, meaning clean or pure), that combines high sensitivity and low contamination to study the nature and distribution of the few microbes that survive in low-microbial-biomass settings. Because many popular DNA extraction and amplification kits are contaminated with trace levels of microbial DNA, we reasoned that spiked positive controls would be essential in determining whether amplicon products from low-biomass samples are true reflections of the environment (13, 14). Many investigators have also expressed concern that high-throughput methods introduce well-to-well contamination or reduced efficiency, and thus, laborious and time-consuming single-tube extractions must be performed. KatharoSeq consists of a commercial off-the-shelf high-throughput DNA extraction protocol, combined with carefully arranged titrations of positive and negative controls at the DNA extraction and library construction phase to assess cell counts and well-to-well contamination, together with an integrated bioinformatics pipeline for calculating and applying sample exclusion that is compatible with either amplicon sequencing or shotgun metagenomics. To demonstrate KatharoSeq’s utility, we applied it to three disparate built environments with low microbial biomass. These samples consisted of 100 25-cm2 floor samples and 92 controls from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) SAF, 335 locations (primarily 25 cm2) across all 52 rooms of the NICU with 53 controls, and 159 sampling points (primarily 25 cm2) within an endangered-abalone-rearing facility with 33 controls.RESULTS Choosing a DNA extraction technique for KatharoSeq. We benchmarked several different high-throughput commercial DNA extraction and bead cleanup techniques and compared them to single-tube extractions by processing negative and positive controls. For positive controls, a single bacterial isolate, Bacillus subtilis, was grown and then sorted with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) so that a titration of cells (n = 5, 50, 500, or 5,000) could be processed and compared across techniques (Fig. 1a). The Mo Bio PowerMag with a ClearMag bead cleanup step consistently performed best, as it had the lowest limit of detection and thus was chosen for KatharoSeq (Fig. 1b). With a 50-cell input, we could differentiate the positive control, B. subtilis, from the negative controls, although only 28.8% of the sequences aligned with the target. With a 500-cell input, 90.6% of the reads were mapped to Bacillus with all 18 replicates generating sufficient sequences for analysis, thus placing a conservative limit of detection at 500 cells (Fig. 1b). On the basis of these titrations from the Mo Bio PowerMag-with-ClearMag protocol, we determined the total background noise of the entire pipeline (Fig. 2) to be approximately 96.88 cells per sample (K1/2) from an allosteric sigmoidal distribution, R2 = 0.9209 (Fig. 1c). Thus, if a given sample has an initial starting quantity of 96.9 cells, approximately 50% of the reads will be the primary sample while the other 50% will be contaminant. Of the low-throughput methods, the Qiagen Ultraclean Pathogen kit performed best (Fig. 1b). FIG 1 . Open in a new tab Low-biomass microbiome kit evaluation. (a) Experimental design of low-biomass kit evaluating negative and positive controls (5, 50, 500, and 5,000 bacterial cells) across three solid-phase and two magnetic-bead-based DNA extraction methods. LT, low throughput; HT, high throughput. (b) Libraries of 16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced, and the limit of detection of B. subtilis from DNA extraction was determined by comparing the composition of the expected target in known inputs of cells with that in negative controls by a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 0.05). (c) The limit of detection of the assay and approximate background noise were determined by calculating the K1/2 value by using the allosteric sigmoidal equation on the Bacillus composition. (d) The median read counts (interquartile range) were compared against blanks by using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 0.05) to distinguish signal from noise. (e) Read counts were plotted against the expected composition of the target and fitted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation to describe the number of reads where 50% of the read composition was the expected target. This was performed for DNA extraction positive controls from the Mo Bio PowerMag kit, which performed the best, with a limit of detection of 50 cells.FIG 2 . Open in a new tab Description of the low-biomass microbiome bench protocol and computational analysis. KatharoSeq-specific recommendations are highlighted throughout the pipeline from sample collection to bioinformatic sample exclusion.Deriving sample exclusion criteria. Since one of the challenges in low-biomass microbiome analyses is determining how to exclude samples, we also evaluated the read counts across controls from this comparison. The number of reads produced per sample was also highly correlated with the number of input cells (Fig. 1d) and can thus be used as a guide for sample exclusion. When comparing the read counts of positive and negative controls, the Mo Bio PowerMag-with-ClearMag protocol was able to distinguish down to 500 cells, which was the lowest number among the kits tested (Fig. 1d). Upon applying the allosteric sigmoidal equation to the Mo Bio PowerMag-ClearMag samples, we determine that at K1/2, when 50% of the reads from the positive control mapped to the target organism, the read count was 683 (Fig. 1e). Thus, in the low-biomass experiment, one could exclude samples with <683 reads. All 24 DNA extraction negative controls had <683 reads, while only 1 sample from the 5-cell input and 2 samples from the 50-cell input generated at least 683 reads. Of the 500-cell inputs, 16 of the 18 samples had at least 683 reads and thus would be included in the analysis, while all 18 samples from the 5,000-cell input produced sufficient reads for inclusion. Thus, by using read counts from positive controls paired with the composition of those positive controls, one can determine a per-study limit of detection. Additional methods attempted to improve the extraction efficiency or quality control (QC) were futile. More specifically, it is common in molecular biology to add carrier RNA during DNA extraction to improve the extraction efficiency or yield, particularly with columns. In this experiment, adding carrier RNA did not affect recovery and detection by the high-throughput methods and only partially increased detection by the low-throughput method (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Gel electrophoresis is a low-cost quality assurance/QC method typically used to test whether enough library product was produced by a PCR or library construction for next-generation sequencing, but the effectiveness of this approach has, to our knowledge, not been assessed for modern library construction protocols and specifically for low-biomass samples. Amplicon libraries from only 26 of the 72 DNA extraction positive controls (5-, 50-, 500-, and 5,000-cell inputs) generated a visible band in a 2% agarose gel, while 37 libraries were shown to have enough reads to be included in the analysis by the KatharoSeq exclusion method (Fig. S2b). This demonstrates that library success based on the presence of a band in a gel has a 30% false-negativity rate and thus should be absolutely avoided for low-biomass applications. Of the 37 successful libraries, 1 was from a 5-cell input, 2 were from 50-cell inputs, 16 were from 500-cell inputs, and 18 out of 18 were from 5,000-cell inputs. None of the DNA extraction negative controls showed a band in the gel, and each of these negative controls generated fewer than 683 reads. From these results, we deem it unwise to utilize gels to QC low-biomass libraries and instead insist on the use of read counts from positive and negative controls.

We applied this method of exclusion to samples from the three unique cleanrooms. For the subsequent built-environment analyses, we conservatively designated our sample exclusion to be the median read count of the 5,000-cell input. This was determined on the basis of positive controls for each built environment (SAF, 1,696 reads; NICU and abalone-rearing facility, 2,015 reads). Values will vary from experiment to experiment primarily because of differences in overall sequencing depth and, marginally, well-to-well contamination occurring during sample collection or processing and thus should be calculated for each experiment and sequencing run.Applying KatharoSeq to low-biomass environments. We applied KatharoSeq amplicon sequencing to three unique low-biomass environments: the JPL SAF, an NICU, and a facility for rearing critically endangered abalone. Together with positive controls from the initial low-biomass method development, a total of 1,072 samples generated 25,969,842 reads representing 16,417 suboperational taxonomic units (sOTUs). We also processed, 556 samples from the three environments for shotgun metagenomics (96 from the SAF, 337 from the NICU, and 123 from the abalone-rearing facility). The success rate of samples processed through the 16S rRNA amplicon pipeline (SAF, 57%; NICU, 50%; abalone-rearing facility, 90%) was generally higher than the success rate of the shotgun metagenome analysis (SAF, 64%; NICU, 44%; abalone-rearing facility, 35%). Results from the SAF cleanroom-specific microbiome highlighted the importance of using controls. For 16S rRNA analysis, the minimum exclusion of 1,696 reads was determined by calculating the median read counts of the positive DNA extraction controls at 5,000 cells (Fig. 1a and b). Forty-three samples yielded <1,696 reads and were omitted from the analysis (Fig. 1b). KatharoSeq revealed a SAF cleanroom-specific microbiome with a distinct and interpretable spatial pattern (Fig. 3). Beta diversity analysis revealed that a subset of seven samples clustered in a way that did not match the overall pattern (Fig. 3c), indicating a different microbial composition related to human exposure. When cross-referencing to the facility floor (Fig. 3f, red asterisks), these primarily low-traffic and normal-traffic samples localized to the top right corner and top middle of the facility, a nonrandom pattern distinguishing them from reagent contaminants or sequencing failures. FIG 3 . Open in a new tab Optimized KatharoSeq protocol applied to a JPL cleanroom facility. (a) The number of deblurred reads represented by the DNA extraction and PCR positive controls is plotted against the composition of the target organism. The distribution is fitted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation that describes the number of reads when 50% of the composition is recorded (K1/2).

(e) Associations of human foot traffic with sample composition of the top four most abundant sOTUs. (f) The most abundant sOTU in the samples, A. lwoffii, is mapped onto the JPL facility 2D map, with the samples deviating from the cluster noted with a red asterisk.Four sOTUs were identified by 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis as frequent members of the JPL SAF microbiome, present in at least 75% of the JPL floor samples. These were Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., Novosphingobium, and Acinetobacter lwoffii. Sphingomonas sp. was also present in 70% of the JPL floor samples. This organism was identified as a common SAF core sOTU in the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Johnson Space Center, and JPL (15), increasing confidence in its prevalence in this type of environment. Thirty-two sOTUs were differentially abundant in the global SAF floor samples, compared to the one sOTU associated with the PCR positive controls (Fig. 3d). Of these 32 SAF-associated sOTUs, 4 were positively associated with high human exposure, as determined by differential abundance, and included A. lwoffii, Enterobacteriaceae, Caulobacteraceae, and Novosphingobium sp. (Fig. 3e). The A. lwoffii sOTU was present in the negative JPL and positive PCR controls, but the levels were orders of magnitude lower than the real signal, indicating that this result stems from a minimal amount of well-to-well contamination (Fig. 3d). The composition of A. lwoffii, when mapped onto the two-dimensional (2D) layout of the JPL SAF, is in lower relative abundance in the top right corner and top middle. This spatial pattern strikingly resembles the overall spatial relationship in the community level beta diversity analysis (Fig. 3c). Shotgun metagenomic analysis of very-low-biomass samples is very challenging, and most of the research on such samples to date has used amplicon-based techniques or whole-genome amplified products (13). Our floor samples had very low DNA yields, with a mean double-stranded DNA yield of 59.4 (standard error, 9.1) pg/µl, and 23% of the samples had DNA concentrations below the detection limit of 1 pg/µl. We performed metagenomic sequencing of 96 of the 192 samples, including 50 representative JPL SAF floor samples (based on the amplicon analysis) and 46 controls, without the use of whole-genome amplification. Analysis of the spiked controls provided confidence in the assemblies of other microbes from the samples for both 16S rRNA gene analysis and shotgun metagenomics. As expected, for the Vibrio fischeri genomic DNA (gDNA)-spiked controls, there were positive correlations among the starting genome quantity, the number of resulting sequences, and the number of assembled contigs. More than 98% of the full V. fischeri genome was recovered in the assembly at a spike-in level of 5,000 copies, and ~30% was recovered from just 50 copies (Fig. S4). The 50 JPL SAF floor samples yielded highly variable numbers of sequences (mean, 3.18 × 105; standard deviation, 4.63 × 106). One air swab control, FC3, yielded 1.76 × 105 sequences, while the other three air swab controls and all three water controls yielded <1,500 sequences. Consequently, the control swabs differed significantly in yield. Human sequences were identified and removed from the data set with Bowtie 2.2.9 (see Materials and Methods). Of the 50 JPL floor samples, 29 (58%) contained <1% human sequences, while 17 (34%) contained 1 to 10% human sequences. Taxonomic profiling results of samples with at least 10,000 processed sequences revealed high abundances of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter equi, and Acinetobacter johnsonii in JPL SAF floor samples, while A. lwoffii was not detected by this method because there were no high-quality assembled genomes in the database.Comparing the SAF environment to two other low-biomass environments. A detailed description and interpretation of all three facilities are beyond the scope of this report, but we provide a brief comparison of the SAF data with the NICU and abalone-rearing facility data to demonstrate the utility of KatharoSeq in characterizing a range of low-biomass environments and relating them to one another (Fig. 4). FIG 4 . Open in a new tab Microbial diversity was broadly compared across three unique built-environment study sites for 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. (a) Microbial richness of 16S rRNA amplicon data was calculated for various sample types within the built environment and organized by human exposure (H, high human exposure; M, medium human exposure; L, low human exposure). LBM, low biomass, indicates the kit testing controls from the Mobio Powermag kit. Beta diversity PCoA plots of weighted UniFrac distances of 16S rRNA amplicon (c) and Bray-Curtis distances of shotgun metagenomic samples (d) demonstrate study-specific microbial communities. The floor samples within the three built environments are solid spheres in the 16S rRNA amplicon plot (c), while other samples are transparent. (d) Heatmap depicting the top 464 of the 16,417 most abundant sOTUs across the 438 samples that passed QC. Floor samples are indicated by a line to demonstrate the similarity and differences of microbes on the floors of the three built environments.Across the three built environments, the alpha diversity measured by microbial taxon richness was highest in the abalone-rearing facility, followed by the NICU and then the SAF (Fig. 4a) (Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, 131.8; P < 0.0001). Within each of the three environments, human exposure was associated with microbial taxon richness, although some of the details differed among the environments. Floor samples, most exposed to direct contact with humans, consistently had the highest diversity (Fig. 4b). In the NICU, the microbial taxon richness of keyboard, chair, and floor samples was positively associated with the human exposure of each surface. However, contrary to this general trend, the stethoscope and incubator samples had higher microbial taxon richness in low-exposure rooms. The reason for this apparent paradox is that stethoscopes and incubators are sanitized each day in occupied rooms, reducing their microbial diversity on a daily basis (Fig. 4b). At the abalone-rearing facility, the microbial taxon richness of the abalone tank wall and floor samples was negatively associated with human exposure, contrary to the general trend. However, this effect might be due to characteristics of the influence of the individual abalone species on their surrounding microbial environments, because the abalone species are physically separated from one another (Fig. 4b). The white abalone tanks were considered to have lower human exposure, because they are physically separated from the other tanks. The total microbial taxon richness was greatest on the surface of abalone shells, followed by the foot and then the feces, which could have implications for understanding exposures of abalone to environmental microbes (Fig. 4b). As expected and as a validation of the technique, the microbial community composition differed in each low-biomass environment, as measured by 16S rRNA analysis (Fig. 4c) and shotgun metagenome sequencing (Fig. 4d). The beta diversity distance of floor samples (solid-color spheres) from the other samples (transparent) within each built environment (by color) was smaller than the distances of floor samples from other built environments (Fig. 4c). The NICU environment, as a whole, had greater microbial richness than the JPL SAF but less than the abalone-rearing facility. Microbial richness was highest on the floor, lowest on stethoscopes and incubators, and intermediate on chairs, keyboards, and other surfaces (Fig. 4b). Relative to the floor, the incubator was enriched in Klebsiella and the stethoscope was enriched in Staphylococcus (Fig. S4) and Neisseriaceae. No sOTUs were associated with acuity level or neonate occupancy when incubator, stethoscope, and floor samples were compared. Pathogen outbreaks in hospitals are of grave concern, especially when they occur in sensitive populations such as the ICU or NICU. We were able to observe from the metagenomic data strains that were relevant to clinical increases in infection and colonization in the NICU. In the months after the study, two cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) invasive disease (bacteremia) were identified as an increase over baseline number of noninvasive clinical isolates of MRSA (institutional review board [IRB] number 171209X). The high-acuity F pod had six MRSA-positive cultures in 5 of the 14 rooms, while the low-acuity GH pod had only six MRSA-positive cultures across 5 of the 37 rooms (42.9% versus 23.7% incidence). In accordance with these clinical observations, we found that samples from the F pod had larger proportions of Staphylococcus than those from the GH pods. Since the F pod is higher acuity, it has a higher density of health care professionals, potentially contributing a higher input of Staphylococcus, and its rooms receive more frequent cleaning, which may maintain a harsh environment that unintentionally enriches drug-resistant bacteria. Whole-metagenome sequencing revealed that most of the staphylococcal signals were Staphylococcus epidermidis, although S. aureus was also present. To prevent disease outbreaks and minimize patient-to-patient microbial transfer, this NICU was designed to have individual patient rooms. An outstanding question, however, is when a patient is infected, what the effect on nearby patients is. Furthermore, when a patient has an infection, does this also colonize the room itself or is it confined to the person? We observed a second strain linked to a clinical event. In the detailed survey, Serratia marcescens, a human pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU (16), was highly abundant on various surfaces in room 813, including the incubator, along with various surfaces in room 811 (Fig. S3). Upon chart review, the patient in 813 developed an S. marcescens lung infection, which was confirmed by respiratory and eye cultures on 12 and 13 January, respectively. The patient continued to have positive cultures on 13 and 23 February 2017 after multiple administrations of antibiotics. Finding S. marcescens in this room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture, while not observing the organism in two adjacent rooms, indicates the potential utility of noninvasive built-environment sampling for monitoring and discovering infectious agents in a clinical setting.

The microbial composition of the abalone-rearing facility was distinct from that of the SAF and the NICU. The abalone-rearing facility uses a flowthrough system to supply seawater to the main aquarium, while the white abalone tanks receive UV-treated and filtered seawater. Abalone hosts generally had species-specific microbiomes from the feces, the foot, and the shell (Fig. S4). When comparing microbial communities by presence or absence by using unweighted UniFrac distances, the red and white abalone body sites clustered more closely with built-environment samples taken from the respective red and white abalone tanks (Fig. S4a). Further, the pink, green, and white abalone fecal communities were more closely related than red abalone fecal communities. However, some replicates from the white abalone foot and shell mirrored that of the environment, suggesting a more transient community (Fig. S4a and b). The most abundant sOTU in the abalone aquarium microbiome was a Vibrio sp. (Fig. S4c). Spatially, this Vibrio sOTU was present across the entire facility and highly abundant in the fecal material from all of the abalone species sampled (Fig. S4c). Shotgun metagenome analysis revealed several potential Vibrio spp. present across the communities, with Vibrio breoganii followed by Vibrio tasmaniensis making up the majority (Fig. S4d). The other most common microbes in the facility were Psychrilyobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Colwelliaceae, and Leucothrix, providing a microbiome markedly different from that of the other two environments sampled (Fig. 4d). The pathogen responsible for causing withering syndrome (12) was not detected in the facility or associated with the abalone hosts.

DISCUSSION The KatharoSeq protocol integrates positive and negative controls, specific choices of high-throughput DNA extraction and bead cleanup kits, library construction and pooling strategies for amplicon sequencing or shotgun metagenomics, and bioinformatic sample exclusion protocols to achieve a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific method of probing low-biomass microbiomes. By utilizing high-throughput extraction methods, one can perform 384 DNA extractions with a single EpMotion robot paired with four KingFisher robots in 6 h, compared to processing around 72 samples per 6 h by low-throughput methods. We emphasize that positive controls both before and after DNA extraction are required, using spike-ins of different organisms so that different contamination sources can be detected and controlled. Specifically, we recommend having at least 24 total positive and 12 negative DNA extraction controls per project with at least 8 and 4 per 96-well plate. Positive controls processed before DNA extraction assess DNA extraction efficiency, provide detection limits in terms of the minimum number of cells, and reveal DNA extraction kit or sample processing contaminants. For each sequencing run, we also recommend having at least 24 to 48 PCR positive controls (12 to 24 single strain and 12 to 24 mock community) along with 8 PCR negative controls. The PCR positive controls should be a serial dilution of gDNA down to subgenome copies. Positive controls spiked before PCR amplification reveal detection limits at the PCR step, help quantify contaminants in PCR master mix reagents, and allow estimation of input DNA concentrations (Fig. 1). We were able to easily differentiate samples from the three environments tested, and in all three cases, the shotgun metagenomic results provided a second line of evidence obtained from amplicon sequencing. For the first study, we describe the biogeography of a SAF used to construct equipment such as the Mars rovers, which has ultralow-microbial-biomass requirements. In the JPL SAF, we were able to confirm that a very plausible microbe that frequently contaminates other cleanrooms was present in this facility. A. lwoffii was the most common microbe found in the JPL SAF, consistent with the previous report that Acinetobacter was described at low levels (<5%) in the JPL SAF and at higher levels (2 to 33%) at KSC (15). Acinetobacter is a frequent cleanroom contaminant because it resists sterilization procedures and disinfectants and is also frequently reported as an aerosolized infectious agent in hospitals (17). In the shotgun metagenomic analysis, A. lwoffii did not show up in the k-mer profile because the genome of A. lwoffii was not in the default Kraken database, but alignments directly with the reference genome confirmed its presence. On the basis of the metagenomic approach, we also detected multiple fungal and viral groups, which is beyond the scope of standard 16S rRNA amplicon protocols. Only the careful selection of positive controls in the KatharoSeq protocol allows confidence in the identification of cleanroom microbes while controlling for kit and sample processing contaminants. By realizing the species level resolution and comparison across spatially diverse samples, we can begin to understand the origin and sources of strains in a cleanroom or hospital setting and engineer systems that eliminate these organisms. The largest hospital microbiome study to date (7) suggests that the microbial communities of patient rooms are most influenced by the original microbes of the patients themselves. Because the neonates in the NICU do not yet have established microbiomes, we suspect that the skin-associated microbes found in the NICU are instead from health care professionals or parents. Supporting this observation, no sOTUs were associated with acuity level or neonate occupancy. Currently, methods for pathogen monitoring are restricted to patient samples that are sent for culturing only. Being able to monitor and predict pathogen occurrences by routine culture-independent noninvasive sampling of the built environment could be a useful approach for preventing outbreaks by identifying compromised or infected patients or potential hot spots of transmission. Future work should aim to establish baseline MRSA skin or nasal colonization rates of neonates and relate to infection rates. Standardized procedures need to be developed to eliminate sampling biases for sampling microbiomes paired with clinical culturing. Finding S. marcescens, a human pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU (16), in a specific NICU room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture but not in two adjacent rooms indicates the utility of KatharoSeq for biosurveillance monitoring. Similarly, aquaculture facilities often employ costly engineering controls to minimize intraunit pathogen transfer from humans, but our results suggest that most microbes in a cleanroom aquarium likely originate from the water or marine animals rather than humans. Each Vibrio species we observed has only been recently discovered. V. breoganii is a mollusk-associated, nonmotile, alginolytic marine bacterium within the Vibrio halioticoli clade (18, 19), and V. tasmaniensis was isolated from fish (19). Several Vibrio species have been identified as molluscan pathogens (18), and further studies should therefore be conducted to elucidate the symbiotic or pathogenic role of these species within abalone. By establishing that abalone have species-specific microbial communities with a large core of taxa shared with their environment, future studies should be aimed at understanding how perturbing the built environment can influence host microbiomes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the KatharoSeq protocol provides compelling microbial community analyses down to limits of detection of 50 to 500 cells in a high-throughput setting. It enables low-biomass investigations in a wide range of areas. The total processing time from when biological samples are received to when sequencing data are obtained is approximately 48 h (20). The pipeline can be easily scaled to increase throughput, because multiple steps, including plate loading, DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing, can be automated by using robotic liquid handlers. In particular, high-throughput analysis of epidemiological cohorts of banked plasma samples and household dust samples improved the detection and control of microbial contamination in semiconductor and spacecraft fabrication settings, including planetary protection applications, and forensic analysis of degraded or minuscule samples will greatly benefit from the utilization of this high-throughput, scalable protocol.MATERIALS AND METHODS Kit comparisons. An isolate of B. subtilis 3610 cultivated at 37°C overnight was sorted by flow cytometry on a Sony SH800Z FACS by using SYBR green fluorescence, isolating 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cells in a sterile 0.22-µm-filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. DNA extractions from each set of sorted cells were performed in triplicate with and without carrier RNA (Thermo, Fisher catalog no. 4382878) with manual single-tube DNA extraction kits (Mo Bio PowerSoil, where the consumables were autoclaved for 3 h [21], and the Qiagen Ultra Clean kit) (Fig. 1a). A 1-µg sample of carrier RNA was added to samples after lysis. Negative controls of the PBS with and without carrier RNA along with complete blanks were DNA extracted in triplicate alongside the positive controls as well. These single-tube manual protocols were compared to the high-throughput DNA isolation protocols adopted from the Earth Microbiome Project by using the same cultures of B. subtilis (n = 9) with and without carrier RNA along with negative controls of PBS (n = 12) and blanks (n = 12) with the EpMotion 5075 liquid-handling robot (for the initial lysis steps), followed by the KingFisher Flex robot (bead-based DNA extraction). Two different bead cleanup protocols, Swiftmag beads and ClearMag beads, were tested (Fig. 1a). All extracted DNA was amplified in triplicate for 35 PCR cycles with a 5-µl input in a 25-µl reaction mixture volume with the Earth Microbiome Project standard 16S V4 515f/806rB bar-coded primers (22, 23). These amplicons were pooled and run on 2% agarose gel and quantified with PicoGreen to access quality and relative quantity. Samples with no visible band were pooled at equal volumes of 20 µl; otherwise, samples were pooled at 50 ng per sample for a total sample volume of up to 20 µl. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 × 150 bp by using paired-end reads. Bioinformatic processing of samples was conducted in Qiita with QIIME v1.9.1 (24) with the first read trimmed to 150 bp and then processed with deblur (25), a de novo sOTU picking method. For phylogenetics-based distance comparisons of the microbiomes, a tree was constructed from the sOTUs with SEPP (SATé-Enabled Phylogenetic Placement; https://github.com/smirarab/sepp/blob/master/sepp/tree.py), and then results were visualized in EMPeror (26). Sample communities were then annotated with Greengenes. The per-sample read counts generated after demultiplexing were used to compare false-negativity rates for using a gel to qualify low-biomass libraries (Fig. S2). The reference hit biom table was generated with deblur (25). The counts of all sOTUs generated from the deblur biom table were summed to determine the number of reads per sample. To determine if read counts could be used as a proxy to measure starting biomass and thus estimate sample success for other samples, read counts from positive DNA extraction controls were compared against blanks by using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 (Fig. 1b). The proportion of sequences aligning with Bacillus was measured in each sample group and also compared in the same method (Fig. 1d). Samples from the top-performing kit were then selected to compare read counts against microbial composition and fitted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation that determines the read number at which 50% of the reads align with the correct target, Bacillus (Fig. 1c). This was repeated again for comparing input cell counts to composition to determine the absolute limit of detection of the process (Fig. 1e). On the basis of these results, we have outlined the steps needed to perform a low-biomass microbiome analysis that includes controls at each step of the processing paired with bioinformatic analysis for sample exclusion based on read counts (Fig. 2). We applied this method to the 16S rRNA amplicon data from the three unique built environments. Sample exclusion was conservatively calculated and applied for each data set by removing samples that had less than the median read count of 5,000-cell positive controls. The success rate of 16S rRNA amplicon analysis across the three built environments was determined by the proportion of samples with read counts greater than the median read counts of the 5,000-cell positive controls. This is a conservative estimate of success, as we were able to detect positive controls down to 50 cells and thus could use the median read counts at 50 cells. Since fewer positive controls were used for the shotgun metagenome analysis, we determined success by the proportion of primary samples with read counts great than the median read counts of the negative controls. Alpha diversity (microbial richness expressed as the number of observed sOTUs) and beta diversity (unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances [27]) were calculated with Qiime v1.9.1. Beta diversity and principal-component analysis (PCoA) plots for the shotgun metagenomes were calculated by using the Bray-Curtis distance matrix (28).JPL SAF sample collection and processing. Patches of surface in an ISO class 7 cleanroom at the JPL SAF in Pasadena, CA, were collected on 31 August 2016 with ultraclean water-moistened sterile swabs. Each patch was 25 cm2. Prior to sampling, technicians donned cleanroom garments and two sets of people were dispatched to collect samples from the JPL SAF where most of the Mars 2020 spacecraft components will be assembled. Each set of technicians consisted of two members, one of whom actively collected samples from JPL SAF surfaces while the other carefully cut the swab heads with a sterile scalpel after sample collection. One set of technicians collected samples from 50 surfaces, and a second set of technicians sampled another 50 JPL SAF surfaces. Immediately after samples were obtained, vials containing sample swabs were frozen at −80°C and sent to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) via frozen shipment. Negative controls consisted of dry swabs exposed to air in the facility for the duration of a typical sampling event, and the same molecular-grade water was used to wet the swabs.NICU sampling. Patches of surface (25 cm2) in the NICU of the recently built (5-month-old) Jacobs Medical Center were sampled with swabs on 1 March 2017 as described in the JPL SAF facility protocol. Broad sampling of the inside of the incubator, the stethoscope surface (15 cm2), and the floor near the bed was done throughout all 52 patient rooms in two wings of the hospital, for a total of 156 samples. Each wing of the hospital was of either high acuity (rooms 801 to 814) or low acuity (rooms 815 to 852), where the patient-to-nurse ratio varied from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1, respectively. In each of the two wings, four replicate locations within the primary nursing station were sampled, including the chair seat, table, keyboard, and floor, for a total of 16 samples per nursing station or 32 samples overall. An additional 21 samples were collected in seven of the rooms for a more detailed survey of the floor, surfaces, incubator, and parent chair microbial communities. The seven rooms included two in the low-acuity wing (837 and 838) and five in the high-acuity wing (801, 802, 806, 813, and 814). Rooms 801 and 802 were both considered negative-pressure rooms and are used for quarantine purposes. Within each wing, rooms were chosen to be approximately the same distance from the nursing station while varying in occupancy, as noted by the black silhouette of a baby in the image. Within the patient room, the six surfaces swabbed included an air vent, a nurse’s chair, a nurse’s keyboard, a feeding pump or heating device, a sink, and the opening of the diaper trash can. Six surfaces of the parent’s chair included the two arm locations, seat, back, top, and behind that would not be in contact with visitors. In addition to the incubator sample taken from the inside near the head position across all 52 rooms, an additional three samples were swabbed within the incubator at the hands and feet, along with one swab from the outside that would not be in contact with a neonate. The additional floor samples were taken from each corner of the room along with the first step inside the doorway. Statistical analyses of the 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome data were performed as described in Materials and Methods. The 388 samples were processed by the high-throughput methods and then 16S rRNA amplicon sequenced. Further, 337 samples processed through the high-throughput KatharoSeq protocol were processed for shotgun metagenome sequencing.Southwest Fisheries Science Center abalone research aquarium sampling. Abalone-rearing facility samples were taken on 14 and 24 February 2017 at a total of 159 sampling points, including 68 abalone-associated and 91 facility- or tank-associated samples (Fig. S4). Within the facility, seawater is filtered to remove larger (50- to 100-µm) particles, UV treated, and then ozonated to remove and destroy microbes from the water before deployment to animal tanks. Ten individual white abalone were weighed, measured for length, sexed, and then swabbed on the foot and shell, and four fecal detritus pellets were removed from the tank, for a total of 24 white abalone samples. Eight red abalone were swabbed on the foot and shell, and eight fecal pellets were collected from the bottom of the tank, for another 24 samples. Five green abalone fecal pellets were collected, and five fecal pellets were collected from three different pink abalone tanks. Each of the three pink abalone tanks represented animals that had undergone oxytetracycline antibiotic treatments at various times in the past (1 day, 90 days, or 3 years). Forty-one facility samples included 18 floor samples taken at two time points along with a door handle, two skimmer locations, and two table surfaces. Twenty-seven samples were taken from the white abalone tank, including five bottom, four turf liner, four wall, five PVC pipe, one air hose, four water, and four kelp food samples. Twenty-three samples were swabbed from the red abalone tank, including four tank lip (not touching water), two PVC pipe, four air stone, five water, four wall, and four kelp samples. All samples were processed through the KatharoSeq protocol, with equal volumes pooled and processed for 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. The work involving white abalone at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center was permitted under ESA permit no. 14344-2R issued to J. Hyde. Sample swabbing occurred concurrent with regular husbandry and health assessment monitoring that together was deemed a de minimus activity and did not require IACUC approval.DNA extraction. On the basis of the protocol testing results, DNA extraction was performed in accordance with the KatharoSeq protocol (Mo Bio PowerMag kit with ClearMag beads) and quantified down to 1 pg/µl with the Qubit (Thermo, Fisher). DNA-positive controls consisted of B. subtilis flow sorted into 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cells (n = 3 each). Blanks with no cells were also included.Amplicon library construction. 16S rRNA amplicon PCR amplification was performed as described in the KatharoSeq protocol in Fig. 2, with all amplicons pooled at equal volumes of 20 µl and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. Sample volumes were equally pooled regardless of the presence of an amplicon band to reduce false negatives (Fig. S2) and as a comparative measure of the relative starting DNA biomass. PCR positive controls consisted of V. fischeri at 0.1 to 500,000 genome copies (estimated by Qubit DNA concentration). Internal transcribed spacer PCR amplification with bar-coded primers ITS1f/ITS2 was also performed, but all samples failed to produce any detectable library and thus were not sequenced.Amplicon data analyses. De novo sOTU picking was performed in Qiita (qiita.microbio.me) and QIIME as described above. Microbial richness was measured by determining the number of observed sOTUs per sample. The mean compositions of highly abundant OTUs from the QIIME analysis of the JPL SAF floor samples and across the various positive and negative controls are summarized in Fig. S3. Finer-grained de novo sequence analysis was performed by deblur (25) and visualized in Calour (http://github.com/amnona/calour), providing single-nucleotide polymorphism resolution (Fig. S3). Microbial diversity was calculated by determining the total number of observed sOTUs per sample. Differential abundances of JPL SAF floor microbes were compared to JPL positive controls by using a permutation-based group mean comparison with the FDR controlled to 0.05 by using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (29) within Calour (Fig. S3). Spatial mapping was performed with ili, a toolbox for molecular mapping in two and three dimensions (30) (Fig. 3d). To evaluate a deeper taxonomic resolution on the JPL SAF samples, we processed the JPL plates through the Kapa Hyper Plus library prep protocol. Only one of the two plates had enough DNA after library preparation to load onto the HiSeq Rapid Run 2 × 250-bp run.Shotgun metagenomic data analyses. The sequencing data were processed through Trimmomatic 0.36 (31) to trim off low-quality reads and Bowtie 2.2.9 (32) against human reference genome assembly GRCh38 to remove potential human contamination. Taxonomic profiling was conducted with Kraken 0.10.5 (33) against a database that contains all of the complete genomes in the  RefSeq database under the categories bacteria, archaea, viral, protozoa, fungi, and human as of November 2016. Relative abundances of taxa were computed by dividing the sequences assigned to this taxon against the total number of processed sequences. Selected V. fischeri gDNA-spiked samples were subjected to de novo assembly with SPAdes 3.9 (34). The resulting contigs were qualified with QUAST 4.3 (35) and further scaffolded with Ragout 1.2 (36) against the V. fischeri ES114 reference genome (RefSeq accession no. GCF_000011805.1). The resulting draft genomes were aligned with the reference genome by using Brig 0.95 (37). Default parameter settings were used for these programs unless otherwise stated.Data availability. Data from all of the experiments described here have been made publicly available in Qiita (Qiita study ID 10934, prep 3975, https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10934) and ENA (RefSeq accession no. EBI ERP105802). FIG S5 Alignment of draft V. fischeri genome assembled from spiked controls with the reference genome. Download FIG S5, TIF file, 1.3 MB (1.3MB, tif) . Copyright © 2018 Minich et al.

Copyright notice ID: 6013642 PMID: 29930033 ABSTRACT Here, we present the draft whole-genome sequence of a clinical isolate of Fusarium fujikuroi cultured from a patient undergoing chemotherapy for refractory acute myeloid leukemia.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Fusarium was first discovered in 1958, and while notorious for causing the devastating disease it causes in plants and crops, it is now recognized as an emerging global opportunistic human pathogen causing numerous cases of fusariosis every year (1, 2). While roughly 80% of the human cases of fusariosis are caused by members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, there are many infections attributed to the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex. Here, we report the draft whole-genome sequence of F. fujikuroi strain COH1152, which was isolated from a 68-year-old male with refractory acute myeloid leukemia. While undergoing chemotherapy, he developed a large lesion on his left leg after sustaining minor trauma, followed by neutropenic fever and multiple small painful nodules on his face, abdomen, and thighs. The biopsy sample of the left thigh skin lesion showed invasive hyphal elements, and a Fusarium sp., as identified by morphology, was isolated from both blood and tissue cultures. A Fusarium isolate, cultured from the blood and denoted COH1152, was sent for whole-genome sequencing and identified as the species F. fujikuroi. The COH1152 genome was paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size, resulting in a total of 41 million reads (GC content, 47.5%). Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch = 2, how accurate the match between the two “adaptor ligated” reads = 30, and how accurate the match between any adaptor = 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (setting, minimum quality required to keep a base = 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 (3), using a k-mer size of 88. The COH1152 genome assembly resulted in a genome size of 48 Mb, with an N50 value of 1,212,708 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 4,495, with a max scaffold length of 6,034,165 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 501. A second clinical Fusarium isolate, COH1141, as identified by morphology, was cultured from another patient also receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. However, the isolate that was sent for whole-genome sequencing was probably a laboratory contaminant of Aspergillus niger. We, however, have chosen to upload its draft genome sequence for public accessibility (k-mer size, 89; genome size, 32 Mb; number of scaffolds over 1 kb, 350). Accession number(s). The assembled whole-genome sequences have been deposited in DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers QBDQ00000000 (Fusarium fujikuroi COH1152) and QBDR00000000 (Aspergillus niger COH1141). The sequences have also been deposited in the NASA GeneLab and can be found online (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-177/).

Copyright notice ID: 5578834 PMID: 28860236 ABSTRACT We report here the draft genome of Solibacillus kalamii ISSFR-015, isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance filter aboard the International Space Station. The draft genome sequence of this strain contains 3,809,180 bp with an estimated G+C content of 38.61%.GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Solibacillus is a novel microbial genus characterized in 2009 by Krishnamurthi et al., who reclassified Bacillus silvestris into the genus Solibacillus, making it the type species (1). The Solibacillus genus was described as comprising Bacillus-like organisms with Gram-positive, rod-shaped cells, and round endospores formed terminally in swollen sporangia. In 2016, Poonam et al. reclassified Bacillus isronensis into the genus Solibacillus and provided an emended description of the genus Solibacillus that showed the peptidoglycan type to be A4α-l Lys-d-Glu and the fatty acid profile to contain iso-C15:0, C16:1ω7c alcohol, and iso-C17:1ω7c, with MK-7 being the major menaquinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine being the major polar lipids (2). Until recently, there were two bacterial species in the genus Solibacillus (S. isronensis and S. silvestris), and draft genomes of both species have been completed (3, 4). In an ongoing microbiological survey from 2014 to 2017, a novel bacterial species was isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter system aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The round spore-forming bacterium was described as Solibacillus kalamii (5), and here we present its draft genome. The HEPA filter was in service for 40 months on the ISS before being brought back to earth for further microbiological and molecular analyses (5). In this study, we characterize the draft whole-genome sequence of strain S. kalamii ISSFR-015 (NRRL 65388T = DSM 101595T), which provides insight on putative genes coding for superoxide dismutase, universal stress proteins, vancomycin resistance, copper resistance, hydrogen peroxide resistance, and arsenic resistance. This evidence is suggestive of the bacterium’s success in surviving the high-stress environment of the ISS and the harsh cleaning procedures during spacecraft assembly. S. kalamii strain ISSFR-015T was sequenced following a shotgun sequencing method using the Illumina MiSeq platform with a paired-end module. A total of 12,244,464 paired-end reads were generated, and CLC Genomics Workbench version 10.0.1 was used to filter for adapter-free, high-quality reads, yielding 8,435,258 reads representing an approximate genome coverage of 332×. These reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench, resulting in 28 contigs with a total size of 3,809,180 and an N50 contig length of 199,024 bp. The largest assembled contig measured 778,658 bp. The  Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline was used for annotating protein-coding genes and other functional elements present in the genome. The genome contained a total of 3,814 genes, of which 3,662 were protein-coding genes. The complete genome of strain ISSFR-015T was 3,809,180 bp in length with an estimated G+C content of 38.61% and with 64 tRNA genes and 18 rRNA (eight 5S, six 16S, and four 23S) genes. Accession number(s). The genome sequences of S. kalamii ISSFR-015 have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number NHNT00000000.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.
